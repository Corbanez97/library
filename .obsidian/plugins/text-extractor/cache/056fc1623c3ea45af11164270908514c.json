On a conventional screen, people with optical aberrations see a blurred image (cen- ter left). Current approaches to aberration-correcting display use multilayer preﬁltering (center) or light ﬁeld displays (center right). While the former technology enhances perceived image sharpness, contrast is severely reduced. Existing light ﬁeld-based solutions offer high con- trast but require a very high angular sampling density, which signiﬁcantly reduces image resolution. In this paper, we explore the convergence of light ﬁeld display optics and computational preﬁltering (right), which achieves high image resolution and contrast simultaneously. Abstract Millions of people worldwide need glasses or contact lenses to see or read properly. We introduce a computational display technol- ogy that predistorts the presented content for an observer, so that the target image is perceived without the need for eyewear. By designing optics in concert with preﬁltering algorithms, the pro- posed display architecture achieves signiﬁcantly higher resolution and contrast than prior approaches to vision-correcting image dis- play. We demonstrate that inexpensive light ﬁeld displays driven by efﬁcient implementations of 4D preﬁltering algorithms can produce the desired vision-corrected imagery, even for higher-order aberra- tions that are difﬁcult to be corrected with glasses. The proposed computational display architecture is evaluated in simulation and with a low-cost prototype device.

Eyeglasses have been the pri- mary tool to correct such aberrations since the 13th century. Recent decades have seen contact lenses and refractive surgery supplement available options to correct for refractive errors. Unfortunately, all of these approaches are intrusive in that the observer either has to use eyewear or undergo surgery, which can be uncomfortable or even dangerous. Within the last year, two vision-correcting computational display architectures have been introduced as non-intrusive alternatives. Pamplona et al. [2012] proposed to use light ﬁeld displays to en- able the display to correct the observer’s visual aberrations. This correction relies on a 2D image to be shown within the observer’s focal range, outside the physical display enclosure. Light ﬁeld displays offering such capabilities require extremely high angular sampling rates, which signiﬁcantly reduce spatial image resolution. As a high-resolution alternative, Huang et al. [2012] proposed a multilayer device that relies on preﬁltered image content. Unfortu- nately, the required preﬁltering techniques for these particular op- tical conﬁgurations drastically reduce image contrast. In this pa- per, we explore combinations of viewer-adaptive preﬁltering with off-the-shelf lenslets or parallax barriers and demonstrate that the resulting vision-correcting computational display system facilitates signiﬁcantly higher contrast and resolution as compared to previous solutions (see Fig. 1). While light ﬁeld displays have conventionally been used for glasses-free 3D image presentation, correcting for visual aberra- tions of observers is a promising new direction with direct ben- eﬁts for millions of people. We believe that our approach is the ﬁrst to make such displays practical by providing both high reso- lution and contrast—the two design criteria that have been driving the display industry for the last decade. We envision future display systems to be integrated systems comprising ﬂexible optical con-blurred imageconventional displayperceived blurring kernel focal rangehigh-res, low contrastmultilayer display(prefiltered) shared pixels with mixed colors shared view with mixed colors effective pixel sizehigh-res, high contrastproposed display(prefiltered)low-res, high contrasttailored display(ray-traced) effective pixel size Figure 2: Illustration of vision-correcting displays. Observing a conventional 2D display outside the focal range of the eye results in a blurred image (top). A multilayer display with preﬁltered im- age generation (second row) allows for improved image sharpness at the cost of reduced contrast. Image contrast can be preserved using a light ﬁeld approach via lenslet arrays on the screen (third row); this approach severely reduces image resolution. Combin- ing light ﬁeld display and computational preﬁltering, as proposed in this paper (bottom), allows for vision-correcting image display with signiﬁcantly improved image resolution and contrast. ﬁgurations combined with sophisticated computing that allow for different modes, such as 2D, glasses-free 3D, or vision-correcting image display. We explore computational displays with applications in correcting visual aberrations of human observers. In particular, we make the following contributions: • We introduce a novel vision-correcting computational display system that leverages readily available hardware components in concert with light ﬁeld preﬁltering algorithms. • We analyze vision-correcting displays in the frequency do- main and show that light ﬁeld displays provide fundamentally more degrees of freedom than other approaches. • We demonstrate that light ﬁeld preﬁltering offers beneﬁts over alternative vision-correcting displays: image resolution and contrast are signiﬁcant enhanced; implementations with par- allax barriers are brighter and lenslet-based devices have thin- ner form factors. • We evaluate the proposed display system using a wide range of simulations and build a low-cost prototype device that demonstrates correction of myopia and hyperopia in practice. 1.1 Overview of Limitations The proposed system requires modiﬁcations to conventional dis- play hardware and increased computational resources. Although our displays provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts over previous work, small tradeoffs in both resolution and contrast have to be made compared to conventional 2D displays. We evaluate the prototype using pho- tographs taken with aperture settings corresponding to those of the human eye and with simulations using computational models of hu- man perception. However, we do not run a full-ﬂedged user study. A commercial implementation of the proposed technology may re- quire eye tracking, which is outside the scope of this paper. Our academic display prototype exhibits color artifacts that are due to moir´e between the parallax barrier and the display subpixels. These artifacts could be removed with diffusing ﬁlms tailored for the sub- pixel structure of the screen. Finally, the employed parallax barriers reduce image brightness. 2 Related Work Light Fields and Computational Ophthalmology Since their introduction to computer graphics, light ﬁelds [Levoy and Hanra- han 1996; Gortler et al. 1996] have become one of the most fun- damental tools in computational photography. Frequency analy- ses [Durand et al. 2005], for instance, help better understand the theoretical foundations of ray-based light transport whereas appli- cations range from novel camera designs, e.g. [Levin et al. 2009], and aberration correction in light ﬁeld cameras [Ng and Hanrahan 2006], to low-cost devices that allow for diagnosis of refractive errors [Pamplona et al. 2010] or cataracts [Pamplona et al. 2011] in the human eye. These applications are examples of computa- tional ophthalmology, where interactive techniques are combined with computational photography and display for medical applica- tions. Light Field Displays Glasses-free 3D or light ﬁeld displays were invented in the beginning of the 20th century. The two dominating technologies are lenslet arrays [Lippmann 1908] and parallax barri- ers [Ives 1903]. Today, a much wider range of different 3D display technologies are available, including volumetric displays [Cossairt et al. 2007; Jones et al. 2007], multifocal displays [Akeley et al. 2004; Love et al. 2009], and super-multi-view displays [Takaki 2006]. Volumetric displays create the illusion of a virtual 3D ob- ject ﬂoating inside the physical device enclosure; an observer can accommodate within this volume. Multifocal displays allow for the display of imagery on different focal planes but require either multi- ple devices in a large form factor [Akeley et al. 2004] or vary-focal glasses to be worn [Love et al. 2009]. Super-multi-view displays emit light ﬁelds with an extremely high angular resolution, which is achieved by employing many spatial light modulators. Most re- cently, near-eye light ﬁeld displays [Lanman and Luebke 2013] and compressive light ﬁeld displays [Lanman et al. 2010; Wetzstein et al. 2012; Maimone et al. 2013; Hirsch et al. 2014] have been introduced. With the exception of [Maimone et al. 2013], none of these technologies is demonstrated to support accommodation. A recent survey of computational displays can be found in Masia et al. [2013]. Building light ﬁeld displays that support all depth cues, including binocular disparity, motion parallax, and accommodation, in a thin form factor is one of the most challenging problem in display design today. The support for accommodation allows an observer to fo- cus on virtual images that ﬂoat at a distance to the physical device. This capability would allow for the correction of low-order visual aberrations, such as myopia and hyperopia. Maimone et al. [2013] demonstrate the ﬁrst single-device solution for this problem that does not require glasses; their device form-factor is—unlike ours— not suitable for mobile displays. We propose a different strategy: rather than aiming for the support of all depth cues with a single device, we employ simple parallax barriers or lenslet arrays with a very narrow ﬁeld of view to only support accommodation, but not binocular disparity or motion parallax. That means glasses-free 3D display may not be possible with the proposed devices. How- ever, our approach allows us to use inexpensive add-ons to exist- ing phones or tables, facilitating eyeglasses-free 2D image display for observers with visual aberrations, including myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. Vision-correcting Displays Devices tailored to correct visual aberrations of human observers have recently been introduced. Early approaches attempt to pre-sharpen a 2D image presented on a conventional screen with the inverse point spread function (PSF) of the observer’s eye [Alonso Jr. and Barreto 2003; Yellott and Yellott 2007; Archand et al. 2011]. Although these methods slightly im- prove image sharpness, the problem itself is ill-posed. Fundamen- tally, the PSF of an eye with refractive errors is usually a low-pass ﬁlter—high image frequencies are irreversibly canceled out in the optical path from display to the retina. To overcome this limitation, Pamplona et al. [2012] proposed the use of 4D light ﬁeld displays with lenslet arrays or parallax barriers to correct visual aberrations. For this application, the emitted light ﬁelds must provide a sufﬁ- ciently high angular resolution so that multiple light rays emitted by a single lenslet enter the same pupil (see Fig. 2). This approach can be interpreted as lifting the problem into a higher-dimensional (light ﬁeld) space, where the inverse problem becomes well-posed. Unfortunately, conventional light ﬁeld displays as used by Pam- plona et al. [2012] are subject to a spatio-angular resolution trade- off: an increased angular resolution decreases the spatial resolu- tion. Hence, the viewer sees a sharp image but at a signiﬁcantly lower resolution than that of the screen. To mitigate this effect, Huang et al. [2011; 2012] recently proposed to use multilayer dis- play designs together with preﬁltering. While this is a promising, high-resolution approach, combining preﬁltering and these particu- lar optical setups signiﬁcantly reduces the resulting image contrast. Pamplona et al. [2012] explore the resolution-limits of available hardware to build vision-correcting displays; Huang et al. [2011; 2012] show that computation can be used to overcome the reso- lution limits, but at the cost of decreased contrast. The approach proposed in this paper combines both methods by employing 4D light ﬁeld preﬁltering with hardware designs that have previously only been used in a “direct” way, i.e. each screen pixel corresponds to one emitted light ray. We demonstrate that this design allows for signiﬁcantly higher resolutions as compared to the “direct” method because angular resolution demands are decreased. At the same time, image contrast is signiﬁcantly increased, compared to previ- ous preﬁltering approaches, because of the hardware we use. 3 Light Field Transport and Inversion In this section, we derive the optical image formation of a light ﬁeld on the observer’s retina as well as image inversion methods. For this purpose, we employ a two-plane parameterization [Levoy and Hanrahan 1996; Chai et al. 2000] of the light ﬁelds emitted by the device and inside the eye. The forward and inverse models in this section are derived for two-dimensional “ﬂatland” light ﬁelds with straightforward extensions to the full four-dimensional formu- lations. 3.1 Retinal Light Field Projection We deﬁne the lateral position on the retina to be x and that on the pupil to be u (see Fig. 3). The light ﬁeld l (x, u) describes the radi- ance distribution inside the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina aver- age over radiance incident from all angles; therefore, the perceived intensity i (x) is modeled as the projection of l along its angular dimension: i (x) = ∫ Ωu l (x, u) du, (1) where Ωu is the integration domain, which is limited by the ﬁ- nite pupil size. Vignetting and other angle-dependent effects are absorbed in the light ﬁeld. Assuming that the display is capable of emitting a light ﬁeld that contains spatial variation over the screen plane xd and angular variation over the pupil plane ud, allows us to model the radiance distribution entering the eye as a light ﬁeld ld ( xd, ud) . Note that the coordinates on the pupil plane for the light ﬁelds inside the eye and on the display are equivalent (u ≜ ud). Refractions and aberrations in the eye are modeled as a mapping function φ : R × R → R from the spatio-angular coordinates of l to a location on the screen, such that x d = φ(x, u). Equation 1 therefore becomes i (x) = ∫ ∞ −∞ ld (φ (x, u) , u) A (u) du. (2) Here, the effect of the ﬁnite pupil diameter r is a multiplication of the light ﬁeld with the pupil function A (u) = rect ( u r ) . In the full 4D case, the rect function is replaced by a circular function modeling the shape of the pupil. Following standard ray transfer matrix notation [Hecht 2001], the mapping between rays incident on the retina and those emitted by the screen can be modeled as the combined effect of transport be- tween retina and pupil by distance De, refraction of the lens with focal length f , and transport between pupil and screen by distance Do. In matrix notation, this transformation is expressed as (φ(x, u) ud ) = ( − Do De Do∆ 0 1 )( x u ) = T ( x u ) (3) where T is the concatenation of the individual propagation opera- tors and ∆ = 1 De − 1 f + 1 Do . We derive Equation 3 in Supplemental Section A. As a ﬁrst-order approximation, Equation 3 only models the defocus of the eye by considering its focal length f , which may be constrained due to the observer’s limited accommodation range. However, astigmatism and higher-order aberrations can be included in this formulation (see Sec. 6.2). Discretizing Equations 2 and 3 results in a linear forward model: i = Pld, (4) where the matrix P ∈ RN ×N encodes the projection of the dis- crete, vectorized 4D light ﬁeld l d ∈ RN emitted by the display onto the retina i ∈ R N . For the remainder of the paper, we assume that the number of emitted light rays N is the same as the discretized locations on the retina, which makes P square.

The light ﬁeld emitted by a display is parameterized by its coordinates on the screen x d, on the pupil u, and on the retina x (a). This light ﬁeld propagates through the pupil and is projected into a 2D image on the retina. For an in-focus display, the light ﬁeld incident on the retina is a horizontal line in the frequency domain (b). For a displayed image outside the accommodation range of the observer, the corresponding light ﬁeld is slanted and energy is lost at some spatial frequencies (c). Multilayer displays utilize an additional display layer to preserve all spatial frequencies (d). With light ﬁeld displays, frequency loss is also avoided; the perceived image frequencies are a combination of all spatio-angular frequencies of the incident light ﬁeld (e). The ray paths in (a) show two effects for a hyperopic eye observing a light ﬁeld display. First, each photoreceptor on the retina averages over multiple neighboring pixels on the screen (green shaded regions). Second, each pixel on the screen (e.g., x d 0) emits different intensities toward different regions on the pupil (u0, u1), allowing the same pixel to appear differently when observed from different locations (x0, x1) on the retina (red arrows). 3.2 Inverse Light Field Projection The objective of an aberration-correcting display is to present a 4D light ﬁeld to the observer, such that a desired 2D retinal projection is perceived. Assuming that viewing distance, pupil size, and other parameters are known, the emitted light ﬁeld can be found by opti- mizing the following objective function: minimize {ld} ∥i − Pl d∥2 subject to 0 ≤ ld i ≤ 1, for i = 1 . . . N (5) Here, i is the target image (given in normalized power per unit area) and the constraints of the objective account for physically feasible pixel states of the screen. Equation 5 can be solved using stan- dard non-negative linear solvers, we employ LBFGSB [Byrd et al. 1995]. As shown in the following frequency interpretation and in Section 4, Equation 5 is an ill-posed problem for conventional 2D displays. The problem becomes invertible through the use of 4D light ﬁeld displays. 3.3 Frequency Domain Analysis While Equation 5 allows for optimal display pixels states to be de- termined, a natural question that remains is ‘Which display type is best suited for aberration-correction?’. We attempt to answer this question in two different ways: with a frequency analysis derived in this section and with an analysis of the conditioning of projection matrix P in Section 4. Frequency analyses have become standard tools to generate an intu- itive understanding of performance bounds of computational cam- eras and displays (e.g., [Durand et al. 2005; Levin et al. 2009; Wet- zstein et al. 2011]), we follow this approach. First, we note that the coordinate transformation T between display and retina can be used to model corresponding transformation in the frequency do- main via the Fourier linear transformation theorem: (ωd x ωd u ) = ( − De Do 0 De∆ 1 )( ωx ωu ) = ˆT ( ωx ωu ) , (6) where ωx, ωu are the spatial and angular frequencies of the light ﬁeld inside the eye, ωd x, ωd u the corresponding frequencies on the display, and ˆT = T −T [Ramamoorthi et al. 2007]. One of the most interesting results of the frequency analysis is the effect of the pupil outlined in Equation 2. The multiplication with the pupil function in the spatial domain becomes a convolution in the frequency domain whereas the projection along the angular di- mension becomes a slicing [Ng 2005] along ωu = 0: ˆi(ωx) = ( ˆl ∗ ˆA ) (ωx, 0) = ∫ Ωωu ˆl (ωx, ωu) ˆA (ωu) dωu = ∫ Ωωu ˆld (− De Do ωx, De∆ωx + ωu ) ˆA (ωu) dωu. (7) Here, ˆ· denotes the Fourier transform of a variable and ˆA (ωu) = sinc (rωu). Note that the convolution with the sinc function accu- mulates higher angular frequencies along ωu = 0 before the slic- ing occurs, so those frequencies are generally preserved but are all mixed together (see Figs. 3 b-e). Conventional 2D Displays Equation 7 is the most general for- mulation for the perceived spectrum of an emitted light ﬁeld. The light ﬁeld that can actually be emitted by certain types of dis- plays, however, may be very restricted. In a conventional 2D dis- play, for instance, each pixel emits light isotropically in all direc- tions, which makes the emitted light ﬁeld constant in angle. Its Fourier transform is therefore a Dirac in the angular frequencies (i.e. ˆld ( ωd x, ωd u) = 0 ∀ ωd u ̸= 0). Taking a closer look at Equation 7 with this restriction in mind, allows us to disregard all non-zero angular frequencies of the dis- played light ﬁeld and focus on ωd u = De∆ωx + ωu = 0. As illustrated in Figures 3 (b-c, bottom), the light ﬁeld incident on the retina is therefore a line ωu = −De∆ωx, which we can parame- terize by its slope s = −De∆. Equation 7 simpliﬁes to ˆi2D(ωx) = ˆld (− De Do ωx, 0) sinc (r sωx) . (8) Unfortunately, sinc functions contain a lot of zero-valued posi- tions, making the correction of visual aberrations with 2D displays an ill-posed problem. Correction with Multilayer Preﬁltering Huang et al. [2012] pro- posed to remedy this ill-posedness by adding an additional layer, such as a liquid crystal display, to the device. Although stacks of liquid crystal panels usually result in a multiplicative image forma- tion (Wetzstein et al. [2011; 2012]), Huang et al. propose to mul- tiplex the displayed patterns in time, which results in an additive image formation because of perceptual averaging via persistence of vision. As illustrated in Figure 3 (d), this changes the frequency domain representation to the sum of two lines with different slopes. Generalizing Equation 8 to multiple display layers results in the following frequency representation of the retinal projection: ˆiml(ωx) = ∑ k ˆl(d,k) ( − De D(o,k) ωx, 0) sinc (rs (k)ωx) , (9) where s (k) is the slope of display layer k and ˆl(d,k) is the light ﬁeld emitted by that layer. The offsets between display layers are chosen so that the envelope of the differently sheared sinc functions con- tains no zeros. While this is conceptually effective, physical con- straints of the display, such as nonnegative pixel states and limited dynamic range, result in a severe loss of contrast in practice. Correction with Light Field Displays As opposed to 2D dis- plays or multilayer displays, light ﬁeld displays have the capability to generate a continuous range of spatio-angular frequencies. Basi- cally, this allows for multiple virtual 2D layers to be emitted simul- taneously, each having a different slope ˜s (see Fig. 3 e). Following the intuition used in Equations 8 and 9, we can write Equation 7 as ˆilf (ωx) = ∫ Ω˜s ˆl (ωx, ˜sωx) ˆA (˜sωx) d˜s (10) = ∫ Ω˜s ˆld (− De Do ωx, De∆ωx + ˜sωx ) sinc (r˜sωx) d˜s. Although Equation 10 demonstrates that light ﬁeld displays support a wide range of frequencies, many different solutions for actually computing them for a target image exist. Pamplona et al. [2012] chose a naive ray-traced solution. Light ﬁeld displays, however, of- fer signiﬁcantly more degrees of freedom, but these are only un- locked by solving the full inverse light ﬁeld projection problem (Eq. 5), which we call “light ﬁeld preﬁltering”. We demonstrate that this approach provides signiﬁcant improvements in image res- olution and contrast in the following sections. 4 Analysis Whereas the previous section introduces forward and inverse image formation and also provides an interpretation in the frequency do- main, we analyze results and capabilities of the proposed method in this section. First, we give an intuitive explanation for when the problem of correcting visual aberrations is actually invertible, and (a) 3x3 prefiltered light field (b) no correction (c) with correction (e) 3 views defocus-sheared (g) 5 views defocus-sheared (d) 3 views (f) 5 views 1st view 2nd view 3rd view pupil aperture ud xd ud xd u x u x display light field retinal light field perceived imagedisplayed image ill-posed prefiltering well-posed prefiltering well-posed prefiltering Figure 4: Light ﬁeld preﬁltering. The proposed preﬁltering ap- proach computes a light ﬁeld (here with 3 × 3 views) that results in a desired 2D projection on the retina of an observer. The preﬁltered light ﬁeld for an example scene is shown in (a), its simulated projec- tion on the retina in (c), and an image observed on a conventional screen in (b). Spatio-angular frequencies of the light ﬁeld are am- pliﬁed, resulting in the desired sharpening when integrated on the retina. Two sample “ﬂatland” light ﬁelds with different angular sampling rates are shown in display (d,f) and in eye (e,g) coordi- nates. Here, the yellow boxes illustrate why 4D light ﬁeld preﬁlter- ing is more powerful than 2D image preﬁltering: a single region on the retina receives contributions from multiple different light ﬁeld views (e,g). Wherever that is the case, the inverse problem of light ﬁeld preﬁltering is well-posed but in other regions the problem is the same as the ill-posed problem faced with conventional 2D dis- plays (e). (Source image courtesy of Kar Han Tan) we follow with a formal analysis of this intuition by evaluating the conditioning of the discrete forward model (Eq. 4). We also eval- uate the contrast of generated imagery and analyze extensions of lateral and axial viewing ranges for an observer. Intuition Figure 4 (a) shows an example of a preﬁltered light ﬁeld with 3 × 3 views for a sample scene. In this example, the different views contain overlapping parts of the target image (yellow box), allowing for increased degrees of freedom for aberration compen- sation. Precisely these degrees of freedom are what makes the prob- lem of correcting visual aberrations well-posed. The 4D preﬁltering does not act on a 2D image, as is the case for conventional displays, but lifts the problem into a higher-dimensional space in which it becomes invertible. Although the preﬁltered light ﬁeld (Fig. 4, a) appears to contain ampliﬁed high frequencies in each view of the 0 2 4 12 11.5 22.5 33.5 4 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 6 8 10 00.5 kernelodiameter (inoscreenopixels) angularosamplingorate (raysoenteringotheopupil)conditiononumbero(x104) Figure 5: Conditioning analysis. The light ﬁeld projection matrix corresponding to a defocused eye is ill-conditioned. With more an- gular resolution available in the emitted light ﬁeld, more degrees of freedom are added to the system, resulting in lower condition numbers (lower is better). The condition number of the projection matrix is plotted for a varying defocus distance (kernel size) and angular resolution (number of light ﬁeld views). We observe that even as few as 1.5 angular light ﬁeld samples entering the pupil of an observer decrease the condition number. light ﬁeld, the preﬁlter actually acts on all four dimensions simul- taneously. When optically projected onto the retina of an observer, all light ﬁeld views are averaged, resulting in a perceived image that has signiﬁcantly improved sharpness (c) as compared to an image observed on a conventional 2D display (b). We illustrate this principle using an intuitive 2D light ﬁeld in Fig- ures 4 (d-g). The device emits a light ﬁeld with three (d,e) and ﬁve (f,g) views, respectively. Individual views are shown in differ- ent colors. These are sheared in display space (d,f), because the eye is not actually focused on the display due to the constrained accommodation range of the observer. The ﬁnite pupil size of the eye limits the light ﬁeld entering the eye, as illustrated by the semi- transparent white regions. Whereas we show the light ﬁelds in both display coordinates (d,f) and eye (e,g) coordinates, the latter is more intuitive for understanding when vision correction is possible. For locations on the retina that receive contributions from multiple dif- ferent views of the light ﬁeld (indicated by yellow boxes in e,g), the inverse problem is well-posed. Regions on the retina that only receive contributions from a single light ﬁeld view, however, are optically equivalent to the conventional 2D display case, which is ill-posed for vision correction. Conditioning Analysis To formally verify the discussed intu- ition, we analyze the condition number of the light ﬁeld projection matrix P (see Eqs. 4, 5). Figure 5 shows the matrix conditioning for varying amounts of defocus and angular light ﬁeld resolution (lower condition number is better). Increasing the angular resolu- tion of the light ﬁeld passing through the observer’s pupil signiﬁ- cantly decreases the condition number of the projection matrix for all amounts of defocus. This results in an interesting observation: increasing the amount of defocus increases the condition number but increasing the angular sampling rate does the opposite. Note that the amount of defocus is quantiﬁed by the size of a blur kernel on the screen (see Fig. 5). 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.7 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 20 dB 25 dB 30 dB 35 dB 40 dB 45 dB 50 dB contrastPSNR angular sampling rate (rays entering the pupil) Target Image Conventional Display no processing 25 dB / 89% contrast 35 dB / 17% contrast 40 dB / 74% contrast 35 dB / 100% contrast Conventional Display with prefiltering Proposed Display with prefiltering (a) (b) (c) Figure 6: Tradeoff between angular light ﬁeld resolution and im- age contrast.

Bottom: using preﬁltering with a conventional 2D display (b), we obtain either a low-quality but high-contrast image or a high-quality but low-contrast image. For a light ﬁeld display with 1.5 or more preﬁltered views entering the pupil (c), a similar trend is observed but overall reconstruction quality is signiﬁcantly increased. (Snellen chart courtesy of Wikipedia user Jeff Dahl) The condition number drops signiﬁcantly after it passes the 1.3 mark, where the angular sampling enables more than one light ﬁeld view to enter the pupil. This effectively allows for angular light ﬁeld variation to be exploited in the preﬁltering. As more than two light ﬁeld views pass through the pupil, the condition number keeps decreasing but at a much slower rate. With an extreme around 7 to 9 views, the system becomes the setup of Pamplona et al.: each ray hits exactly one retinal pixel, but the spatial-angular trade-off reduces the image resolution. Our light ﬁeld preﬁltering method is located in between these two extremes of choosing either high reso- lution or high contrast, but never both simultaneously. Usually, less than two views are required to maintain a sufﬁciently low condition number. The experiments in Figure 5 are computed with a viewing distance of 350mm, a pupil diameter of 6mm, and a pixel pitch of 45µm. The angular sampling rate refers to the number of light ﬁeld views entering the pupil.

Only slight ringing is visible and, due to peri- odic viewing zones of the employed parallax barrier display, image quality varies in a periodic manner (top, zoom-in). We can account for a range of perspectives in the compensation, ensuring high im- age quality for a wider viewing range (blue plot). The columns on the bottom right show on-axis and off-axis views with and without accounting for a range of lateral viewpoints in the optimization. (Source image courtesy of Wikipedia user Lexaxis7) in Equation 5 results in additional artifacts as shown in (b, top). Al- ternatively, we can shift and scale the target image before solving the system, effectively scaling the target image into the range space of the projection matrix. Although this is a user-deﬁned process, observed image quality can be enhanced. In particular, Equation 5 can be modiﬁed as minimize {ld} ∥(i + b)/(1 + b) − Pl d∥2 subject to 0 ≤ ld i ≤ 1, for i = 1 . . . N (11) where b is a user speciﬁed bias term that reduces the image contrast to 1/(b + 1). We plot achieved image quality measured in PSNR for all contrast levels at various angular sampling rates in Figure 6 (top). With a conventional display, preﬁltering results in ringing artifacts (b) because the inverse problem is ill-conditioned. Artiﬁcially reducing the image contrast mitigates the artifacts but makes the text illegible (b, bottom). A light ﬁeld display makes the inverse problem well- posed, allowing for high quality preﬁltering (c). The pixel pitch of the experiment shown in Figure 6 is 96µm; other parameters are the same as in Figure 5. Please note that the contrast bias term b may require manual tuning for each experiment. Extending Lateral and Axial Viewing Range We envision most future display systems that incorporate vision-correcting technolo- gies to use eye tracking. In such devices, the projection matrix (see Eq. 4) is dynamically updated for the perspective of the observer. For applications in emerging near-eye displays [Lanman and Lue- bke 2013], on the other hand, the proposed technology would not require eye-tracking because the relative position between eye and display is ﬁxed. Within the context of this paper, we assume that eye tracking is either available or the relative position between dis- play and eye is ﬁxed.withoutoptimizationoptimized for extended range Defocus-error = −20mm Defocus-error = 0mm Defocus-error = +20mm PSNR = 29 dB PSNR = 30 dB PSNR = 27 dB PSNR = 20 dB PSNR = 41 dB PSNR = 21 dB Figure 8: Accounting for a range of viewing distances. Top row: when considering a ﬁxed viewing distance, defocus errors are com- pensated at that exact distance (top center) but image quality de- grades when the observer moves forward or back (top left and right). The proposed method can account for a range of view- ing distances (bottom row), which slightly degrades quality at the sweetspot but signiﬁcantly improves all other distances. (Source image courtesy of Kar Han Tan) Nevertheless, we evaluate image degradation for viewpoints that are at a lateral distance from the target viewpoint in Figure 7. Such shifts could be caused by imprecise tracking or quickly moving ob- servers. We observe slight image degradation in the form of ring- ing. However, even the degraded image quality is above 30 dB in this experiment and varies in a periodic manner (Fig. 7, top: zoom- in). This effect can be explained by the periodic viewing zones that are created by the employed parallax barrier display; a similar effect would occur for lenslet-based light ﬁeld displays. We can account for a range of lateral viewpoints by changing the matrix in Equation 11 to P = [PT1 . . . PTM ]T , where each PTi is the projection matrix of one of M perspectives. Although this approach slightly degrades image quality for the central sweetspot, a high im- age quality (approx. 35 dB) is achieved for a much wider range of viewpoints. The lateral range tested in Figure 7 is large enough to demonstrate successful aberration-correction for binocular vision, assuming that the inter-ocular distance is approx. 65 mm. Please also refer to additional experiments in the supplemental video. We also show results for a viewer moving along the optical axis in Figure 8. Just like for lateral motion, we can account for vari- able distances by stacking multiple light ﬁeld projection matrices into Equation 11 with incremental defocus distances. The resulting equation system becomes over-constrained, so the solution attempts to satisfy all viewing distances equally well. This results in slight image degradations for the sweetspot, but signiﬁcantly improves image quality for all other viewing distances. 5 Implementation and Results The proposed aberration-correcting display can be implemented us- ing most light ﬁeld display technologies. For the purpose of this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques with a par- allax barrier display [Ives 1903], because the required hardware is readily available and inexpensive. Please note that the proposed displays are not limited to this particular architecture, although the image formation (Eq. 4) has to be adjusted for any particular setup. Hardware The prototype is shown in Figure 9. A pinhole-based parallax barrier mask is printed with 5080 DPI on a transparency with a Heidelberg Herkules imagesetter (www.pageworks.com). To optimize light throughput and avoid diffraction, the pinholes have a size of 75 microns each and are spaced 390 microns apart. This mask is mounted at an offset of 5.4 mm in front of a conventional Figure 9: Prototype display. We construct an aberration- correcting display using parallax barriers. The barrier mask con- tains a pinhole array (left) that is mounted at a slight offset in front of an Apple iPod touch 4 screen (lower right). The display emits a light ﬁeld with a high-enough angular resolution so that at least two views enter the pupil of a human observer. This effect is il- lustrated on the top right: multiple Arabic numerals are emitted in different viewing directions; the ﬁnite pupil size then creates an av- erage of multiple different views on the retina (here simulated with a camera). 2D screen using a clear acrylic spacer. The screen is an Apple iPod touch 4th generation display with a pixel pitch of 78 microns (326 PPI) and a total resolution of 960 × 640 pixels. The dimensions of our prototype allow 1.66 light ﬁeld views to enter a human pupil with a diameter of 6 mm at a distance of 25 cm. Higher-resolution panels are commercially available and would directly improve spatial and angular resolution and also fa- cilitate larger viewing distances. Software The light ﬁeld preﬁltering algorithm is implemented in Matlab on a PC with a 2.7GHz 2-core CPU and 8GB of RAM. The projection matrix is precomputed in about 3 minutes with radiances sampling the pupil at 20 rays/mm, resulting in approx. 11,300 ef- fective rays per retinal pixel. We use the non-negative least squares solver package LBFGSB [Byrd et al. 1995] to solve Equation 11 in about 20 seconds for each image shown on the prototype. The projection matrix only needs to be computed once for each viewing distance and we believe that an optimized GPU implementation of the solver could achieve real-time framerates. Photographs of Prototype We show a variety of results cap- tured from our prototype display in Figure 10 (center right column). These photographs are captured with a Canon T3i DSLR camera equipped with a 50 mm lens at f/8. The display is placed at a dis- tance of 25 cm to the camera. The camera is focused at 38 cm, placing the screen 13 cm away from the focal plane. This camera closely resembles a -6D hyperopic human eye. Figure 10 (right column) shows the simulated results corrected with our techniques. The results captured from the prototype (Fig. 10, third column) closely resemble these simulations but contain mi- nor artifacts that are due to moir´e between the barrier mask and the display pixels. Compared to conventional 2D images shown on the screen (Fig. 10, ﬁrst column), image sharpness is signiﬁ- cantly improved without requiring the observer to wear glasses. We also compare our approach to the method proposed by Pamplona et al. [2012] for the same display resolution and spatio-angular trade- off (Fig. 10, second column). Basically, their approach uses the same display setup as ours but a direct solution rather than the pro- posed preﬁlter. Our approach outperforms their method and allows for signiﬁcantly increased resolution. proposed method simulation conventional display photograph [Pamplona et al.2012] photograph proposed method photograph Figure 10: Photographs of prototype display. The hyperopic cam- era simulates a human pupil with a diameter of 6 mm at a distance of 25 cm to the screen. Focused at 38 cm, images shown on a con- ventional screen are blurred (ﬁrst column). While previous meth- ods theoretically facilitate increased image sharpness (second col- umn), achievable resolution is fundamentally limited by the spatio- angular resolution tradeoff of the required light ﬁeld display. Light ﬁeld preﬁltering, as proposed in this paper, allows for signiﬁcantly increased resolutions (third column). The prototype closely resem- bles simulations (right column).

For this experiment, we simulate a 10 inch tablet with a 300 PPI panel and the pinhole parallax barrier with 6.5 mm offset. The tablet is held at a dis- tance of 30 cm and viewed with a -6.75D hyperopic eye; images are shown on the center of the display in a 10.8 cm × 10.8 cm area.

We compare simulations of conventional and vision-correcting image display qualitatively and quantitatively using contrast and quality-mean-opinion-square (QMOS) error metrics. A conventional out-of-focus display always appears blurred (second column). Multilayer displays with preﬁltering improve image sharpness but at a much lower contrast (third column). Light ﬁeld displays without preﬁltering require high angular resolutions, hence provide a low spatial resolution (fourth column). The proposed method combines preﬁltering and light ﬁeld display to optimize image contrast and sharpness (right column). The QMOS error metric is a perceptually linear metric, predicting perceived quality for a human observer. We also plot maps that illustrate the probability of an observer detecting the difference of a displayed image to the target image (bottom row). Our method performs best in most cases. (Source images courtesy of Jameziecakes (ﬂickr), Kar Han Tan, Mostaque Chowdhury (ﬂickr), and Thomas Quine (ﬂickr)) ﬁeld approach and multilayer preﬁltering. The target contrast for preﬁltering methods is manually adjusted to achieve the best PSNR for each example. Contrast Metric Preﬁltering involves modulating the image con- tent by enhancing weaker frequencies. Without utilizing the full degrees of freedom in the light ﬁeld sense, the results obtained us- ing multilayer preﬁltering suffer from extreme contrast loss, here measured in Michelson contrast. This is deﬁned as (Imax − Imin)/(Imax +Imin), where Imax,min are the maximum and min- imum intensity in the image, respectively. Light ﬁeld predistortion does not depend on content modiﬁcations but on resampling of the light ﬁeld, so the contrast is not sacriﬁced. By efﬁciently using all views, the proposed light ﬁeld preﬁltering approach restores con- trast by a factor of 3 to 5× higher than that of the multilayer pre- ﬁltering. We note that the contrast achieved with light ﬁeld preﬁlter- ing is not quite as good as the raytracing algorithm, which always gives full contrast. However, when closely inspecting the image content, the raytracing solution always results in blurred images, which is due to insufﬁcient spatial resolution. Perceptual Metric To assess both contrast and sharpness, we re- sort to HDR-VDP2 [Mantiuk et al. 2011], a perceptually-based im- age metric. The quality mean opinion score (QMOS) gives an eval- uation of overall perceived image quality, and in most examples we score 2 to 3 times higher than other approaches. The images no correction conventional LF display (a) spherical (b) coma (c) trefoil Figure 12: Correcting for higher-order aberrations. We simulate images observers with different types of higher-order aberrations perceive (top row) and show corresponding point spread functions (top row, insets), which exhibit a range of different shapes. Most of them are difﬁcult to compensate with a conventional 2D display (bottom row, lower left parts), although the blur kernel associated with trefoil (lower right) is frequency preserving and therefore in- vertible. The proposed aberration-correcting display is successful in compensating all of these aberrations (bottom row, upper right parts). (Source image courtesy of ﬂickr user Jameziecakes) in the third row are a particularly difﬁcult example for preﬁltering- based algorithms, because performance depends on the frequency content of the image which, in this case, does not allow preﬁltering to achieve a higher quality. Lots of high frequencies in the example tend to reduce image contrast so that even our light ﬁeld preﬁlter- ing scores slightly lower. Visually, our result still looks sharp. In the last row of Figure 11, we show a probabilistic map on whether a human can detect per pixel differences for the fourth example. Clearly, our result has a much lower detection rate. Note that the reduced image sharpness of conventional displays (Fig. 11, column 2) is due to defocus blur in the eye, whereas that of Tailored Displays (Fig. 11, column 4) is due to the low spatial reso- lution of the light ﬁeld display. All displays in this simulation have the same pixel count, but the microlens array used in Tailored Dis- plays trades spatial display resolution for angular resolution. Our solution also has to trade some spatial resolution, but due to the preﬁltering method we basically optimize this tradeoff. 6.2 Correcting Higher-Order Aberrations Although aberrations of human eyes are usually dominated by my- opia and hyperopia, astigmatism and higher-order aberrations may also degrade observed image quality. Visual distortions of a per- ceived wavefront are usually described by a series of basis func- tions known as Zernike polynomials. These are closely related to spherical harmonics, which are commonly used in computer graph- ics applications. Lower-order Zernike polynomials include defocus and astigmatism whereas higher-order terms include coma, trefoil, spherical aberrations, and many others. The effects of any such terms can easily be incorporated into the image inversion described in Section 3 by modifying the projection matrix P. Figure 12 evaluates compensation of higher-order aberrations with the proposed approach. The top row shows the images an observer with these aberrations perceives without correction. Just as in the case of defocus, preﬁltering for a conventional display usually fails to achieve high image quality (bottom row, lower left image parts). We observe ringing artifacts that are typical for solving ill-posed de- convolution problems. The proposed aberration-correcting display, on the other hand, successfully compensates for all types of aberra- tions (bottom row, upper right parts). What is particularly interest- ing to observe in this experiment is that some types of higher-order aberration can be reasonably well compensated with a conventional display. As seen in the right column of Figure 12 (bottom row, lower left part), the point spread function of trefoil, for example, is frequency preserving and therefore easy to invert. For most other types of aberrations, however, this is not the case. Extended ex- periments including astigmatism and additional higher-order aber- rations can be found in the supplemental document. 7 Discussion In summary, we present a computational display approach to cor- recting low and high order visual aberrations of a human observer. Instead of wearing vision-correcting glasses, the display itself pre- distorts the presented imagery so that it appears as a desired target image on the retina of the observer. Our display architecture em- ploys off-the-shelf hardware components, such as printed masks or lenslet arrays, combined with computational light ﬁeld preﬁltering techniques. We envision a wide range of possible implementations on devices such as phones, tablets, televisions, and head-worn displays. In this paper, we demonstrate one particular implementation using a low- cost hardware add-on to a conventional phone. In a commercial setting, this could be implemented using switchable liquid crystal barriers, similar to those used by Nintendo 3DS, which would allow the display to dynamically adapt to different viewers or viewing conditions. The proposed techniques assume that the precise location of the observer’s eye w.r.t. the screen is either ﬁxed or tracked. Robust so- lutions to eye tracking, however, are not a contribution of this paper. Each of the envisioned display types provides different challenges for tracking pupils. For generality, we focus discussions on the challenges of correcting vision. Inexpensive eye trackers are com- mercially available today (e.g., http://theeyetribe.com) and could be useful for larger-scale vision-correcting displays; hand-held devices could use integrated cameras. Nevertheless, we evaluate strategies to account for a range of viewer motion, which could not only help decrease jittering of existing trackers but also remove the need for tracking in some applications. Beneﬁts and Limitations The proposed techniques offer signif- icantly increased resolution and contrast compared to previously- proposed vision-correcting displays. Intuitively, light ﬁeld preﬁlter- ing minimizes demands on angular light ﬁeld resolution, which di- rectly results in higher spatial resolution. For device implementa- tions with lenslet arrays, the reduced angular resolution, compared to Pamplona et al. [2012], allows for shorter focal lengths of the em- ployed lenslets resulting in thinner form factors and easier fabrica- tion. For implementations with parallax barriers, pinhole spacings are reduced allowing for increased image brightness. We treat lenslet arrays and parallax barriers as very similar optical elements throughout the manuscript. In practice, the image forma- tion is slightly different and the implementation of Equation 4 is adjusted for each case. As outlined in Section 1, the proposed sys- tem requires increased computational resources and modiﬁcations to conventional display hardware. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that an inexpensive hardware attachment for existing phones is suf- ﬁcient to build the required device. Whereas the parallax barriers in our prototype are relatively light inefﬁcient, lenslet arrays could overcome this limitation. Our current Matlab implementation does not support interactive frame rates. Real-time GPU implementa- tions of similar problems [Wetzstein et al. 2012], however, are a strong indicator that interactive framerates could also be achieved for the proposed methods. While the proposed approach provides increased resolution and contrast as compared to previous approaches, achieving the full tar- get image resolution and contrast is not currently possible. We eval- uate all system parameters and demonstrate prototype results under conditions that realistically simulate a human pupil; however, we do not perform a user study. Slight artifacts are visible on the pro- totype, these are mainly due to limitations in how precisely we can calibrate the distance between the pinhole mask and screen pixels, which are covered by protective glass with an unknown thickness. As artifact-free light ﬁeld displays resembling the prototype setup are widely available commercially, we believe that the observed ar- tifacts could be removed with more engineering efforts. The pa- rameter b in Section 4 is manually chosen, but could be incorpo- rated into the optimization, making the problem more complex. We leave this formulation for future research. Future Work We show successful vision-correction for a variety of static images and precomputed animations. In the future, we would like to explore real-time implementations of the proposed techniques that support interactive content. Emerging compressive light ﬁeld displays (e.g., [Wetzstein et al. 2012; Maimone et al. 2013]) are promising architectures for high-resolution display— vision-correcting devices could directly beneﬁt from advances in that ﬁeld. In the long run, we believe that ﬂexible display architec- tures will allow for multiple different modes, such as glasses-free 3D image display, vision-corrected 2D image display, and combi- nations of vision-corrected and 3D image display. We would like to explore such techniques. 8 Conclusion Correcting for visual aberrations is critical for millions of people. Today, most of us spend a signiﬁcant amount of time looking at computer screens on a daily basis. The computational display de- signs proposed in this paper could become a transformative tech- nology that has a profound impact on how we interact with digi- tal devices. Suitable for integration in mobile devices, computer monitors, and televisions, our vision-correcting displays could be- come an integral part of a diverse range of devices. Tailoring vi- sual content to a particular observer may very well turn out to be the most widely used application of light ﬁeld displays. Combined with glasses-free 3D display modes, the proposed techniques fa- cilitate a variety of novel applications and user interfaces that may revolutionize user experiences.
