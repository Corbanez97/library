The current classiﬁcation scheme of supernovae. Type Ia SNe are associated with the thermonuclear explosion of accreting white dwarfs. Other SN types are as- sociated with the core collapse of massive stars. Some type Ib/c and IIn SNe with explosion energies E > 10 52 erg are often called hypernovae. Only in recent years have late time observations contributed to diﬀerentiating various subtypes. The ﬁrst two main classes of SNe were identiﬁed [88] on the basis of the presence or absence of hydrogen lines in their spectra: SNe of type I (SNI) did not show H lines, while those with the obvious presence of H lines were called type II (SNII). Type I SNe were also characterized by a deep absorption at 6150 ˚A which was not present in the spectra of some objects, therefore considered peculiar [16,17]. In 1965, Zwicky [143] introduced a schema of ﬁve classes but in recent years the scarcely populated types III, IV and V have been generally included among type II SNe. In the mid-1980s, evidence began to accumulate that the peculiar SNI formed a class physically distinct from the others. The objects of the new class, charac- terized by the presence of HeI [58,63], were called type Ib (SNIb), and “classical” SNI were renamed as type Ia (SNIa). The new class further branched into another variety, SNIc, based on the absence of He I lines. Whether these are physically distinct types of objects has been long debated [62,135]. In several contexts they are referred to as SNIb/c.

The representative spectra are those of SN1996X for type Ia [109], of SN1994I (left and center) [35] and SN1997B (right) for type Ic, of SN1999dn (left and center) and SN1990I (right) for type Ib, and of SN1987A [99] for type II. At late times (especially in the case of the type Ic SN1997B) the contamination from the host galaxy is evident as an underlying continuum plus unresolved emission lines. In all ﬁgures of this paper the spectra have been transformed to the parent galaxy rest frame. 3 Type Ia Supernovae Type Ia SNe have become very popular in the last decade because of their role in determining the geometry of the Universe with their high luminosity and relatively small luminosity dispersion at maximum. An extensive review of the properties of SNIa has recently appeared [69]. SNIa are discovered in all types of galaxies, also in ellipticals [8], and are not associated with the arms of spirals as strongly as other SN types [85,128]. The spectra are characterized by lines of intermediate mass elements such as calcium, oxygen, silicon and sulfur during the peak phase and by the absence of H at any time (see, e.g., Fig. 2). With age the contribution of the Fe lines increases and several months past maximum the spectra are dominated by [Fe II] and [Fe III] lines. The overall homogeneous spectroscopic and photometric behavior has led 4 Turatto to a general consensus that they are associated with the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf [20]. Nevertheless, during the past decade early suggestions of signiﬁcant diﬀer- ences among SNIa [9,102] have been conﬁrmed by new, high signal-to-noise data. The crucial year was 1991, when the bright, slowly declining SN1991T [74,105], and the faint, intrinsically red and fast declining SN1991bg [50,71,119] were dis- covered. Other under- and over-luminous objects have been found since then [66]. The analysis of homogeneous sets of optical data led to the discovery of a cor- relation between the peak luminosity and the shape of the early light curve with brighter objects having a slower rate of decline than dimmer ones [97,98,100,104]. This correlation has been employed in restoring SNIa as useful distance indica- tors up to cosmological distances. A correlation between the photometric and the spectroscopic properties was also found [90]. It is known that the peak luminosity of SNIa is directly linked to the amount of radioactive 56Ni produced in the explosion [3,5]. Hence SNIa, having diﬀerent magnitudes at maximum, are probably the result of the synthesis of diﬀerent amounts of radioactive 56Ni. Moreover, there are indications of large variances (up to a factor 2) in the total mass of the ejecta [24]. Observations at other wavelengths have provided very useful information. In particular, infrared and I-band light curves have shown that the light curves of SNIa are characterized by a secondary peak 20-30 days after the B maximum [39,74,86,115]. Remarkable exceptions are the faint objects like SN1991bg. The afore mentioned diversity of SNIa persists up to very late epochs. The light curves of faint objects are steeper than those of other SNIa, probably be- cause of a progressive transparency to positrons from radioactive decay [24,87]. Faint SNIa also show slower expansion velocity of the emitting gas both at early [43,125] and late epochs [82]. The calibration of the absolute magnitudes of a number of type Ia SNe by Cepheids has provided the zero point for determining the Hubble Constant (H0). Average values based on limited samples and diﬀerent recipes range from MV = −19.34 to MV = −19.64 with small dispersions [60,68,107,116]. The re- cent determination of the Cepheid distance to the host galaxy of SN1991T seems to conﬁrm that it is brighter (MV = −19.85 ± 0.29) than the spectroscopically normal supernovae [108]. SN1991T was also the ﬁrst SNIa to show photometric and spectroscopic evi- dence of a light echo from circumstellar dust [111]. So far the only other SNIa to show the same phenomenon was the slowly declining, spectroscopically normal SN1998bu [27]. In addition to the light echo, these two SNe suﬀered strong red- dening, quite unusual among known, standard SNIa, suggesting that slow declin- ers may be associated to younger population objects. The fact that, on average, SNIa in late type galaxies have slower decline rates (hence are more luminous) than SNIa in early type galaxies had been already suggested [25,43,61,126]. Classiﬁcation of Supernovae 5 One current issue important for the application of SNIa to cosmology is whether they evolve with redshift. Indeed, the lower metallicity of the progenitors at higher redshift might result in systematic diﬀerences in brightness. 4 Type Ib and Ic Supernovae Type Ib and Ic appear only in spiral type galaxies [8,101] and have been as- sociated with a parent population of massive stars, perhaps more massive than SNII progenitors [128]. SNIb/c exhibit relatively strong radio emission with steep spectral indices and fast turn-on/turn-oﬀ [132], which is thought to arise from the SN shock interaction with a dense circumstellar medium [28,29]. They are, therefore, usually thought to be associated with the core collapse of massive stars which have been stripped of their outer H (and possibly He) envelope. The introduction of this class of SNe is recent. As mentioned above, they were classiﬁed with other SNI until the mid-1980s, when late time observations of SNe 1983N, 1984L and 1985F highlighted the physical diﬀerences from SNIa [31,47,58,63,138]. The characterizing features are the absence of H and Si II lines and the presence of He I. The excited levels of He producing such lines are thought to be populated by fast electrons accelerated by γ-rays from the decay of 56Ni and 56Co [63,75]. It was soon recognized that some objects did not show strong He lines [136] and the class of helium poor type Ic was proposed [62,135]. In order to investigate the physical diﬀerences between these two classes, the signatures of He were searched carefully. The He I λ10830 line in Type Ic was ﬁrst found in the spectra of SN1994I [49] with velocity as high as 17,000 km s−1 [35]. It was noted that even as little as 0.1 M⊙ of helium at such high expansion velocities implies an energy of about 3 × 1051 erg in the outer shell alone. Unless very high explosion energies are involved, the amount of He has to, therefore, be much smaller [35]. Other SNIc have shown He lines at similar (SNe 1987M and 1988L) and slower (SN1990B [38]) velocities. Thus the presence of some amount of He seems to be common to several SNIc progenitors. Helium has been unambiguously identiﬁed also in the spectra of the recent type Ic SN1999cq [76]. These lines have expansion velocities much lower than other lines, indicating that the ejecta interacts with a dense shell of almost pure He originating from a stellar wind or mass transfer to a companion. These ﬁndings support the idea that SNIc diﬀer from SNIb by the He abundance rather than by the amount of mixing of 56Ni in the helium envelope. Absorption features attributed to Hα were ﬁrst identiﬁed in the spectra of the type Ib SNe 1983N and 1984L [137]. Recent analysis of the spectra of 11 objects has suggested that detached H is generally present in SNIb [22]. The optical depths of H and He are not very high, so that modest diﬀerences in the He I line optical depths might transform type Ib into type Ic objects. In addition to the diﬀerent strengths of He lines, it has been suggested [76] that permitted oxygen lines are relatively stronger in type Ic than in Ib and the nebular emission lines broader. In general, type Ib appear more homogeneous than type Ic. 6 Turatto Fig. 3. Comparison among the spectra of SNe reported as type Ib/c in the Asiago SN Catalogue [8] (left: at maximum light; right: 3 weeks later). In addition to the spectra of SN1994I (Ic) and 1999dn (Ib) shown in Fig. 2, the spectra of SN1996aq (Ic), 2000H (Ib) [22] and 1993J (IIb) [7] are displayed. With the exception of SN1993J, the spectra at maximum are rather similar. For reference the position of He I λ5876 (blueshifted by 10,500 km s −1) is marked with a dashed vertical line. The dashed lines on the right indicate the positions of He I λλ 5876, 6678 and 7065 (blueshifted by 16,900 km s −1 for 1994I, 6,000 km s −1 for SN1993J and 9,000 km s −1 for other objects). Hα (solid line, blueshifted by 11,000 km s −1) is also shown. While He I lines in SN1994I are detectable only through a detailed analysis, they are prominent in the spectra of SN1996aq, which should be reclassiﬁed as a SNIb. The light curves of SNIb/c have been divided in two groups depending on the luminosity decline rate [34]. However, the suggestion that type Ic include both fast and slow decliners while Ib seem to prefer slow declines has been challenged by the existence of SNIb with fast light curves, e.g., SNe 1990I and 1991D. With this variety, the classiﬁcation of new objects based on a single spectrum is diﬃcult, and to some extent subjective, so that more detailed analyses of the objects often reveal discrepancies from early classiﬁcations. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 which presnets the optical spectra of a number of objects reported as type Ib/c in the Asiago SN Catalog [8]. Classiﬁcation of Supernovae 7 4.1 Type IIb A few objects have been found to have early time spectra similar to type II (i.e. with prominent H lines) and late time spectra similar to type Ib/c SNe. For this reason they have been called type IIb. The ﬁrst SNIIb was SN1987M [42], but the best studied example, and one of the best studied SNe ever, was SN1993J in M81. The analysis of seven years of observations of this object has been recently published [77,79], and will be discussed in more detail in other chapters of this volume. More examples of transition objects are SN1996cb [141] and probably SN1997dd [78]. Fig. 3 shows that while the early spectrum of SN1993J was almost featureless with a blue continuum and broad H and He I λ5876 lines typical of SNII, already three weeks later it displayed progressively stronger He I λλ 5876, 6678 and 7065 lines characteristic of SNIb. The light curve of SN1993J was unusual with a narrow peak followed by a secondary maximum, recalling the behavior of SN1987A if the time axis were reduced by a factor of four. After another rapid luminosity decline around 50 days past the explosion, the light curve settled into an almost exponential tail with a decline rate faster than normal SNII and similar to that of SNIa, indicative of a small mass for the ejecta. Indeed, the photometry of the progenitor of SN1993J taken before the ex- plosion is inconsistent with the spectral energy distribution of a single star, but requires the composition of a K0Ia spectrum with a hot component [1]. The radio and X-ray emission of SN1993J [11,129,142] have been attributed to cir- cumstellar interaction [54]. Another indication comes from the boxy shape of the emission lines of late time optical spectra [77,94]. Circumstellar gas in proximity to the exploding star was also revealed through the detection of narrow coronal lines persisting for a few days after the explosion [13]. These SNe transforming from type II to Ib/c constitute the previously missing link between envelope retaining and envelope stripped SNe. 5 Type II Supernovae Type II SNe are characterized by the obvious presence of H in their spectra. They avoid early type galaxies [8], are strongly associated with regions of recent star formation [81,128] and are commonly associated with the core collapse of massive stars [140]. SNII display a wide variety of properties both in their light curves [92,93] and in their spectra [44]. Four subclasses of SNII are commonly mentioned in the literature: IIP, IIL, and IIn in addition to the above mentioned IIb. However, a number of peculiar objects do not ﬁt into any of these categories. SNIIP (Plateau) and SNIIL (Linear) constitute the bulk of all SNII, and are often referred as normal SNII. The subclassiﬁcation is made according to the shape of the optical light curves [10]. The luminosity of SNIIP stops declin- ing shortly after maximum forming a plateau 2-3 months long during which a 8 Turatto recombination wave moves through the massive hydrogen envelope releasing its internal energy. SNIIL, on the other hand, show a linear, uninterrupted luminos- ity decline, probably because of a lower mass envelope. Indeed the two classes are not separated and there are a number of intermediate cases with short plateaus, e.g., SN1992H [36]. A quantitative criterion for the classiﬁcation of the light curves has been proposed on the basis of the average decline rate of the ﬁrst 100 days [93]. Starting 150 days past maximum the luminosity of both types settles into an exponential decline, consistent with complete (or constant) trapping of the energy release of the radioactive decay of 56Co into 56Fe. No major spectral diﬀerences exist between SNIIP and SNIIL, although there are recurrent claims that SNIIL do not show the blueshifted absorption of the P-Cygni proﬁle evident in normal SNIIP. Indeed, a statistical analysis has shown that the presence or absence of the P-Cygni absorption is correlated with the absolute brightness at maximum [93]. The progenitors of SNIIL are believed to have H envelopes of the order of 1-2 M⊙, much smaller than those of SNIIP (typically 10 M⊙) probably due to mass loss during the progenitor evolution. A general scenario has been proposed in which common envelope evolution in massive binary systems with varying mass ratios and separations of the components can lead to various degrees of stripping of the envelope [89]. According to this scenario the sequence of types IIP-IIL- IIb-Ib-Ic in Fig. 1 is ordered according to a decreasing mass of the envelope. SNIIL are often radio sources [132] and show UV excess attributed to Comp- ton scattering of photospheric radiation by high speed electrons in shock-heated circumstellar medium (CSM) material [52,53]. A number of SNIIL, e.g., SNe 1994aj and 1996L [12,14], have shown lines with double P-Cygni proﬁles (sometimes dubbed SNIId, “d” for double) indicating the presence of strong wind episodes shortly before the explosion. These and other SNIIL show a ﬂattening in the light curves at late stages, a broadening of the spectral lines, and Hα ﬂuxes greater than those expected from purely radioactive models [23,41,70,124]. These fea- tures have been interpreted as signatures of the onset of interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar material. The epochal SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the ﬁrst SN to be observed by naked eye in the last four centuries, was a “not very peculiar” type II SN with a plateau. Extensive observations at all wavelengths have explored the nature of this object in detail (see, e.g., [4] and references therein). The detection of neutrinos from SN1987A has been a spectacular conﬁrmation of the theory of core collapse [18,64]. The contribution of this object to our understanding of supernovae is addressed by McCray in another chapter in this volume. Because of its closeness, SN1987A was the ﬁrst SN for which it has been pos- sible to unambiguously identify the progenitor, the B3 I star Sk-69 202. More recent, high spatial resolution prediscovery images of nearby galaxies are provid- ing new insights into the nature of the precursor stars of other core collapse SNe. In addition to the case of SN1993J in M81 mentioned above, tight constraints on the mass of the progenitors of SNe 1999em and 1999gi have been published (M (1999gi) < 9+3 −2 M⊙ and M (1999em) < 12 ± 1 M⊙ [113,114]). Classiﬁcation of Supernovae 9 SN1987A was typical in both the explosion energy (∼ 1051 erg) and the amount of ejected radioactive material (M( 56Ni) = 0.07 M⊙). Recent observa- tions of other SNe seem to indicate a considerable dispersion around such values. High explosion energies are required to explain the high luminosities and kinetic energies of hypernovae (see, e.g., §6) and a large mass of radioactive 56Ni (0.3 M⊙) has been measured for SN1992am [112]. At the other extreme the faint SN1997D had a considerably smaller explosion energy (∼ few × 1050 erg) and returned to the ISM a mass of radioactive material as small as M ( 56Ni) = 0.002 M⊙ [122]. The discovery of similar objects (e.g., SN1999eu) indicates that faint, under energetic SNII may represent a non-negligible fraction of all core collapse SNe. These objects are the best candidates for the detection of signatures of black hole formation and for providing support to the black hole-forming SN scenario [6,15]. 5.1 Type IIn A number of peculiar SNII have been grouped into the class of SNIIn (“n” de- noting narrow emission lines [110]). The spectra of these objects have a slow evolution and are dominated by strong Balmer emission lines without the char- acteristic broad absorptions. The early time continua are very blue, He I emission is often present and, in some cases, narrow Balmer and Na I absorptions are visi- ble corresponding to expansion velocities of about 1,000 km s−1[91], reminiscent of SNIId (see §5). Unresolved forbidden lines of [OI], [OIII], and of highly ionized elements such as [FeVII], [FeX], and [AX] are sometimes present. One of the best cases is SN1988Z, which has been observed in the optical, ra- dio and X-rays for over ten years [2]. Balmer lines, in particular Hα, show a well deﬁned multiple component structure with broad (FWHM ∼ 15, 000 km s−1), intermediate (2,200 km s−1) and narrow (< 700 km s−1) components with dif- ferent time evolution [121]. SN1995N was a remarkably similar object, detected in radio and X-rays [51,132]. It is commonly believed that what we observe in these objects is the result of interaction between the ejecta and a dense CSM, which transforms the me- chanical energy of the ejecta into radiation [32,117]. The interaction of the fast ejecta with the slowly expanding CSM generates a forward shock in the CSM and a reverse shock in the ejecta. The shocked material emits energetic radia- tion whose characteristics strongly depend on the density of both the CSM and the ejecta, and on the properties of the shock [30]. Thus the great diversity of observed SNIIn can provide clues to the diﬀerent history of the mass-loss in the late evolution of progenitors. A systematic search for radio emission from SNIIn has produced contradic- tory results [130]. This might be due to the high degree of heterogeneity and to a bias in the classiﬁcation of the targets. In fact, a solid classiﬁcation criterion for these SNe is still missing, and often objects classiﬁed as SNIIn turn out to be normal when they undergo closer scrutiny (e.g., SN1989C [120]). A remarkable SNIIn is the recent SN1998S. Contrary to most other SNIIn, the spectrum evolved rapidly and seems to be the result of the interaction between 10 Turatto Fig. 4. Spectra of SN1990aj, a SNIb/c with exceptionally strong Fe lines at late epochs, and SN2000er, a bright, fast declining SN with evidence of narrow He I lines in the spectra at maximum. the supernova and a two-component progenitor wind [40]. Polarimetric studies indicate signiﬁcant asphericity for its continuum-scattering environment [73]. The early spectra are well modeled by lines arising primarily in the circumstellar region while later spectra are dominated by the supernova ejecta [72]. 6 SNe and GRBs Other chapters in this volume discuss the association of SN1998bw with GRB980425 and the possibility that at least some GRBs originate from SN explosions. In addition to its stringent spatial and temporal association to GRB980425 [55,67], SN1998bw was peculiar in many respects. The spectrum at early phases was unprecedented and led to diﬀerent classiﬁcations (Ib [106] or peculiar Ic [46,95]). SN1998bw was as bright as an SNIa and displayed expansion velocities as high as 3 × 104 km s−1, suggesting that it was the result of an extremely energetic explosion (> 1052 erg), even if diﬀerent degrees of asymmetry and beaming allow for a broad range of values [65,67,139]. Its very powerful radio emission has been interpreted as due to the presence of a mildly relativistic blast wave interacting with a clumpy, structured CSM deriving from a complex mass-loss history (see the chapter by Weiler et al. in this volume and [133]). The complete dataset of optical and IR observations spanning over one year after the explosion has recently appeared [96]. The analysis of the late time spectra [84] seems to conﬁrm that the explosion was asymmetric as suggested by polarimetry Classiﬁcation of Supernovae 11 [65]. The presence of underlying SNe similar to SN1998bw has been invoked to explain the anomalous rebrightening in light curves of other GRB afterglows at high redshift [19,103]. Other known SNe, SN1997ef [57] and SN1998ey [56], bear some spectroscopic resemblance to SN1998bw. In particular, SN1997ef was possibly associated with GRB971115 [131] and, although it was fainter than SN1998bw, its kinetic energy was close to that of SN1998bw [83]. The case of the bright SNIc 1992ar [37], which occurred at about two σ from the position of GRB920616 [139], is also very interesting. Additional SNe possibly associated with GRBs are SN1997cy, (GRB970514 [59,139]), observationally classiﬁed as SNIIn and possibly the brightest SN ever observed [123], and its twin SN1999E [26] (GRB980910 [118]). As in the case of the type IIn SN1988Z, they show evidence for strong ejecta-CSM interaction. Explosion energies as high as 3 × 1052 erg are required to reproduce the light curves [123]. To denote these particularly energetic objects, the term “hypernova” [67] has been used, although its meaning is not well deﬁned or universally accepted. 7 Peculiar Supernovae Several objects do not ﬁt the schema described above. In many cases they are probably core collapse SNe exploding in unusual conﬁgurations and/or condi- tions, even if the presence of other explosion mechanisms cannot be ruled out. For instance, SN1993R [45] (and possibly SN1990aj, see, e.g., Fig. 4), showed hybrid spectral features of type Ia and Ib/c at late epochs. This has been in- terpreted as the explosion of a SNIb/c with overproduction of 56Ni or with the slow deﬂagration of a white dwarf. The recent SN2000er was also classiﬁed as peculiar [33,80]. The scanty observa- tions available show a broad maximum at MV = −19 followed by a rapid decline of 5 mag in 50 days. The spectrum shows (see, e.g., Fig. 4) a strong continuum with a drop at wavelengths shorter than 4000 ˚A, possibly due to the presence of metals. Narrow lines of He I with P-Cygni proﬁles are visible, indicating the presence of gas with expansion velocity ∼ 900 km s−1 as well as several other lines possibly due to FeII, FeIII and SiIII [21]. It might be a core collapse SN which lost its He envelope shortly before the explosion. A well studied peculiar object is SN1961V, Zwicky’s Type V, which was probably not a genuine SN because the exploding star survived the giant eruption [48]. Similar objects might be SNe 1954J, 1999bw, and the faint SN1997bs for which an extremely luminous supergiant precursor has been identiﬁed [128]. 8 Conclusions The taxonomy of supernovae is a subject which is still evolving. The experience of the last years has shown that the diversity of SNe increases with our ability 12 Turatto to detect, study, and understand them. Even though distant SNe are disclosing new frontiers in observational cosmology, much is still to be learned from nearby objects. Indeed, when we have the chance to apply new observational techniques or to obtain high signal-to-noise observations of nearby objects, new features and phenomena are revealed. Major progress in understanding supernovae can be expected if coordinated eﬀorts involving several teams with wide ranging expertise and access to diﬀerent observational facilities are established. But SN occurrences are unpredictable: in order to really understand them, we would need their cooperation.
