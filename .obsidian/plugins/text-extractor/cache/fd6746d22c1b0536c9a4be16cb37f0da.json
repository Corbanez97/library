Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Preface As we enter the twenty-first century, techniques borrowed from equilibrium and non‐equilibrium statistical physics have become widely applied to disciplines never imagined by their founders. Statistical physics is turning into an essential discipline and a fundamental framework for understanding and making quantitative predictions on diverse phenomena involving a large number of interacting degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom may represent fundamental particles, such as electrons or quarks, or neurons carrying information through synapses, or even speculative agents trading in a competitive financial market. This holistic precept, that the whole is not necessarily equal to the sum of its parts, finds in statistical physics its most beloved tool. Phase transitions and critical phenomena have consistently been among the principal subjects of active studies in statistical physics. The simple act of transforming one state of matter or phase into another, for instance by changing the temperature, has always captivated the curious mind. In that way, one can convert an almost uninteresting state of matter into a superconducting material with tremendous implications and applications. The Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), which is currently exploring the nature of fundamental interactions at high energies, relies on the use of superconducting magnets, electromagnets built out of coils of superconducting niobium-tin wire cooled by liquid helium. Those magnets not only consume less power but most importantly can achieve an order of magnitude stronger fields than ordinary magnets, a fact that is crucial to reach such high energies.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 The unusual set of physical properties known today as critical phenomena were discovered and apparently first reported in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique (1822–1823) by the Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour. He performed experiments on liquids (water, alcohol, and ether) sealed in a glass cell under pressure, and observed the remarkable fact that above a certain temperature, that itself depends on the particular substance, the surface tension between the liquid and vapor disappeared, thus discovering what is known today as the supercritical fluid phase. Trying to prove that beyond a certain temperature the liquid gasifies regardless of pressure, he also noticed that near particular pressure and temperature values something unusual happened. In the neighborhood of this point, known as the critical point, the liquid becomes increasingly milky, indicating that visible light is being strongly scattered. The term critical point was coined later in 1869 by Thomas Andrews who observed that carbon dioxide at 31 degrees Celsius and 73 atmospheres pressure displayed the phenomenon of critical opalescence, that turbid and milky state previously observed by Cagniard de la Tour in other substances. The underlying universality of critical phenomena escaped the attention of their founders. It was Pierre Curie around 1895 who realized the similarity between the critical behaviors of a liquid—gas phase (p. vii ) transition and that of the ferromagnetic transition in iron. The formal connection and derived analogies between unrelated physical materials behaving in a similar, universal, way near a continuous phase transition constitutes one of the landmarks of critical phenomena. Since the discovery of the renormalization group method in the early 1970s, the realm of applications of the concepts of scale invariance and criticality has pervaded several fields in the natural and social sciences. Thus, in perspective, it is of no surprise that these concepts, and the methods used to study them, can be applied to disciplines as diverse as the ones indicated in our introductory paragraph. This book provides an introductory account of the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena. The basic knowledge of the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena is now recognized to be indispensable for students and researchers from many fields of physics and related disciplines. The book has been written having in mind an advanced undergraduate or graduate student in science or mathematics. It has been assumed that the reader has finished introductory courses of statistical mechanics in addition to elementary courses in calculus, Fourier analysis, and probability theory. Very basic undergraduate knowledge of quantum mechanics is required to understand the very few extensions of the classical theory.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 so elementary, concepts have been our guiding principle. We preferred this style of presentation to what is sometimes known as rigorous, where at the expense of making the argument so sharp one loses track of the main idea. One of our goals in writing this book is to provide the mathematical tools necessary for students to compute properties of critical systems in diverse contexts and disciplines, such as biophysics or complex systems. Almost all parts are written in a self‐contained manner and all new concepts and calculations are explained in much detail without assuming prior knowledge of phase transitions and critical phenomena. We have avoided historical presentations of various topics allowing us to present compact derivations of the concepts without hiding details. For example, it is typical to first introduce the scaling hypothesis and then the renormalization group method as a way of justifying that hypothesis. Rather, we preferred to derive the scaling laws directly once the concept of a renormalization transformation is introduced, which, in our opinion, is a more natural and pedagogical way of presenting the material. Another of the goals of this book is to prepare the reader to start reading more advanced books and research papers, in which basic accounts of common knowledge are often omitted and consequently beginners are trapped in the jungle of undefined jargon and complicated manipulations. Serious attempts have been directed toward a self‐ contained modular approach so that the reader does not have to refer to other sources for supplementary information. Accordingly, most of the concepts and calculations are described in detail, sometimes with additional/auxiliary descriptions given in appendices and exercises. It is, of course, impossible to cover all of the topics related to phase transitions and critical phenomena in a single volume of this introductory nature. One main omission is the general subject of quantum phase transitions, which happen at zero temperature as a result of changes in the parameters of the Hamiltonian representing the physical system. Although by itself a topic for a second volume, we have explained a few extensions of classical concepts to the quantum realm when (p. viii ) appropriate and not in danger of jeopardizing the main ideas. Most of these extensions are written in the appendices. The bibliography at the end of the book will guide the reader to other topics not covered in this book and also to more advanced references. A number of important concepts and methods have been developed, such as mean‐ field theory, scaling theory, the renormalization group method, exact solutions, series expansions, and Monte Carlo simulations, most of Page 4 of 5 Preface PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 which have turned out to be valuable tools not only in statistical physics but also in other fields of physics. The present book also contains pedagogical presentations of statistical field theory methods, including a chapter on conformal field theory, random systems, percolation, the important use of dualities, and various modern developments hard to find in a single textbook on phase transitions. Moreover, as mentioned above, a series of appendices expand and clarify several issues not developed in the main text. It has been done in this way to avoid getting stuck in details and thereby losing the main flow of ideas. We would like to invite the reader, however, to seriously explore those appendices in a second reading since they are very useful to understand the depth and extensions of a particular topic. In the first half of this book, standard topics such as mean‐field theory, the renor-malization group, and statistical field theory methods are explained. Then, slightly more advanced, but commonly encountered, concepts and methods follow, including the conformal field theory, the Kosterlitz—Thouless transition, effects of randomness, exact solutions, duality, and numerical techniques. Special emphasis has been placed on providing a physically intuitive description, sometimes with certain sacrifice of mathematical rigor, except in the chapters that discuss exact solutions and duality. The first five chapters are very basic and quintessential, followed by several chapters that can be read independently of each other, provided that the first five chapters have been finished. The important role played by symmetry and topology in understanding the competition between phases and the resulting emergent collective behavior, giving rise to rigidity and soft elementary excitations, is stressed throughout the book. Most importantly, in accordance with Sophocles' advice,1 exercises are presented as the topics develop with solutions found at the end of the book, thus giving the text a self‐learning character. It is strongly recommended that the reader solves (or at least tries to solve) the exercises as one proceeds in reading, since they often contain vital information to understand the logic developed in the main text. The book reflects lectures given by the authors at their Universities to graduate students on the same topics and is thus classroom tested for its usefulness for beginners to this field. Students attending those courses contributed significantly to the improvement of presentation and material selection and the authors are very grateful to them. We would like to express our special thanks to Matthew Dean Jones and Zsolt Bertalan for proofreading and providing insightful remarks.

(p. ix ) Following the convention of many textbooks, we did not directly refer to original research papers for almost all topics in this book. However, we don't mean to claim priority for the materials presented. On the contrary, virtually almost all concepts, methods, and conclusions are well‐established, standard ones. The book simply reflects the authors' interpretation of what constitutes a concise, consistent, coherent, and clear manner of presenting a wide range of topics. Correspondingly, we tried to avoid attributing each result to a specific person, except for a limited number of very common names including (but not limited to) the Ising model, Heisenberg model, Landau theory, Virasoro algebra, Kosterlitz—Thouless transition, Sherrington — Kirkpatrick model, and Lee—Yang zeros. The reader is referred to the bibliography at the end of the book for more detailed sources of information on the original references. We, nevertheless, would like to express our sincere apologies to those who contributed to the developments of the field for leaving out their names, with the expectation that our approach is understood and accepted. We hope this book will help anyone interested in this fascinating subject and, moreover, inspire young scientists to continue developing this profound and far‐ reaching field of science.2 Hidetoshi Nishimori and Gerardo Ortiz Tokyo and Bloomington March 2010 (p. x ) Contents Preface Phase transitions and critical phenomena Mean-field theories Renormalization group and scaling Implementation of the renormalization group Statistical field theory Conformal field theory Kosterlitz- Thouless transition Random systems Exact solutions and related topics Duality Numerical methods For further reading Appendix A Appendix B Index Page 1 of 20 Phase transitions and critical phenomena PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Especially important is the concept of order parameter, a quantity that measures the degree of asymmetry in the broken symmetry phase. Intuitive accounts are given to the concepts of coarse-graining, and scale and renormalization group transformations, which are powerful, systematic tools to analyze critical behaviour of macroscopic systems. Also explained are several spin and lattice gas model systems, on the basis of which phase transitions and critical phenomena will be studied.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 1.1 Phase and phase diagram We are surrounded by a number of substances in different states. A phase is a state of matter in which the macroscopic physical properties of the substance are uniform on a macroscopic length scale, e.g. 1 mm. Familiar examples are ice, liquid water, and water vapor, each of which is a phase of water as a collection of macroscopic numbers of H2O molecules. Roughly speaking, we call the length scale that we encounter in our daily life the macroscopic scale, which is to be contrasted with the microscopic scale as the standard of length in the atomic world. The goal of statistical mechanics is to elucidate physical phenomena occurring on the macroscopic scale as a result of the interactions among microscopic constituents. A phase is characterized by a thermodynamic function, typically the free energy. A thermodynamic function is a function of a few macroscopic parameters such as the temperature and the pressure. Thus, the phase of a macroscopic substance is determined by the values of these parameters. A phase diagram is a graph with those parameters as the axes, on which the phase is specified for each point. An example of a phase diagram is given in Fig. 1.1. A typical phase diagram has several specific features including phase boundaries, a critical point (point C in Fig. 1.1), and a triple point (point TP). A phase boundary separates different phases. A change in parameters such as the temperature across a phase boundary causes a sudden change in the phase of a substance. For example, a solid phase changes into a liquid phase at the melting temperature. This is a phase transition. A phase boundary sometimes disappears at a critical point, where the two phases become indistinguishable and the substance shows anomalous behavior. The theory of critical phenomena explains this anomalous behavior. Page 3 of 20 Phase transitions and critical phenomena PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 1.1 Typical phase diagram. The phase of a substance is determined by the values of the control parameters such as temperature T and pressure p. C denotes the critical point and TP stands for the triple point. Three different phases coexist at the triple point. Consider the example of water. Suppose that we confine some amount of water and ice in a container, seal it, and (p. 2 ) evacuate the remaining air by using a vacuum pump. Then, the space above water and ice will be filled by vapor, realizing the triple point where ice, water and vapor coexist. The temperature and pressure of the triple point of water are T = 273.16 K and p = 0.61 kPa, respectively. A phase can be characterized by various physical quantities. Especially important is the order parameter, which measures how microscopic elements constituting the macroscopic phase are ordered or in a similar state. As detailed in the following chapters, the order parameter is associated with the breaking of a symmetry of the system under consideration. The order parameter measures the degree of asymmetry in the broken symmetry phase (which is the ordered phase), i.e. it is non-zero in the ordered phase (lower-symmetry state) and vanishes in the disordered phase (symmetric phase). In magnetic materials, for example, magnetization is a characteristic order para meter. Magnetization is the strength of a magnet, roughly speaking. The alignment of microscopic electronic spins gives rise to macroscopic magnetism. The symmetry that spontaneously gets broken is associated with the rotation of the spins. In solids, atoms or molecules occupy periodic positions. In this case, the spatial periodicity of molecules/atoms is the order parameter. A more abstract example is the quantum-mechanical phase of superconductors. A superconductor is characterized by a macroscopic quantum-mechanical wave function. The phenomenon of supercon ductivity is observed when the phase of this wave function has a constant value in a macroscopically extended region. It is not always an easy task to determine the order parameter. Indeed, some phases do not even have a local order parameter to characterize them. Moreover, some order parameters couple to external physical probes (e.g. the magnetization couples to an externally applied magnetic field), while others do not (e.g. the phase of the macroscopic wave function, which is the superconducting order parameter, does not couple to any physical external probe).

(a) and (b) are first-order transitions, and (c) and (d) are second order. A phase transition is a phenomenon in which a drastic change between thermodynamic phases occurs as the system parameters such as the temperature and pressure are (p. 3 ) varied. A familiar example is the melting of ice at 0°C near 1 atm. The char acterization of a phase transition as a drastic change of macroscopic properties is described theoretically as the emergence of singularities (non-analyticities) in functions representing physical quantities. As shown in Fig. 1.2, quantities such as the entropy S, the volume V and the specific heat C show such singularities as a discontinuity (jump), a cusp or a divergence. An example is the melting of ice, in which latent heat must be supplied to the system and consequently the entropy jumps as illustrated in Fig. 1.2(a). When water boils and changes to vapor, the volume changes discontinuously. From a physics standpoint the reason behind the occurrence of a phase transition is the competition between the (internal) energy E and the entropy S of the system, which together determine its free energy F = E − TS. While the first term (E) favors order, the second (S) privileges disorder, and depending on the value of the external parameters (such as T), one of the two terms dominates.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 According to the conventional classification, phase transitions are roughly divided into two types by the degree of singularity in physical quantities. When the first-order derivative of the free energy F shows a discontinuity, the transition is of first order. The transition is called continuous if the second- or higher-order derivatives of the free energy show a discontinuity or a divergence. It is also common to name phase transitions by the order of the derivative that first shows a discontinuity or divergence, e.g. it is called second order if it is the second-order derivative of the free energy that first displays the discontinuity or divergence. For instance, the transition of ice to (p. 4 ) water accompanies latent heat and consequently a jump in entropy (ΔS # 0). Since the entropy is the derivative of the free energy S = − (∂F/∂T)V, such a transition is of first order. A transition with continuous entropy but a discontinuity in the specific heat C, which is the derivative of the entropy is of second order (Figs. 1.2(c) and (d)). In many second- order transitions, the specific heat diverges at the transition temperature. Examples include the λ transition, i.e. the superfluid transition in liquid helium 4, and the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in magnetic materials. A particularly interesting and common transition in systems of low space dimensionality is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition (see Chapter 7), where all derivatives of the free energy are continuous, nonetheless, the free energy has a singularity, known in mathematics as an essential singularity. Notice that from the statistical mechanics viewpoint, thermodynamics arises from the free energy, which is determined by the partition function Z, Page 6 of 20 Phase transitions and critical phenomena PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 panel (a) correspond to the changes in parameters shown in panels (b) and (c), respectively. A material may show both first- and second-order transitions depending on the conditions. Figure 1.3(a) illustrates the phase diagram of a magnetic material placed in an external magnetic field h. If the temperature T is lower than some T c (critical temperature, critical point, criticality, transition point), the sign of the magnetization m jumps from minus to plus as the external magnetic field h is scanned from the negative direction to the positive direction as realized by the path (b) of Fig. 1.3(a), thus a first-order transition. For negative h, the spins in the magnetic material align with that negative direction on the macroscopic scale. They suddenly change the direction as the (p. 5 ) external field becomes positive.1 Thus, for T # T c, a finite magnetization m remains even after we take the zero-field limit h → 0+ as depicted in Fig. 1.3(b). The sign is of course negative, m # 0, when h → 0−. This is called spontaneous magnetization, a typical example of an order parameter. When the temperature is high, T # T c, the magnetization changes smoothly at h = 0 without any singularities. On the other hand, if we keep the external magnetic field infinitesimally small, h = 0+, and lower the temperature across T c, then the spontaneous magnetization changes continuously from 0 to a positive value (Fig. 1.3(c)), thus defining a second- order transition. 1.3 Critical phenomena Continuous phase transitions are often synonymous with critical phenomena, i.e. anomalous phenomena that appear around the critical point (C in Fig. 1.1) where two or more phases become indistinguishable. The main goal of the present book is to present the basic theory to understand critical phenomena. Let us explain the idea of critical phenomena observed in magnetic materials. Suppose that we decrease the temperature T toward the critical temperature (critical point) T c from above as in Fig. 1.3(c). The magnetization m keeps its vanishing value throughout this process. Nevertheless, as a precursor to finite spontaneous magnetization m # 0, h → 0+ below T c, the magnetization increases very rapidly if we apply a small but finite external magnetic field h at temperatures slightly above the critical temperature. Thus, according to the definition of magnetic susceptibility χ Page 7 of 20 Phase transitions and critical phenomena PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 (1.2) this χ assumes a very large value near the critical temperature T c (Fig. 1.4). The magnetization is proportional to the external field m ∝ h for T # T c. When the temperature is adjusted to be exactly at the critical point (T = T c), the magnetization grows more rapidly as a function of the external field, m ∝ h 1/δ (1/δ # 1). If we define the magnetic susceptibility as the first- order coefficient of h as in eqn (1.2), then the susceptibility at the critical point behaves as χ ≈ m/h ∝ h 1/δ−1 and diverges as h → 0. See Fig. 1.4. Spins do not spontaneously align on the macroscopic scale in the high- temperature region T # T c but they, nevertheless, tend to have a similar direction within fairly large regions for T close to T c. These clustered spins respond coherently to the external field, and consequently the magnetization increases very rapidly as the field is applied. The degree of alignment of spins fluctuates significantly in space and time. The singularities in physical quantities reflect these fluctuations. Fig. 1.4 The magnetic susceptibility diverges at the critical point. Essentially, the same phenomena are observed around the liquid-vapor critical point shown in Fig. 1.1. Suppose that we increase the temperature and pressure so that the system stays on the coexistence curve (phase boundary) of liquid and vapor along the curve between TP and C in Fig. 1.1. Since (low-density) vapor and (high-density) liquid become indistinguishable beyond the critical point, there exist fairly large regions in the liquid where the density is significantly lower than the average at temperatures sufficiently close to (but below) the critical temperature. Similarly (p. 6 ) large clusters of high density will show up in the vapor. These phenomena may be described as fluctuations in the density the difference of which between vapor and liquid represents the order parameter.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 scale of such fluctuations ranges from microscopic to quasi-macroscopic near the critical point. Consequently fluctuations of length scales close to the wavelength of visible light exist. Then, there appear white cloud-like regions in the transparent liquid/vapor due to the reflection of light from such clusters. This phenomenon is termed critical opalescence. One of the physical quantities that show a singularity in such a case is the variance of density per unit volume, which diverges at the critical temperature. The degree of singularity or divergence of physical quantities near the critical point is described by critical exponents or critical indices (α, α′, β, γ, γ′, δ, η, ν, …). Experiments show that physical quantities generally have power-law singularities as functions of the difference between the control parameters (such as temperature) and their critical values. Let us denote this difference by t and take it as a dimensionless quantity. For example, t = (T − T c)/T c, where T c is the critical temperature.

Figures 1.5, 1.8 and 1.9 show such emergence of fluctuations in the two-dimensional (d = 2) ferromagnetic Ising model (see Section 1.5) simulated by the Monte Carlo method to be detailed in Chapter 11. Let us first have a look at Fig. 1.5(a) that shows the state of the system at a temperature slightly below the critical point, T = 0.995T c. The two- dimensional Ising model with a linear size 486 was simulated, and a typical spin configuration is shown here with up spins in black and down spins in white. No external field h is applied. Most spins are in the up state and the system is magnetically ordered. Up spins are connected from one edge of the square to the opposite edge, whereas down spins exist only in isolated islands. Most of these islands have a length scale of a few millimeters in the (p. 8 ) present printed scale (of the order of 10 spins in the number of sites).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 1.7 The renormalization group transformation changes the effective temperature. If the initial temperature is below the critical point, the effective temperature decreases, whereas it increases when the initial value is above the critical temperature. The critical point corresponds to the (unstable) fixed point of the transformation. Now, let us apply a block-spin transformation to the configuration of Fig. 1.5(a). The result is depicted in Fig. 1.5(b). The block-spin transformation in this example consists of replacing the neighboring 3 × 3 = 9 spins by a single spin according to the majority rule illustrated in Fig. 1.6. Figure 1.5(b) can be regarded as a coarse-grained version of 1.5(a) with the details of very short length scales washed out. The dominance of black states is more prominent in (b) than in (a). The length scale is reduced to 1/3 of the original one and, correspondingly, the linear size of typical white regions (correlation length) is reduced by the same factor. Figure 1.5(b) should therefore be expanded (rescaled) by the factor 3 if we are to restore the original scale. (p. 9 ) Repeated applications of block-spin transformation to (b) yield (c) and then (d). These latter figures (c) and (d) are almost uniformly black. This is a consequence of consecutive eliminations of fluctuations of short length scales (i.e. white islands in the black sea) in order to focus our attention to the phenomenon of long length scales. This process allows us to extract the essential features of the macroscopic system near the critical point. This is the physical picture behind the renormalization group. A block- spin transformation is a step to realize the idea of a renormalization group transformation, which consists of elimination of short-length fluctuations (coarse graining) and rescaling.2 The latter process of rescaling in the example of Fig. 1.5 is just to expand (b) by the factor 3 and reproduce the original scale of (a). The all-black state corresponds to the maximum magnetization, which is physically realized at zero temperature. We may thus understand that the renormalization group gradually lowers the effective temperature to eventually reduce the system to the zero-temperature state of Fig. 1.5(d), see Fig. 1.7.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 1.8 Change of spin configurations by renormalization group transformations for a system at temperature T = T c. If we apply the same manipulations to the system exactly at the critical point T = T c, we obtain Fig. 1.8. The external field is zero in this case too. The initial state (a) may give the reader an impression that the black state is slightly dominant over the white state (or vice versa). However, when we apply the renormalization steps as in (b), (c), (d), the system does not seem to approach an overwhelmingly black (or white) state. The physical reason behind this behavior is that there exist fluctuations (black and white islands) of all length scales at the critical point, from microscopic to macroscopic scales, which makes it impossible to eliminate short-length fluctuations to reduce the system to essentially the zero-temperature or infinite-temperature states. The system remains unchanged by the renormalization group. In fact, white islands of small to large length scales coexist in Fig. 1.8(a) and we cannot identify a typical length scale. For temperatures lower than the critical one, T # T c, as in Fig. 1.5, fluctuations have a typical length scale ξ, and hence a few renormalization steps are sufficient to eliminate these short-length behaviors. A critical region is a fluctuation-dominated regime of the system. Exactly at the critical point, the system has an essentially different property, that of the absence of a typical length scale. This fact may be rephrased by stating that the effective temperature does not change by a renormalization group transformation if the system is at the critical point. The critical point corresponds to a fixed point of the renormalization group transformation. (p. 10 ) The final example of block-spin transformation is for a temperature higher than the critical point T = 1.05T c.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 change the system state to a completely random one. The situation in (c) and (d) resembles the high-temperature limit of the system where spins rapidly change their states due to strong thermal agitation. In this sense, the renormalization-group transformation reveals that the system above the critical point has essentially the same properties as the system in the high- temperature limit. The correlation length is of the order of a few millimeters to a centimeter in (a), which is reduced to the very short distance between neighboring (block) spins in (c) and (d). Fig. 1.9 Spin configuration at T = 1.05T c and its block-spin transformations. A general strategy to study critical phenomena is, as suggested by the examples mentioned above, to write a set of renormalization group equations, which describe how parameters such as the temperature change as the degree of coarse graining and rescaling is increased, and to analyze its solution around the (critical) fixed point. A fixed point is a point in the parameter space, to which corresponds a state (or fixed-point Hamiltonian) invariant under a renormalization group transformation. It has an associated correlation length ξ that is either infinity (at a critical fixed point) or zero (at a trivial fixed point in the high- or low-temperature limit, for example). These ideas are formulated in detail in later chapters. (p. 11 ) The important concept of universality emerges from the idea of renormalization group that eliminates inessential short-range details and emphasizes increasingly macroscopic viewpoints. More precisely, an important consequence of universality is that quantities that describe the essential features of critical phenomena, typically the critical exponents, do not depend on the system details but are specified only by a few basic factors such as the symmetry of the system, range of the interactions (i.e. Page 14 of 20 Phase transitions and critical phenomena PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 short or long range), and its spatial dimensionality (more precisely, the connectivity of its elementary degrees of freedom, e.g. spins in the Ising model, when the system is defined on a lattice). For example, two apparently different critical phenomena share the same critical exponents, one in the Ising model and the other in a simple liquid, as long as both are in three dimensions. These two distinct physical systems are said to belong to the same universality class. It is surprising that a model of magnetism shows essentially the same critical behavior as one for the liquid. The physical reason behind this behavior is that many characteristics of the system3 gradually recede as the renormalization-group transformation proceeds and eventually only the essential factors, the spatial dimensionality and the symmetry of the system, survive. (p. 12 ) The symmetry in the example of the Ising model in the absence of an external field is that all the microscopic ingredients (Ising spins) can be transformed into minus its values, S i → −S i (∀i), with the Hamiltonian kept invariant. This is a global transformation that is mathematically represented by the group ℤ2, which consists of two elements {1, −1} with the usual rule of multiplication. Correspondingly the order parameter is a scalar quantity the number of components being just one. These features are shared by the liquid-vapor transition in simple liquids. Strong evidence to support such a viewpoint is provided by the experimental fact that the critical exponents of simple liquids agree with those for single- component magnets. Additional support for this view will be given from the explicit formulation of the renormalization group method in later chapters. Another quantity that shows universality in addition to the critical exponents, is the ratio of critical amplitudes, the coefficient A in eqn (1.10), on the high-temperature (t # 0) and low-temperature (t # 0) sides of the phase transition. There are, of course, many properties that are non-universal, the critical temperature itself being a relevant example that depends on the microscopic details of the model. 1.5 Ising model and related systems It is not necessary to construct and study a precise model Hamiltonian, which reflects the details of a real material of interest, in order to understand the critical phenomena shown by the material. Universality allows us to simplify the model to a very basic one, eliminating all inessential characteristics, if we are interested in the values of universal quantities such as the critical exponents. This fact provides the useful strategy that consists of adopting Page 15 of 20 Phase transitions and critical phenomena PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Mean‐field theories Hidetoshi Nishimori, Gerardo Ortiz Abstract and Keywords The present chapter explains the mean-field approximation, the Landau theory, the infinite-range model, and the Bethe approximation, and shows that all these (mean-field) theories are essentially equivalent to each other. The Landau theory is a phenomenological approach that uses the concept of symmetry and the order parameter, a measure of the breaking of that symmetry, as fundamental collective degrees of freedom. Also described are the Landau theory of tricritical behaviour, correlation functions, the limit of applicability of the mean-field theory, known as the Ginzburg criterion, and dynamic critical phenomena. Mean-field theories yield the exact critical exponents for dimensions larger than the upper critical dimension, and their solutions provide a reasonable starting point for more advanced methods including the renormalization group. Keywords:   Landau theory, order parameter, critical exponents, correlation functions, Ginzburg criterion, upper critical dimension, dynamic critical phenomena The basic strategy of theoretical studies of phase transitions and critical phenomena is to solve models, such as the ones described in the last section of Chapter 1, according to the prescription of statistical mechanics. This program is actually quite hard to follow closely. As an example, the total number of states for the N‐spin Ising model is 2N, since each spin may take one of the two values, 1 and −1. This exponential number increases very rapidly with N, and it soon becomes impossible to calculate the partition function exactly in a straightforward manner as N reaches a moderate value. For instance, N = 10 yields 2N = 1024, and as N increases to N = Page 2 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

In some limited cases we may derive exact solutions by ingenious methods, as described in Chapter 9. However, in general, we have to resort to approximate methods to understand the essential features of the physical phenomena under consideration. One of the most common and important approximations is called mean‐field. In the present chapter we explain the mean‐field approximation, the Landau theory, the infinite‐range model, and the Bethe approximation, and show that all these (mean‐field) theories are essentially equivalent to each other. Also described are the Landau theory of tricritical behavior, correlation functions, the limit of applicability of the mean‐field theory, and dynamic critical phenomena. These mean‐field solutions provide a reasonable starting point for more advanced methods including the renormalization group. 2.1 Mean‐field approximation Let us first explain the mean‐field approximation for the Ising model. The basic strategy is to focus our attention on a single spin and replace the neighboring spins by their averages, as illustrated in Fig. 2.1. Then, the problem reduces to a single‐variable case, and the number of degrees of freedom appearing in the computation of the partition function is drastically reduced from 2N to 2. The problem of many interacting particles is replaced by a non‐interacting one, which greatly facilitates the theoretical treatment. As will be shown below, this procedure is equivalent to the approximation where one ignores the deviations (fluctuations) from the average value of the spin variables. We explain this latter method since it provides a transparent point of view on the essence of the mean‐field approximation. Fig. 2.1 In the mean‐field approximation spin variables surrounding a given spin are replaced by their average values (shown in gray circles). Let us separate the Ising spin variable S i into its thermal average m = #S i# and the deviation (fluctuation1) from the average δS i = S i − #S i# in the Ising model (p. 17 ) Page 3 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

It is not difficult, if necessary, to recover the formulas explicitly including k B by dimensional analysis. Fig. 2.3 (a) Graphical solution of the equation of state for the mean‐field approximation of the Ising model. When βJz # 1, the line y = m and the curve y = tanh βJzm cross at two points with m = 0 as indicated by black dots. (b) The solution m(T) marked by the black dot in (a) is depicted as a function of T. Only the solution with m # 0 is shown here. Equation (2.6) determines m as a function of the external parameters h and β and is also called the (mean‐field) equation of state. It is not possible to explicitly (p. 19 ) solve eqn (2.6) for m, but we may develop the following argument for the behavior of the solution by using a graphical representation of the left‐ and right‐hand sides. Let us assume h = 0 for simplicity. As shown in Fig. 2.3(a), the slope of the right‐ hand side tanh(βJmz) at the origin is larger than 1 when βJz # 1 and the equation of state has non‐vanishing solutions. This means that the system has a finite spontaneous magnetization, the non‐ vanishing magnetization that exists in the limit of a vanishing external field h —# 0, below the critical point T c = Jz. Figure 2.3(b) represents this situation. The sign of m is determined by whether h approaches 0 from above (h = 0+) or below (h = 0−). Only the solution m # 0 is shown in Fig. 2.3(b), but there exists a corresponding negative solution with the same absolute value. The absolute value of the solution m ≠ 0 increases as the temperature decreases. In this way, we have reached a qualitative understanding of Fig. 1.3(c) from a mean‐field perspective. The mean‐field approximation presented in this section represents one possible way to realize a mean‐field theory.

In our particular example of the Ising model, we reduced 2N to 2. However, we could have applied the same type of approximation to a cluster of N c spins instead of a single spin, with a reduction from 2N to 2N c. An example of this latter case is the Bethe (or Bethe‐Peierls) approximation, to be discussed in Section 2.8. exercise 2.1 Consider the model Hamiltonian of eqn (2.1) for a collection of spins of magnitude S with S i = −S, −S + 1, …, S ‐ 1, S.

As one sees in eqn (1.5), the critical exponent β describes how the magnetization m vanishes as the (p. 20 ) temperature increases toward the critical point in the absence of an external field h. Since we are interested in the region where m is very small, it is legitimate to expand the right‐hand side of eqn (2.6) around m = 0.

These considerations lead us to the temperature (p. 21 ) dependence of the specific heat as depicted in Fig. 2.4 with a jump at T c. This jump is described by the exponent α = 0 because it implies C ∝ ǀT ‐ T cǀ0, that is, the specific heat approaches a finite constant as the temperature reaches the critical value, which is indeed the case both above and below T c as shown above. This also confirms that α = α′(= 0). exercise 2.3 Determine the average energy per spin and specific heat (h = 0) of the Ising model in the mean‐field approximation. To find the value of the critical exponent δ that describes the magnetic‐field dependence of the magnetization exactly at T = T c, it is useful to expand the equation of state under the assumption that both m and h are small (but not necessarily of the same order), thus providing the h dependence of m.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 γ 1 δ 3 A closer look at the above‐mentioned derivation of critical exponents reveals that universality is realized even within the mean‐field approximation since the values of the critical exponents depend just on some symmetry properties and not on other details of the system. For example, the result β = ½ emerges from the fact that the right‐hand side of eqn (2.7) is composed of the first‐ and third‐order terms of m: By dividing both sides of this equation by m, we reduce m 3 in the second term of the right‐ hand side to m 2 and the left‐hand side to a constant. Then, the magnetization behaves as the square root of the temperature difference. This means that the coefficient 1/3 of the second term of the right‐hand side of eqn (2.7) has no influence on the critical exponent. Only the negative sign matters. We further find that the explicit form as a hyperbolic tangent of the right‐ hand side of the equation of state (2.6) does not come into play, but the only ingredient that affects the result is that tanh(βJmz) is an odd function of m with a negative coefficient in the third order. A similar comment applies to the critical exponent γ. The only requirement to reproduce γ = 1 is that the right‐hand side of the equation of state is an odd function with a positive coefficient in the first order of the expansion. A different value of this positive coefficient leads to a different value of the critical point with the same critical exponent. We notice here the non‐universality of the value of the critical point. exercise 2.4 Let us study the Heisenberg model by the mean‐ field approximation.

The locations of minima change according to whether the temperature is above the critical point (a), at the critical point (b) or below (c). The Landau theory is a variant of the mean‐field theory, which does not include the elementary degrees of freedom of the statistical model. It is a phenomenological theory in that no microscopic variables, such as the Ising spins, are used and the free energy is written as a function of the magnetization (i.e. the order parameter) from (p. 23 ) symmetry considerations alone. The condition of thermal equilibrium is realized as a minimization of the free energy. Let us first discuss the simple case of h = 0, i.e. no external field. The free energy per microscopic degree of freedom or per unit volume will be written as ƒ and is regarded as a function of magnetization. The magnetization per spin m = #S i# changes its sign, m → −m, if we change the signs of all the spins, S i → −S i, ∀i. In the absence of external field h, the Hamiltonian (2.1) is a bilinear form of the spin variables, and remains invariant under the overall inversion of the sign of the spins. This ℤ2 transformation represents a global symmetry. Consequently, the free energy remains invariant under the same operation. Thus, the free energy ƒ (m) is an even function of the magnetization m. Since we are interested in critical phenomena, the temperature is close to the critical point and the magnetization m assumes a very small value. This would allow us to expand the free energy in even powers of m and retain only the lowest‐order terms. This Landau free‐energy expansion3 (analytic expansion in terms of the order parameter) for the Ising universality class reads Page 11 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 where ƒ0,a and b are constants as functions of m but have temperature dependence. Generally, the Landau free energy is determined by writing all possible scalar invariants in terms of powers and products of the order parameter components. Thus, relevant symmetries of the original microscopic model are preserved at a coarse‐grained level of description. See Section 5.5. Thermal equilibrium is realized by minimization of ƒ(m) for a given h (which is 0 for the moment). It is convenient to graphically show the functional form of (p. 24 ) eqn (2.16) to identify the locations of minima. We first notice that b should be positive. Otherwise, the free energy f(m) decreases indefinitely as ǀmǀ increases, which implies an instability. The m dependence of ƒ (m) is illustrated in Fig. 2.5 for three possible values of the coefficient a. For a # 0, the minimum is at m = 0 and thus there is no spontaneous magnetization (Fig. 2.5(a)). When a is exactly 0, the Landau expansion (2.16) starts from the fourth order and ƒ (m) is very flat at the origin, Fig. 2.5(b), but still the equilibrium magnetization remains 0. As soon as a becomes negative, two minima emerge away from m = 0 and the absolute value ǀm 0ǀ at these points grows with decreasing a, Fig. 2.5(c). The original Hamiltonian and free energy are symmetric (invariant) under a change of sign of m, but the realized state for a # 0 does not have such a symmetry since only one of the two minima is actually realized in a physical system. In other words, the thermodynamic free energy is invariant under the overall change of the sign of spins (S i → −S i, ∀i) but the realized equilibrium state has no such symmetry. This phenomenon is called spontaneous symmetry breaking. A small external field or the initial condition of time evolution of the system determines which of the two states is actually realized, which is also called ergodicity breaking because only a part of the phase space is reached by the system. This situation is common with the mean‐field approximation explained in Section 2.1. Since the equilibrium position (minimum) of ƒ(m) changes at a = 0, we may identify a = 0 with the critical point T = T c. This observation would allow us to choose an odd power of kt as a, where k is a positive constant and t = (T ‐ T c)/T c is the deviation of the temperature from the critical point normalized by T c, also known as the reduced temperature. The simplest choice is a = kt, for which clearly a # 0 above the critical point and a # 0 below. The temperature dependence of b does not affect the qualitative behavior of the free energy around the critical point or the critical exponents, and we therefore take b as a constant, independent of temperature.

Show that this situation represents a first‐ order transition. Hint: f should be minimized for equilibrium. 2.4 Landau theory of the tricritical point The Landau theory assumes a positive coefficient b for the fourth‐order (quartic) term. Under certain circumstances, however, a negative b describes the system behavior more appropriately. A typical example is the critical behavior around a tricritical point, where three lines of critical points meet. Let us see how the Landau theory is modified when b is negative. As explained already, the Landau expansion to fourth order (2.16) with negative b leads to a thermodynamic instability because the equilibrium value of m is indefinitely large, i.e. unbounded. This suggests that one needs to include a sixth‐order term, Page 16 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 0 remains globally stable. The states with m ≠ 0 have local stability around each local minimum and are called metastable states. Fig. 2.6 For a negative coefficient of the fourth‐order term, b, the Landau free energy describes a first‐order phase transition. (a) 3b 2/16c = a 1 # a # a 0 = b 2/4c, (b) a = a 1, (c) 0 # a # a 1, (d) a # 0. Fig. 2.7 A phase diagram that contains a tricritical point at the origin. The hatched region is the ferromagnetic phase with m ≠ 0. Metastable states appear below the curve a 0. The transition is second order to the right of the origin and it is first order to the left. A further decrease of temperature causes a to be smaller than a 1 = 3b 2/16c, in which case the global minimum shifts from m = 0 to the two symmetrically located states with m ≠ 0. Consequently, the magnetization of the equilibrium state jumps from m = 0 to m ≠ 0, see Fig. 2.6(b). This is a first‐order phase transition. For a # 0 the local stability of the solution m = 0 is lost, Fig. 2.6(d). (p. 28 ) exercise 2.8 Derive the transition point a 1 = 3b 2/16c of the first‐order transition.

If b # 0, metastable states appear at a = a 0, and states with spontaneous Page 17 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 magnetization become globally stable at a = a 1 through a first‐order transition. The point b = 0 is at the border of these two distinct situations, and the origin a = b = 0 is a special point, called a tricritical point. The special point a = b = 0 is called a tricritical point for the following reason. A similar analysis in the presence of an external field reveals the structure of the phase diagram in a three‐dimensional space with an additional axis for h. If we choose the h‐axis perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 2.7, the line of first‐order transitions for b # 0, a = a 1, extends as a plane through the region with h ≠ 0. The first‐order transition line a = a 1 drawn in Fig. 2.7 for h = 0 is a cross‐section of this plane. For values of ǀhǀ larger than a certain value, this plane of first‐order transitions terminates with a line of second‐order transitions along the boundary. No transitions exist beyond this line. This line of second‐order transitions starts at the origin a = b = h = 0 and extends to both regions of h # 0 and h # 0. Hence, these two lines for b # 0 and another line of (p. 29 ) second‐order transitions for b # 0, i.e. a = h = 0, merge at the origin. This observation justifies calling the origin a = b = h = 0 a tricritical point. Critical exponents for the tricritical point are evaluated as follows. If we take the derivative of the free energy with respect to m at b = h = 0, we obtain Page 18 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 experimental realization of these situations is actually difficult because the system is assumed to have very special values of adjustable parameters, as implied by the vanishing of many coefficients. For example, the ordinary critical point is realized by tuning h and T to their critical values, h = 0 and T = T c. The tricritical point of the spin‐1 Ising model needs an additional adjustment of the anisotropy parameter D to its critical value. Higher‐order critical points need more and more tuning of the parameters, making these situations virtually impossible to realize experimentally. 2.5 Infinite‐range model The theory described in Section 2.1 is an approximation to analyze model systems. The infinite‐range model is a very interesting system because it can be solved exactly in the thermodynamic limit and the result coincides with the mean‐field solution. Let us first derive the solution and next show how the mean‐field approximation gives the exact result. The infinite‐range model with Ising spins is defined by the following Hamiltonian, Page 20 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 expected that critical exponents of the infinite‐range model, the mean‐field values, accurately describe the behavior of sufficiently high‐dimensional systems. It will indeed be shown later that the mean‐ field theories give the exact critical exponents for dimensions larger than the upper critical dimension d uc (which is usually d uc = 4). The physical picture is that the number of interacting partners of a spin is large for high‐dimensional cases, which would yield a large ‘force’ to fix the spin under consideration into a specific direction. Such a large force is expected to reduce fluctuations, resulting in reliability of the mean‐field theories in which fluctuations are ignored. 2.6 Variational method The following variational approach provides another viewpoint to understand the physics behind the mean‐field theories. The source of difficulty to perform exact calculations of physical quantities lies in the non‐trivial structure of the probability distribution function P(S 1,…, S n) = e −β H/Z with, for example, the Hamiltonian (2.1), where the degrees of freedom S 1, S 2, …, S N are coupled with each other. It may (p. 33 ) thus be useful to employ an approximation that decouples the distribution function into a product of simpler functions, following the spirit of the mean‐field approximation typically represented by eqn (2.5). The key element here is the decoupling of the distribution function, not the Hamiltonian. We therefore approximate the full distribution by the product of single‐site functions, Page 23 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The variational approach in the previous section provides a good starting point because the results for the free energy (2.48) and the self‐consistent equation (2.49) remain valid just by a sign change of J since we did not use the sign of J in their derivations. We therefore use eqn (2.49) and write m i = m a for i on sublattice A and m i = m B for sublattice B. Since all neighboring sites of i ∈ A belong to sublattice B and vice versa, eqn (2.49) with J → −J is expressed as (p. 35 ) Page 26 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Let us return to ferromagnetic systems and study the Bethe approximation (also called Bethe‐Peierls approximation), a straightforward and useful approach to improve over the mean‐field approximation of Section 2.1. The latter approximation treats exactly the degree of freedom of a single spin and replaces all the other variables by their mean values. In the Bethe approximation, nearest neighbors are treated without approximation and the spins beyond those neighbors are approximated by their average, as illustrated in Fig. 2.10.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 where K c stands for J/T c. This result coincides with the mean‐field value T c = zJ in the limit of large z. For finite z, eqn (2.67) represents an improvement over the mean‐field approximation. For instance, in the case of the two‐ dimensional square lattice with z = 4, the critical points are T c/J = 4, 2.8854 and 2.2692 for the mean‐ field approximation, the Bethe approximation, and the exact solution, respectively. In one dimension, with z = 2, the mean‐field approximation predicts T c/J = 2, whereas the Bethe approximation gives the exact result T c = 0. The effects of fluctuations are better taken into account in the Bethe approximation than in the mean‐field approximation of Section 2.1. Critical exponents remain unchanged from the mean‐field values. To estimate the exponent β, let us expand the right‐hand side of eqn (2.63) in powers of βh 1 in the absence of external field h. We find a linear term, and therefore the spontaneous magnetization is proportional to the effective field h 1. This motivates us to study the temperature dependence of the effective field. Equation (2.66) is suitable for this purpose: The role of m in the mean‐ field relation (2.7) is replaced here by βh 1. Accordingly, using the same argument as in the mean‐field case, we find that βh 1 is proportional to (T c ‐ T)½, and thus the critical exponent β is equal to ½. To investigate the critical exponent α, we notice that the internal energy is finite in the high‐temperature (disordered) region T # T c, in contrast to the mean‐field approximation, since nearest‐neighbor interactions are taken into account explicitly. The corresponding specific heat is finite in qualitative agreement with experiments. In the low‐temperature region the specific heat is also finite, as in the mean‐field case. (p. 39 ) Hence, the value of the specific heat is improved quantitatively over the mean‐field approximation but still remains finite. This implies that the exponent α is unchanged, i.e. α = 0. Similar conclusions are drawn for the other critical exponents γ and δ. exercise 2.11 Calculate γ and δ in the Bethe approximation. It will be sufficient to evaluate γ for T # T c, as the other case T # T c is a little complicated. Write explicitly the expansion (2.66) of the right‐hand side of the self‐consistent equation to first order with an external field h included. The third‐order term will be unnecessary as it will not influence γ in the high‐ temperature region. The result will have the same form as the mean‐field equation (2.9), which allows us to apply the same Page 31 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Another interesting way to understand the Bethe approximation is through the concept of the cavity method. Assume h = 0 for simplicity. The effective field h 1 acting on S 1 in eqn (2.58) may be regarded as the accumulated effect of many spins beyond S 1, represented as dotted lines connected to S 1 in Fig. 2.11, in the absence of interaction between S 0 and S 1 since this last interaction is separately taken into account. Then, the effect of the interaction between S 0 and S 1 onto S 0 is calculated by taking the trace over S 1 as, Page 32 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 ν = 1/2, which implies d uc = 3 for the upper critical dimension according to eqn (2.97). The mean‐field approximation predicts a finite transition temperature for any spatial dimension d including the one‐dimensional case. However, the lower the spatial dimension is, the more unstable ordered states are due to larger fluctuations. It actually happens that there is no finite temperature phase transition, i.e. T c = 0, for d smaller than a threshold value d Ic, the lower critical dimension. For the Ising model the lower critical dimension is d Ic = 1, while the XY and Heisenberg models have d Ic = 2, as will be explained in Chapter 7. 2.11 Dynamic critical phenomena Non‐equilibrium, time‐dependent quantities also show anomalous behavior near the critical point, known as dynamic critical phenomena. This section is an introduction to (p. 47 ) dynamic critical phenomena within the mean‐field perspective. The main physical idea consists of taking the system out of equilibrium, but not very far, and studying how the system relaxes back to equilibrium when it is close to a critical point and the dynamics, bringing the system to equilibrium, is dissipative. Dynamics of phase transitions in some steady state far from equilibrium is beyond the scope of the present section. In this section t stands for time and not for the reduced temperature (T − T c)/T c. 2.11.1 Single degree of freedom As a preparation to developing a mean‐field theory for dynamic critical phenomena, we first study the simple case of a single degree of freedom (e.g. a single particle) moving with energy dissipation, i.e. a model of Brownian motion. Suppose that a particle with instantaneous velocity v is moving in a medium under a friction of strength Γ (dissipative force), and a random time‐ dependent force ζ(t) due to the scattering by other particles in the medium (noise), Page 42 of 48 Mean#field theories PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 applicability of the dynamic mean‐field theory in the present section should be discussed under these additional conditions. Notes: (1) The term fluctuation is used in a few slightly different ways. In the previous chapter a fluctuation meant that, within a spatial region, the degree of freedom takes a different value from that in the surrounding regions. In the present section, the deviation of the value of a very local degree of freedom from the average is called a fluctuation. (2) Not to be confused with the critical exponent β. (3) Note that the Landau free energy ƒ(m) in eqn (2.16), with m a given magnetization, is not the true thermodynamic free energy as a function of T and h, since not all microscopic configurations (giving other values of m) are included. As will be explained in Chapter 5, the Landau theory can be obtained as a saddle‐point approximation of a certain field theory. The value of the approximate equilibrium free energy ƒ (m 0) is obtained by minimization of ƒ (m) with respect to m. Then, thermodynamic properties such as the specific heat are determined by differentiation of ƒ (m 0) with respect to the corresponding parameters. (4) To simplify notation, we use the same symbol m, instead of m 0, for the equilibrium value of magnetization. (5) The threshold of a for the minima to appear, a 0 = b 2 /4c, can be derived from the condition that the minimization equation ∂ f /∂ m = m(a + bm 2 + cm 4) = 0 starts to have non‐vanishing real‐valued solutions. (6) The coordination number z in the infinite‐range model is the number of all spins other than itself, N − 1 ≈ N. (7) Rigorously speaking, the right‐hand side of eqn (2.41) is a stochastic variable, whereas the left‐ hand side is not, the latter being the expectation value of each term on the right‐hand side. This implies that the left‐hand side may take a different value from the right‐hand side. However, in the limit of large N, the probability for a finite difference between both sides vanishes, as will be explained in some detail in Chapter 8 under the name of a self‐ averaging property.

This assumption is the basis of the Bethe approximation. (9) The exponent η≠ 0 introduces an anomalous dimension in the dimension of the order parameter ϕ(r) from [ϕ(r)] = L −(d‐2)/2 as suggested in eqn (2.87), to [ϕ(r)] = L −(d‐2+η)/2 as seen in the generic form, eqn (1.9). The existence of this anomalous dimension rj = 0 is rooted on the existence of another microscopic length scale (apart from the correlation length) that needs to be included in the dimensional analysis because of ultraviolet divergences (i.e. divergences in short length scales). See, e.g., Section 3.9 for some more details. (10) Strictly speaking, the response function is defined in terms of a non‐ random external field.

However, it is necessary to proceed beyond the mean-field theory to better understand the situation, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when fluctuations play vital roles leading to exponents that cannot be explained by dimensional analysis, thus introducing anomalous dimensions. The present chapter explains the basic concepts of the renormalization group and scaling theory, which allow us to analyze critical phenomena with fluctuations systematically taken into account. The essential step in a renormalization group calculation consists of establishing recursion relations between the parameters defining the Hamiltonian of the system. These recursion or renormalization group equations define a flow with well-defined fixed points. Details other than the values of the relevant operators have no influence on the critical exponents and this represents universality.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 the previous chapter, the mean‐field theory loses its internal consistency for spatial dimensions less than four for the simple Ising model, and the critical exponents assume different values from the mean‐field predictions. In the present chapter we explain the basic concepts of the renormalization group and scaling theory, which allow us to analyze critical phenomena with fluctuations systematically taken into account. Implementation of the renormalization group in realistic systems will be deferred to the next chapter, except for the simple one‐ dimensional Ising model case. 3.1 Coarse‐graining and scale transformations As described in Chapter 1, the basic concept of the renormalization group is to follow the change of physical quantities as we increase the length scale by coarse graining and rescaling, which allows us to systematically take into account fluctuations near the critical point. To quantify this idea, we start from the explanation of coarse graining and (re)scaling and their consequent influences on physical quantities. In this and the next chapters H stands for the Hamiltonian divided by the temperature H/T, a dimensionless Hamiltonian, since the Hamiltonian appears always in this combination. The concepts of coarse graining and scaling will be best illustrated in the real‐space renormalization group, in which we trace out a part of the microscopic degrees of freedom such as the spin variables. Fig. 3.1 Illustration of the real‐space renormalization group. By taking the partial trace over the spin degrees of freedom marked ×, we are left with the other degrees of freedom (marked ◯), which interact with each other via new, renormalized interactions. Suppose that the spin degrees of freedom interact with their nearest neighbors on the square lattice as depicted on the left panel of Fig. 3.1. The model is not necessarily restricted to the ferromagnetic Ising model.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 3.3 Renormalization group flow near a fixed point and universality The exponent y i appearing in the eigenvalue of the linear transformation T b is an important quantity characterizing the parameter flow near the fixed point. If y i is positive, the eigenvalue b yi is larger than unity (b # 1), and the scaling field g i becomes amplified by the factor b yi after each application of the renormalization group transformation. The parameter therefore moves away from the fixed point. For negative y i, on the other hand, the parameter converges to the fixed‐point value. It is therefore concluded that all the scaling fields g i with positive exponent y i # 0 should be tuned to 0 for the system parameters to be attracted to the fixed point. Since the adjustment of the value of g i has a decisive effect on the system behavior, a scaling field with positive exponent y i # 0 is called a relevant variable or a relevant field. A scaling field with negative exponent y i # 0 rapidly diminishes toward 0 as the renormalization step proceeds and has no essential effects on the critical properties. Such scaling fields are thus called irrelevant variables. The intermediate case of y i = 0 is said to be marginal. Marginal scaling fields are associated with logarithmic corrections to scaling. Note that the notions of relevance, irrelevance or marginality are relative to a particular fixed point. A relevant variable at one fixed point may be irrelevant at another. Fig. 3.3 Schematic illustration of the parameter flow when one of the exponents is positive and the other negative, y i # 0 and y j # 0. The fixed point F has g i = g j = 0.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 3.4 Schematic diagram of the renormalization group flow in the space of interactions in the absence of external field. The nearest‐neighbor interaction is written as K 1 and the next‐nearest‐neighbor interaction as K 2. Figure 3.3 illustrates the renormalization group flow of scaling fields g i and g j with y i # 0 and y j # 0. The flow of g j with y j # 0 converges to the fixed point F at g i = g j = 0 along the horizontal line g i = 0. If, however, g i is non‐ vanishing, g i rapidly diverges away from the fixed‐point value of 0 since y i # 0. Even in this case g j approaches 0. (p. 61 ) Critical phenomena are observed in a ferromagnetic system only when the two parameters T and h are adjusted to critical values, T = T c and h = 0, as shown in Fig. 1.3. Slight deviations of these values from the critical point will drive the system away from the critical point by renormalization group operations, as mentioned in Section 1.4. This fact leads us to the identification of T and h as two quantities related to relevant variables in typical critical phenomena. The scaling fields corresponding to T and h, g 1 and g 2, will have positive exponents, y 1 # 0, y 2 # 0. The others are negative, y 3 # 0, y 4 # 0, …. The scaling fields are derived from the function realizing the transformation R b(∙), an analytic function, and hence g i should be analytic with respect to T and h. We may therefore infer that g 1 is proportional to t = (T ‐ T c)/T c and g 2 proportional to h near the fixed point. Variables other than the temperature and external field, represented by the other scaling fields g 3, g 4, …, do not affect the essential features of critical phenomena, typically the critical exponents. Details of the system properties other than the values of temperature and external field have no influence on the critical exponents. This is the statement of universality from Page 15 of 44 Renormalization group and scaling PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 the standpoint of renormalization group. We hereafter write g t, y t for g 1, y 2 and g h, y h for g 2, y 2. Figure 3.4 is a flow diagram under the condition h = 0, from which we learn important lessons on the significance of scaling fields. Various types of interactions emerge as the renormalization step proceeds, and Fig. 3.4 represents a projection of such a multidimensional space onto the two‐dimensional plane of K 1and K 2, where K 1is the nearest‐neighbor interaction divided by temperature and K 2 stands for the next‐ nearest‐ neighbor interaction divided by temperature. Each parameter changes as the renormalization proceeds. If, for instance, there are only nearest‐ neighbor interactions initially (K 2 = 0), there appear next‐nearest‐neighbor interactions (K 2 # 0) after a single step of renormalization. Since only g t is a relevant scaling field when h = 0, there is just a single direction along which the system is attracted toward the fixed point F at g t = g h = g 3 = … = 0. The g t axis corresponds to the direction along which the renormalization flow moves away from the fixed point. The other directions correspond to g 3 or other irrelevant scaling fields, along which the flow is attracted to the fixed point. (p. 62 ) It should now be clear that the scaling field g t should not be directly identified with the parameter K 1 − K 1c of the initial Hamiltonian with K 2 = 0, the so‐called bare parameter. We, nevertheless, observe that the scaling field g t, which expresses a small deviation from the fixed point, is proportional to the deviation of the initial parameter value from the critical value (K 1 − K 1c) as long as the system is close to the fixed point. Both are proportional to t = (T − T c)/T c. The set of fixed points is an important characteristic of a renormalization group study. Each fixed point u* has a set of points in parameter space, known as a basin of attraction, which flow into the fixed point u* under renormalization. The basin of attraction of a critical fixed point is called a critical surface or a critical manifold. Points on a critical manifold are attracted by renormalization to the fixed point F in Figs. 3.3 and 3.4. As seen in Fig. 3.4, the transition point (critical point) lies on the critical surface but should be distinguished from the fixed point itself. Moreover, points u on the critical surface have infinite correlation length since Page 16 of 44 Renormalization group and scaling PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 We have derived important formulas to relate the exponents of eigenvalues to critical exponents. These formulas are at the core of a theoretical framework to evaluate critical exponents from the linearized renormalization group equation and its eigenvalues. It is worth remembering here that there are usually only two relevant scaling fields, i.e. positive exponents #t and #h, which implies that the four critical exponents α,β,γ, δ are not completely independent. Knowledge of two of them is sufficient to determine the remaining two. The scaling relations are explicit expressions of this fact, which can be derived by eliminating #t and #h from eqn (3.44), Page 21 of 44 Renormalization group and scaling PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Show that the exponent of renormalization # of the external field h at the discontinuity fixed point is equal to the spatial dimension d. As a hint, the correlation length does not diverge at a first‐order transition, in contrast to a second‐order phase transition. This means that the correlation function does not decay as a power law, from which one can infer the scaling dimension. 3.6 A simple example: One‐dimensional Ising model Fig. 3.5 Spin variables on even‐numbered sites are traced out as a realization of the real space renormalization group. It is instructive to illustrate the general ideas using a simple example. We can solve the one‐dimensional Ising model exactly without recourse to the renormalization group, as will be shown in Chapter 9. Nevertheless, it is well worth studying this model by the renormalization group because this is one of the rare examples in which the renormalization steps can be carried out exactly. Another reason is that we can compare the result with the exact solution to check if the prescription of the renormalization group works as expected. (p. 68 ) 3.6.1 Recursion relation Let us take the sum over half of the spin degrees of freedom, that is, over the spins on even‐numbered sites, as a simple realization of the renormalization group for the one‐dimensional Ising model. This is one of the simplest cases of the real‐space renormalization group. This method is also called decimation.

The remaining task is to find the forms of K′ and h′ as functions of K and h explicitly and to estimate the eigenvalues of the linearized recursion relation around a fixed point. Notice that in this problem the renormalization group mapping preserves the form of the Hamiltonian with renormalized parameters. In other words, the mapping does not generate new couplings as in the two‐dimensional case of eqn (3.14). (p. 69 ) To obtain K′ and h′, we equate the right‐hand side of eqn (3.59) to eqn (3.60) and write four relations resulting from the four combinations, (S 1 = ±1, S 3 = ±1). Actually, (S 1 = 1,S 3 = −1) and (S 1 = −1,S 3 = 1) give the same relation, and we find three equations, which are necessary and sufficient to determine K′,h′ and A as functions of K and h.

This corresponds to the high‐temperature limit (K = 0) and has no important physical significance. It represents the disordered phase. (ii) x* = 0,#* = 1, i.e. T = 0,h = 0. This is a critical point (repulsive or unstable fixed point). As shown in the phase diagram of Fig. 3.7, which is drawn in terms of the conventional variables T and h instead of x and #, the ordered phase of the one‐dimensional Ising model is restricted to a single point at T = 0, h = 0. Figure 3.6 shows that the fixed point (ii) is unstable against infinitesimal introduction of finite values of T and h. Thus, these two variables are relevant at this fixed point. (iii) The last fixed point is at x* = 0 and #* = 0 or T = 0 and h = ∞. This is also uninteresting similarly to (i). We now linearize the recursion relation (3.66) around the fixed point (ii) and evaluate the eigenvalues.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Therefore, by considering ξ to be the only fundamental physical quantity with a dimension of length, we can derive scaling relations. For instance, the free energy per degree of freedom, f, has the scaling dimension d, as was mentioned in Section 3.1, and the correlation length ξ, the standard of distance, has the same scaling dimension −1 as the length. These facts lead us to the relation between f and ξ, Page 34 of 44 Renormalization group and scaling PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 It turns out that in the Gaussian model of Section 2.9 the scaling dimension of the magnetization field ϕ(r) is identical to the dimension obtained from the dimensional analysis, i.e. x ϕ = d ϕ. As we will explain below, this is why the exponent η of the Gaussian model is zero, as in the mean‐field case. In general, the scaling dimension is not identical to the canonical dimension obtained from the dimensional analysis. The difference between the two is proportional to what is known as the anomalous dimension. For example, in a theory whose two‐ point correlation function of scalar fields has non‐ vanishing η, the anomalous dimension means that d ϕ − x ϕ = (1 − d/2) − (d # #ϕ) = η/2 ≠ 0.6 This may also happen to other critical exponents such as ν but in those cases it is customary not to give any special name or symbol to the difference. We have already seen in Chapter 2 that mean‐field theories (such as the Landau theory) share, regardless of the details, the same set of critical exponents typically represented in terms of rational numbers. An important observation is that the exponents of any mean‐field theory can be obtained from considerations of simple dimensional analysis. This fact explains why those exponents are not irrational numbers. Therefore, a central task of the theory of critical phenomena is to explain and determine those anomalous dimensions, for example, by using the renormalization group method. After (p. 76 ) all, critical behavior is dominated by fluctuations at all length scales, including lengths smaller than ξ. The argument that close to the critical point the microscopic length a may be ignored since ξ ≫ a is not always accurate, as will be shown below. In other words, if there were no anomalous dimensions, the whole field of critical phenomena would be quite boring since all critical exponents would acquire the mean‐field values. The reason behind the existence of anomalous dimensions can be heuristically attributed to the importance of irrelevant fields (or variables, or operators) in establishing scaling, and thus modifying exponents. For example, in Exercise 3.2 one showed that the lattice constant a is an irrelevant variable, and we said in the paragraph above that critical phenomena are dominated by fluctuations at all length scales, including the microscopic (minimal) length a or, equivalently a given short‐wavelength cutoff Λ−1 in the terminology of field theory (see Chapter 5). Then, it may happen that the correlation length ξ is insufficient to establish the right scaling and one also needs to take into account a, which we show below. In the two‐point correlation function of eqn (3.53) the effect of the microscopic length a has been ignored since a ≪ ξ.

Indeed, this is the exact scaling behavior of the Gaussian model, i.e. eqn (2.87), and of mean‐field theories in general. However, in most of the interesting cases, η ≠ 0.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 for any h and t. More practically, for a fixed h, we scan t and plot the values of t −β m(t, h) with the above‐ mentioned abscissa and ordinate. Then, the same process is repeated for another fixed value of h. If the scaling law does not apply, the second plot will give a different curve from the first. However, due to the scaling law (3.95), the values of t −β m(t, h) coincide for different hs for the same value of ht −β δ. The above procedure is repeated for various values of h. In practice, we have no precise knowledge of β and δ beforehand, and it is necessary to guess these values to proceed by trial and error to find the appropriate β and δ, by which a single curve is obtained to a satisfactory precision. Next, we show how to extract critical exponents from numerical data for the magnetic susceptibility. Critical phenomena take place in macroscopic systems, and physical quantities show singular behavior near a critical point theoretically only when the system size is infinite. We can, however, carry out numerical computations only for finite‐size systems. It is therefore necessary to estimate critical exponents, which characterize singularities of infinite systems, from the data for finite‐size systems. The idea of finite‐ size scaling is a well‐established method for this purpose. We will see later in this section that finite‐size scaling can also be interpreted as a crossover phenomenon in terms of the size of the system. Suppose that we perform the process of renormalization group for a system on a hypercubic lattice with linear size L. The parameters of the system should be carefully tuned for the system to be at the critical point, i.e. t = h = 0. This condition only applies to the infinite‐size system, L → ∞. We interpret this last fact as the condition that the parameter L −1 must be tuned to 0 in addition to t = h = 0 to keep the system at the critical point, which implies that L −1 is a relevant variable. We thus include L −1 in the argument of the free energy and write Page 37 of 44 Renormalization group and scaling PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 (3.100) This relation shows that the critical temperature T c (or t = 0) can be determined as the intersection point of curves ξ(t, L −1)/L versus t for different sizes L since ξ(t = 0,L −1)/L has no L dependence. We notice a couple of points in relation to finite‐size scaling. The magnetic susceptibility diverges at the critical point in the thermodynamic limit L → ∞ but remains finite for finite‐size systems. Then, where does the peak of the susceptibility appear in a finite‐size system? According to eqn (3.98), the peak of the susceptibility in a finite‐size system as a function of temperature coincides with the peak of the scaling function ̃Ψ(x), which may or may not be located at x = 0, i.e. t = 0. If the peak of ̃Ψ(x) is located at x = c(≠ 0), the peak of the susceptibility as a function of temperature T is at t = cL −1/ν (the sign of c depends on the boundary conditions). This implies that the peak is shifted from t = 0 for the infinite‐size system to cL −1/ν. We sometimes call 1/ν the shift exponent for this reason. Another point to be noticed is the height of the peak of the finite‐size susceptibility, which is proportional to L 2−η. This observation allows us to estimate 2 − η from numerical data for the peak value. (p. 79 ) 3.11 Crossover phenomena In some cases we should tune the values of more than two parameters to observe richer critical phenomena. An example is the tricritical point explained in Section 2.4 in the context of the Blume–Capel model. In such a case there are more than two relevant variables. In the present section we elucidate the concept of crossover between two different types of critical phenomena that typically takes place when three or more relevant variables compete. In other words, the phenomenon of crossover happens when more than one critical fixed point appears in the phase diagram. Suppose that a system has two or more relevant variables.

In real- and momentum-space renormalization group theory, there are no general prescriptions to systematically improve the degree of the approximation with a modest amount of effort. There are established methods to systematically improve precision, but they usually need a large amount of numerical calculations. The scope of the present chapter is modest as we limit ourselves to basic examples, including the epsilon expansion about the Gaussian fixed-point of the Landau-Ginzburg- Wilson model. Finally, the last section illustrates the extension of the renormalization group framework to study quantum phase transitions. Keywords:   Ising models, LGW model, epsilon expansion, renormalization group theory, quantum phase transition We have formulated the general framework of the renormalization group theory. It has been shown that the eigenvalues of a linearized recursion relation around the fixed point determine the critical exponents. It has also been elucidated that the free energy and related functions satisfy scaling laws, which are useful to analyze experimental and numerical data. We next derive explicit forms of the recursion relation and find its fixed points and eigenvalues. This chapter will discuss these topics. In contrast to the elegant general theory of the previous chapter, actual computations of fixed points and eigenvalues usually involve approximations, often crude ones, except Page 2 of 30 Implementation of the renormalization group PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 for a very limited number of simple cases such as the one‐dimensional Ising model of the previous chapter. There are established methods to systematically improve precision, but they usually need a large number of (often numerical) calculations. The scope of the present chapter is modest as we limit ourselves to basic examples. It is often difficult to present a general prescription directly applicable to practical problems that the reader may have at hand. Nevertheless, studies of well‐known instances will help better understand the renormalization group in general and may provide hints to attack novel unsolved problems. 4.1 Real‐space renormalization group for arbitrary dimensions We have already discussed the simple example of the one‐dimensional Ising model. When the spatial dimension of the system is two or higher, the partial trace operation generates various complicated interactions, and it rapidly becomes difficult to explicitly implement the renormalization group in terms of a tractable number of parameters. It thus becomes essential to introduce certain approximations. Unfortunately, in realspace renormalization group theory, there are no generic prescriptions applicable to arbitrary problems of practical interest to systematically improve the degree of approximation. We therefore have to devise a clever approximate method to treat the problem of interest, taking full advantage of the specific features of the problem. The following are some representative examples. 4.1.1 Partial sums and the two‐dimensional Ising model What happens if we naively trace over a part of the spin variables on the square lattice as in Fig. 3.1? Implementation of the trace operation in this situation has (p. 84 ) been carried out in Exercise 3.1 and represents a particular coarse‐graining scheme. The result shows that three types of interactions are generated after the partial trace when only nearest‐neighbor interactions exist initially and h = 0. More explicitly if we denote the initial nearest‐neighbor interaction by K and the renormalized nearest‐ neighbor, next‐nearest‐neighbor and the four‐spin interaction around a plaquette (unit square) by K′,K′1 and K′2, respectively we find Page 3 of 30 Implementation of the renormalization group PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

(p. 90 ) 4.1.3 Migdal Kadanoff renormalization group Another approximate real‐space renormalization group method often used in practice is the Migdal‐Kadanoff renormalization group (MKRG). A main technical problem in the real‐space renormalization group method is the difficulty in taking partial sums except for the one‐dimensional case. To avoid this problem, let us adopt an approximation that ignores part of the interactions, as illustrated in Fig. 4.3 for b = 2. To partly compensate for possible errors caused by this approximation, we multiply the remaining interaction by the factor b(= 2). Then, the spins denoted by crosses in the middle panel of Fig. 4.3 can be traced out easily as in the one‐dimensional case. The remaining spins shown in black dots have only nearest‐neighbor interactions. The type of interactions, nearest‐neighbor only, is kept intact and only the strength of the interactions has been renormalized from K to K′. Then, we are able to repeat the renormalization group calculations for the single variable K to find the fixed point and eigenvalues. Let us show explicit formulas to realize the MKRG for b = 2. The remaining interactions in the middle panel of Fig. 4.3 have a strength of 2K. The partial trace over the spins shown as crosses can be carried out as in the one‐ dimensional case, see eqn (3.70), and tanh2K is squared, Page 12 of 30 Implementation of the renormalization group PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The arrows indicate the directions of the renormalization flow of K. (p. 92 ) In general, a problem with the real‐space renormalization group method is that the limit of applicability of the approximations involved is not clear in most cases. We therefore are not certain beforehand how far we may trust the result. Thus, we should be careful in applying the real‐space renormalization group to problems for which we do not have an idea about the correct result derived by other methods such as numerical simulations or physical intuition. Nevertheless, it is sometimes important to have a way to reach a solution, albeit approximate, when other methods are not easily employed for whatever reasons. 4.2 Momentum‐space renormalization group: ϵ = 4 − d expansion The accuracy of the block‐spin transformation deteriorates as the spatial dimension d increases. For instance, imagine that neighboring 3×3 spins on the square lattice are represented by a single block spin, assuming values ±1, determined by the majority rule. The same block‐spin operation in three dimensions involves 33 = 3 × 3 × 3 spins. In a general d‐dimensional case a block spin having values ±1 replaces 3d spins by the simple majority rule. The range of the sum for 3d spins, ‐3d, ‐3d + 2, ‐3d + 4, …, 3d, increases with d, and the approximation to assign ±1 to a block spin becomes more and more inappropriate as d increases. This consideration suggests to use continuous‐spin variables (i.e. fields), as in the Landau theory, defined over Page 15 of 30 Implementation of the renormalization group PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

We therefore discuss the properties of a continuous model near four dimensions in the present section. More details about field‐theoretic descriptions of statistical systems will be developed in Chapter 5. 4.2.1 Gaussian fixed point A standard model with continuous spin variables (fields) in continuous space is the χ4 model or the Landau‐Ginzburg‐Wilson model, (p. 93 ) Page 16 of 30 Implementation of the renormalization group PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

We are thus justified to ignore the u term and discuss the Gaussian model if d # 4.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 integrands of the denominator and numerator cancel out. Since the saddle‐ point equation is written only in terms of the variable ϕ without u, the saddle‐ point value of ϕ(x) is independent of u. This means that the saddle‐point value of ϕ(x) in front of the exponential function in the numerator does not depend on u. Consequently, the asymptotic form of m as u → 0 is not influenced by the ratio of the integrals, implying the desired result m ∝ u −½. (p. 96 ) 4.2.2 Expansion from four dimensions The quartic term is relevant below four dimensions. We therefore have to find a non‐ Gaussian fixed point and study the renormalization flow around it. A standard method to study critical phenomena is the ϵ expansion, in which we expand critical exponents around four dimensions as a power series in terms of ϵ = 4 − d, i.e. near the upper critical dimension. When the quartic term is relevant, the renormalization group recursion relation of the ϕ 4 model, for t and u, has a fixed point with t* = 0 and u* = 0. The recursion relation should have a little different form from the corresponding one near the Gaussian fixed point (4.43). We may, nevertheless, expect that the effects of u are not too large near four dimensions and thus a cumulant expansion in the quartic term would be useful. Actual manipulations to derive the explicit recursion relations are delegated to Appendix A.5.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 4.5 The left panel is for the case d # 4 and has a set of points (critical surface) that are attracted to the Gaussian fixed point at t* = u* = 0. All points on this critical surface (represented as a line in the figure) flow toward the Gaussian fixed point and have the standard critical exponents of the mean‐field theory. This is the universality of critical exponents stated in terms of the renormalization group. The situation changes in the right panel when d # 4, in which a non‐Gaussian fixed point attracts points on the critical surface. The external field h is set to zero in both cases and the system has only one relevant variable corresponding to the temperature. When d # 4 the Gaussian fixed point is unstable along the two directions. The result t* = ‐ (Λ2/6)ϵ, u* = (Λ4/9c)ϵ means that the Gaussian fixed point destabilizes below four dimensions and a non‐Gaussian fixed point t* # 0, u* # 0 emerges. Figure 4.5 illustrates this situation in the t‐u plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to the external field can be evaluated in essentially the same manner, and (p. 98 ) the resulting exponent is y h = 3 ‐ ϵ/2 to leading order in ϵ. The critical exponents are then written explicitly to first order in ϵ as, for instance, ν = 1/(2 ‐ e/3) ≈ ½ + ϵ/12 and, to #(ϵ), η = d + 2 ‐ 2y h = d+ 2 − (6 − ϵ) = 0, which means that η = #(ϵ2). The above discussions apply to systems with a one‐component (n = 1) order parameter, the Ising model being the typical example. A similar theory has been developed for multicomponent cases like the XY and Heisenberg models with their critical exponents evaluated below four dimensions as series expansions in powers of ϵ. Summarizing, we have sketched a theoretical framework to systematically derive the deviations of critical exponents from their mean‐field values in powers of ϵ = 4 ‐ d, i.e. near the upper critical dimension. As long as the trivial fixed‐point constitutes a reasonable starting point and one has enough information about it, the ϵ expansion represents a useful tool. These expansions are actually not Taylor‐series expansions but asymptotic expansions. According to the properties of the asymptotic expansion explained in Appendix A.1, we may expect to have good estimates of the Page 22 of 30 Implementation of the renormalization group PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The following table summarizes the expansions of α, β and γ to #(ϵ2) as functions of the number of components n of the basic operator, n = 1 for the Ising model and n = 2 for the XY model, for example.

This is the exact value for the surface (boundary) magnetization. One should notice, however, that the right‐most spin with j = N has β* = 0 from the same argument using eqn (4.91), which is inconsistent with β* = ½ for j = 1. Hence, the present method is an approximation, which happens to give a part of the exact values for the critical point and critical exponents.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Statistical field theory Hidetoshi Nishimori, Gerardo Ortiz Abstract and Keywords Statistical-mechanical systems often involve discrete elementary degrees of freedom such as spins in the Ising model. Field theories, on the other hand, have continuous fields, defined over the whole space-time or part of it, as fundamental degrees of freedom. These two seemingly different descriptions of physical phenomena can be related close to the critical point. The present chapter summarizes how the description by continuous fields emerges from discrete degrees of freedom in a more systematic manner than in previous chapters. The phenomenological Landau-Ginzburg approach, based on the concept of order parameter, is expanded to generate effective field theories. The important roles of symmetry and topology are also elucidated in some detail. Also shown are some of the important consequences of having a broken-symmetry phase, such as long-range order, the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone modes when the symmetry involved is continuous, and topological defects.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 between degrees of freedom over long distances is independent of the microscopic details of the theory. This is true for both discrete variables and fields alike, and what conceptually connects the two representations is the hypothesis of universality underlying the renormalization group framework. In the present chapter we summarize how the description by continuous fields emerges from discrete degrees of freedom in a more systematic manner than in previous chapters. The important roles of symmetry and topology are also elucidated in some detail. 5.1 From bits to fields At its most fundamental level, the microscopic description of matter is in terms of its elementary degrees of freedom, such as spins {S j} in the case of a magnet, or positions and momenta {q j, p j} in the case of an atomic gas. Typically, the time evolution of those degrees of freedom is governed by a set of equations of motion derivable from a Hamiltonian, H, or a Lagrangian density, ℒ, that encodes the interactions between those elementary degrees of freedom, or by master equations in the case of open systems (i.e. systems that are not isolated but coupled to some external environment) as described in Chapter 11. One can imagine that solving these equations for many degrees of freedom (say N = 1023) is a daunting task that not only involves great complexity but also is prone to failure. It is, in general, an intractable problem, except for limited cases, as discussed in Chapter 9. To attack this problem, one of the common procedures consists in performing some sort of averaging, i.e. coarse graining, over many degrees of freedom with the expectation that the system still retains its main physical properties, and at the same time, the problem becomes manageable. The averaged degrees of freedom are no longer discrete but turn into slowly varying continuous fields, thus eliminating the short‐ wavelength (short‐ distance) modes. A field represents an infinite number of degrees of freedom and it is, in general, a tensor‐valued function of the coordinates r (or space‐ time). It happens that this methodology is more accurate when the relevant physics one is trying to describe is regulated by the collective behavior of those elementary (p. 106 ) degrees of freedom, where long wavelengths and long times are involved. As indicated in previous chapters, it is precisely at a critical region where fluctuations have long wavelengths and are correlated over distances of the order of the correlation length, ξ ≫ a, with a denoting some microscopic distance, typically the lattice constant. Therefore, the local connectivity of the lattice, e.g. whether it is the square lattice or the Page 3 of 28 Statistical field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 triangular lattice, is irrelevant from the standpoint of critical properties. It is only relevant to determine non‐universal properties such as the specific value of the critical temperature. These correlated fluctuations involve many elementary degrees of freedom and, thus, critical phenomena represent one of those problems where a description by statistical field theory seems appropriate. The equivalence between the original model described in terms of discrete variables and the field theory is not usually realized by an exact algebraic mapping, like in the one‐dimensional quantum XY and free Fermion models in Section 9.4. It should rather be regarded as an equivalence in the sense that both models share the same critical behavior and thus belong to the same universality class. One may conjecture that, as long as the statistical‐ mechanical system displays universal behavior at criticality there should be a corresponding statistical field theory that describes the same physics of long wavelength. Indeed, we have already seen a few examples of statistical field theories, e.g. the Gaussian model in Sections 2.9 and 4.2. In this chapter we summarize more systematic approaches to the foundation of statistical field theories. The present exposition will also serve as a bridge to the conformal field theory described in the next chapter. Also explained are the roles of symmetry and topology, in particular the concepts of symmetry breaking, long‐range order and topological defects, which are essential to the deep understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena. 5.2 Continuum limit and field theory Fig. 5.1 One‐dimensional series of torsion pendulums.

Since we are interested in studying the thermodynamic aspects of field theories, i.e. statistical field theories, we would like to compute their generating functional Z. This latter quantity corresponds to the partition function of statistical mechanics and is defined in terms of an action S[ϕ], which plays a similar role as the Hamiltonian in classical statistical mechanics. More precisely, one analytically continues time as t → −it, which changes the Minkowski space with infinitesimal distance (dr)2 − (dt)2 to the Euclidean space with (dr)2 + (dt)2.

In those cases, the way a continuous field is generated requires some care since there is a constraint in the allowed values for the variables. Finally, most of the statistical field theories require a physical cutoff to be mathematically well defined to avoid infinite integrals. These cutoffs determine the limits of integration. An infrared cutoff refers to a longdistance (or small‐momentum or low‐energy) cutoff, while an ultraviolet cutoff alludes to a short‐distance (or large‐momentum or high‐energy) cutoff. 5.3 Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation In this section we illustrate a process to start from a microscopic lattice model and derive its mapping to a functional integral over continuous fields. The Ising model on a d‐dimensional hypercubic lattice with lattice constant a is taken as an example. The technique is known as the Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation, or the Gaussian transformation, and is a generalization of the completing‐the‐square method in the standard Gaussian integration.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 One can continue with the construction of a new Hamiltonian by defining new block‐ spin variables from the coarse‐grained {S ζ(r)} ones. This coarse graining, or cell, procedure is simply the block‐spin transformation of Chapter 4 and is the basis of the real‐space renormalization group method. The main point, though, is that eventually the coarse‐grained variables {S ζ(r)} become a field ϕ (r), or set of fields {ϕ i(r)}, of a continuous variable r and the partition function can be expressed as a functional integral Page 12 of 28 Statistical field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 5.5 Phenomenological Landau–Ginzburg approach An alternative program to generate effective field theories is the Landau– Ginzburg approach. One constructs the effective Hamiltonian in a phenomenological way in terms of collective degrees of freedom expressed as the field of order parameter Φ(r) = {ϕ 1(r),…, ϕ n(r)}, with the symmetry of the microscopic Hamiltonian taken into account. For example, a one‐ component scalar field (n = 1) may describe the standard liquid–gas transition or the uniaxial Ising ferromagnet. A two‐component, or complex, field describes a transition to a superfluid or superconducting phase, and a three‐ component, vector, field describes a classical magnetic transition. More esoteric order parameters include second‐rank tensorial quantities that describe the transition to nematic or smectic liquid‐crystal phases. This process results in an effective field theory with couplings that are functions not only of the original microscopic couplings but also of external control parameters such as the temperature. Strictly speaking, the effective Hamiltonian H̃ is neither a proper Hamiltonian nor a free energy since, for example, couplings in H̃ depend on the temperature and fields. Also, the variables and their derivatives are not connected by canonical dynamical relations. One should take into account several constraints in constructing the effective Hamiltonian. The first observation is that, if the original degrees of freedom are defined (p. 114 ) in a real space with local, short‐range, interactions, one would expect that the resulting continuous fields define a local field theory, Page 13 of 28 Statistical field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 5.6 Symmetry and its breakdown Symmetry is one of the key concepts to characterize phase transitions, or physical phenomena at large. For example, it is well known that the invariance of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian with respect to time translation leads to the conservation of energy. Similarly, invariance with respect to spatial translation is at the origin of momentum conservation. Noether's theorem as proved in Appendix A.6 is a general statement about a conservation law resulting from a continuous symmetry of the system. The existence of symmetries in a physical system is formally expressed by the invariance of the Hamiltonian under the operation of elements of a group that specifies (p. 117 ) the symmetry. A simple example is the Ising model without external field, in which the overall (global) change of sign, S i → −S i (∀i), keeps the Hamiltonian invariant. This operation is an element of the group ℤ2 consisting of two elements {1, −1}. The change of sign corresponds to the element −1, whereas the trivial element 1 changes nothing and represents the identity element. Another example of a global symmetry is the Heisenberg model, again in the absence of external field. The rotation of all spins by the same angle, S i → R ∙ S i (∀i), where R is a matrix of rotation in the three‐dimensional spin space, leaves the Hamiltonian invariant because the interaction S i ∙ S j is an inner product. The corresponding group is called SO (3) and the above‐ mentioned rotation matrix R is a representation of this group. The language of group theory is often very useful to describe symmetry properties of a physical system. We give a brief introduction to group theory in Appendix A.7 for the reader's convenience. In particular, the concept and language of Lie group and Lie algebra are of central importance in the following chapter of conformal field theory. Although the text of this book is written as readably as possible without detailed knowledge of group theory, it is nevertheless useful to go through the appendix to better understand the background. The symmetry of a Hamiltonian should be distinguished from the symmetry of a state of the same system. For instance, the Hamiltonian of the Ising model without external field has the ℤ2 symmetry, but a state, for example the all‐up state, S i = 1 (∀i), clearly changes into a different state, S i = −1 (∀i), by the global reversal of the sign. This observation implies that the symmetry possessed by the Hamiltonian may be broken down in the states that are actually realized in the physical world. This is the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking and has been discussed already several times in this book. It should be noted that a global symmetry can be broken Page 17 of 28 Statistical field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 spontaneously but a local symmetry, the invariance of a Hamiltonian by an operation involving only a finite number of local degrees of freedom, is never broken spontaneously. This important comment will be further clarified in Section 7.7. One of the central remarks in this section is that a symmetry can be broken spontaneously only in the thermodynamic limit. Let us again take the example of the Ising model. A quantitative measure of symmetry breaking is the order parameter, the spontaneous magnetization in the present example. The magnetization per site as a function of the external field, m N(h), for system size N, is an analytic function of h as long as N is finite. The reason is that the partition function Z N(h) is a sum of finite number of Boltzmann factors e−βH and thus m N(h), the logarithmic derivative of Z N(h) with respect to h, is not a singular function of h. Thus, m N(h), an odd function of h, has a well‐defined limit Page 18 of 28 Statistical field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

This may be interpreted as the system displaying a generalized rigidity or stiffness. If a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, on the other hand, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian generically has gapless collective excitations or soft modes. A soft mode means that changes along particular directions in the space of order parameters require no energy. The mexican‐hat potential shown in Fig. 5.3 is a typical example, in which the system can move freely along the bottom of the potential. Fig. 5.3 A continuum of minima exists for the mexican‐hat‐type potential V. The system can continuously change its lowest‐energy state from one of the continuous minima of the potential to another one without energy cost. These emergent excitations characterizing the ordered phase are known as the Nambu‐Goldstone modes. Examples of these low‐energy excitations include spin waves in the XY model, as explained in Chapter 7 (because of the spontaneous breaking of the spin rotational symmetry) and acoustic phonons in crystalline solids (because of the breaking of the space translational symmetry). The existence of these low‐ energy excitations is the essence of the Goldstone theorem. This theorem states essentially that, whenever a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken in a system with short‐range interactions there exist modes with zero excitation energy and a continuous spectrum above it. As will be exemplified later, this fact manifests itself (p. 121 ) in the behavior of a correlation function in the Fourier space where that correlation function has a pole at zero wave number.

In contrast, the images in (c) and (d) are equivalent to each other but cannot be continuously reduced to a point as in (a) since those in (c) and (d) wind the circumference of #1. We say in the latter case that the winding number is k = 1. Also, in the real space ℝ2, we can continuously change the spin configuration of (b) into (a) and also (c) changes into (d), the latter by rotating each (p. 124 ) spin roughly by 90°. Such a continuous rotation never succeeds in changing (a) to (c). The two configurations (a) and (b) are said to belong to the same homotopy class. Similarly the homotopy class of (c) and (d) is the same. In general, two configurations are equivalent and belong to the same homotopy class if one of them can be deformed continuously to the other.

The subscript 1 of π1 means that the loop Γ, a one‐dimensional object, is used to map the configuration in ℝ2 to #1. Thus, the homotopy class is classified by the group ℤ, in which the usual rule of addition represents the multiplication as a group. The addition (or the aggregation) of two vortices of winding numbers k 1 and k 2 realizes a single vortex with winding number k = k 1 + k 2. This is one of the simplest examples of the homotopy group. These discussions can be generalized to arbitrary types of topological defects, not just in spin systems but also in solids and liquid crystals. We, however, restrict ourselves to spin systems for simplicity of presentation and consider next the XY model in three spatial dimensions R3. The basic topological defect is a line of vortices created by stacking vortices, each on a two‐dimensional cross‐section. We write d d for the dimensionality of the defect, and d d = 1 for a vortex line in ℝ:3. The previous case of two dimensions has d d = 0 since a vortex is an isolated point in ℝ2. In the case of ℝ3, the order parameter space is again #1 because the orientation of a spin can be specified by a point on #1. The homotopy group is also the same, π1(#1) = ℤ, each element being specified by the winding number counted along a loop surrounding a vortex line. Fig. 5.6 A loop around a two‐dimensional sphere slips on the surface by a continuous deformation and shrinks to a point. The Heisenberg model has three components and its order parameter space is #2 as mentioned already. The basic topological defect is a hedgehog structure, and in its most basic form, all spins point outward on the surface of #2. The topological invariant is the wrapping number. The above‐mentioned simplest hedgehog has the wrapping number 1. The relevant homotopy group is π2(#2) = ℤ. The subscript 2 of π2 is meant for the two‐dimensional sphere that wraps the topological defect. If we choose a loop, a one‐ dimensional object, to encircle a topological defect of the Heisenberg model, the loop slips on the surface of the order parameter space #2 to eventually Page 27 of 28 Statistical field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Table 5.1 shows the types of defects. In the case of an ordered medium with a discrete symmetry group, such as the ℤ2 symmetry of the Ising model, topological defects have the dimensionality d d = d − 1. They are always generalized domain walls separating regions with different values of the order parameter Φ. Notes: (1) The change t → −it in eqn (5.4) yields the opposite sign for ℒ. This does no harm if we choose an appropriate sign in exponentiating the action to define the statistical weight, as will be done shortly.

The goal is to catalogue universality classes as a list of possible values of critical exponents and to find restrictions on the functional forms of correlation functions, which satisfy conformal Ward identities. From a mathematics standpoint, conformal symmetry applies to continuum theories, and therefore its obvious application to critical phenomena is formulated in the language of field theory. The energy-momentum tensor plays a fundamental role in defining the conformal generators that satisfy the Virasoro algebra, and any conformal field theory is characterized by the central charge a number that is important to classify critical field theories. One of the most remarkable applications of conformal field theory is found in the analysis of finite-size effects. Keywords:   local scale transformation, conformal invariance, universality class, correlation function, primary operators, Ward identity, Virasoro algebra, central charge We have seen that a statistical system is scale invariant at criticality. Physical properties remain the same if we change the length scale by a constant factor. It is then natural to generalize the hypothesis of global scale invariance to an invariance under a coordinate‐dependent local scaling factor. It turns out that this approach is enormously successful in two dimensions and produces a number of remarkable results. The present chapter is an introductory account of the basic concepts and important Page 2 of 31 Conformal field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 consequences of conformal symmetry i.e. the invariance under local scale transformations, in field theories characterizing critical behavior. The goal is to catalog universality classes as a list of possible values of critical exponents and to find restrictions on the functional forms of correlation functions. From a mathematics standpoint, conformal symmetry applies to continuum theories, and therefore its obvious application to critical phenomena is formulated in the language of field theory. In this chapter, we do not discuss the microscopic model that gave origin to a particular continuum field theory, or in other words, that belongs to the same universality class. We will assume that such a statistical field theory exists and will study the physical and mathematical consequences of that theory being conformally invariant in the critical regime. 6.1 From scale invariance to conformal symmetry In Chapters 1 and 3 we discussed the remarkable fact that scale invariance emerges close to a critical point. A scale transformation is mathematically represented as a dilation, i.e. a coordinate transformation r → r′ = b −1 r with b a positive number. The hypothesis of scale invariance leads to many conclusions, for instance, that all critical exponents can be expressed in terms of a few scaling parameters, typically y t and y h. Then, it seems natural to think that at criticality (a point of self‐similarity) more symmetries could emerge: One may wonder whether in the critical region a coordinate‐ dependent scale invariance is possible, i.e. r → r′ = b(r)−1 r, which would certainly have further implications. This is the extension of scale invariance to conformal invariance. The hypothesis of conformal invariance appears to be quite generally true in critical equilibrium systems as a result of the essential locality of the underlying statistical field theory. We will assume conformal invariance of critical field theories throughout this chapter. The predictive power of the use of conformal symmetry depends on the dimensionality d of the system under study. For d ≥ 3, conformal symmetry fixes possible functional forms of some of the correlation functions. In two dimensions, much stronger (p. 129 ) results can be derived because the set of conformal transformations includes analytic functions of complex numbers and there are infinitely many of them. Conformal field theory then becomes an exercise in the theory of complex variables and analytic functions. As a consequence, a number of remarkable results emerge such as a list of possible critical exponents, admissible forms of correlation functions at criticality, and constraints on finite‐size effects. Our discussions in the present chapter will therefore be focused on the two‐dimensional case. Page 3 of 31 Conformal field theory PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition Hidetoshi Nishimori, Gerardo Ortiz Abstract and Keywords As the spatial dimensionality $d$ decreases, fluctuations become larger and the stability of the low-temperature ordered state deteriorates. The dimensionality where long-range order disappears is known as lower critical dimension. For instance, the Ising model in one dimension does not display long-range order at finite temperatures, however in two dimensions Peierls argument explains why the same model has an ordered phase below a certain critical temperature. If the basic variables and symmetries are continuous as in the $XY$ and Heisenberg models, the (long-range) ordered state at any finite temperature disappears already in two dimensions. This is the result of Mermin-Wagner's theorem. The $XY$ model nevertheless undergoes an unusual phase transition without an onset of long-range order in two dimensions, which is known as the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Gauge or local symmetries cannot spontaneously be broken as elucidated by Elitzur's theorem when applied to lattice gauge theories. Keywords:   Peierls argument, lower critical dimension, Elitzur theorem, lattice gauge theory As the spatial dimensionality d decreases, fluctuations become larger and the stability of the low‐temperature ordered state deteriorates. Consequently, for instance, the Ising model in one dimension does not display long‐range order at finite temperatures, i.e. does not have an ordered phase. If the basic variables and symmetries are continuous as in the XY and Heisenberg models, the (long‐range) ordered state at any finite temperature disappears already in two dimensions.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 nevertheless, undergoes an unusual phase transition without an onset of long‐range order in two dimensions, which is known as the Kosterlitz‐ Thouless transition. We describe the theory of such interesting behavior in this chapter. Also elucidated is Elitzur's theorem for the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in lattice gauge theories. 7.1 Peierls argument Mean‐field theory correctly describes conventional critical phenomena above four dimensions (the upper critical dimension). As the spatial dimensionality d decreases, the effects of interactions between a spin and its neighbors become weaker due mainly to the decrease in the number of neighbors, and eventually long‐range order disappears at finite temperatures below a certain dimension. This borderline dimensionality is the lower critical dimension d ǀc. Systems with discrete degrees of freedom such as the Ising model have d ǀc=1 and systems with continuous symmetries have typically d ǀc=2. In the present section we introduce an argument that makes clear the difference, as far as long‐range order at finite temperatures is concerned, between the one‐ and two‐ dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models. The argument can generically be applied to other systems such as the antiferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. Indeed, it constitutes a very useful tool to argue for the existence of long‐range order at finite temperature in cases where no exact solution is available. The following sections will discuss the conditions for the existence and absence of long‐ range order in the XY model. Fig. 7.1 Spin configurations where some spins are reversed from the ferromagnetic (all +) ground state in one dimension (left), and two dimensions (right). The first example is the one‐dimensional Ising model, for which we develop a physical picture for the absence of long‐range order not by solving the model explicitly (see Section 9.1) but by comparing the energy and entropy Page 3 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The right‐most spin remains free. The ground state to be realized at T=0 has all spins up because of our particular boundary condition. As the temperature increases from zero, excited states appear, in which some spins have the opposite direction (down or −) as in the left panel of Fig. 7.1. A parallel pair of (p. 154 ) spins (++or−−) have energy −J and antiparallel pairs (+− or −+) have energy J, with J # 0. Thus, the energy to reverse the state of a pair from the lower (parallel) to higher (antiparallel) energy configuration is +2 J. The number of locations where such a reversal may happen is L ‐ 1 ≈ L, for large L, which implies an entropy of log L. It follows that the free‐energy increase due to the spin reversal is Page 4 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The factor N results from the fact that there (p. 155 ) are at most N sites to start from.1 Then, the entropy is log(3 Γ N ), and the free energy cost to generate an island of reversed spins is Page 5 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

In the case of magnetic systems the parameter of rigidity J is known as the spin‐wave stiffness or the helicity modulus, and it is proportional to the superfluid density in the case of superfluids, the latter being discussed in Section 7.4.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 We have used several approximate estimates in the above discussion. It is possible to derive the same result rigorously by using Schwarz inequalities, as will be shown in the next section. 7.3 Mermin–Wagner theorem: Absence of spontaneous magnetization The Mermin‐Wagner theorem states that two‐dimensional short‐range interacting systems with continuous degrees of freedom and symmetries do not have spontaneous magnetization at finite temperatures. More generally, it is a statement relating the dimensionality of a system with continuous symmetry with the existence of the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We have made use of the spin‐wave approximation in the previous section, and the same conclusion is derived rigorously in the present section. The original theorem was given in the context of quantum spin systems, but we explain here a classical version since it is slightly simpler and does not need the introduction of quantum spin operators. A common physical mechanism, related to symmetry and fluctuations, lies behind the formal proofs both for quantum and classical systems. The quantum version of the theorem is proved in Appendix A.13. Although illuminating, the reader who is not interested in the details of the proof can skip this section.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 7.4 Kosterlitz–Thouless transition We have seen that the two‐dimensional XY model has no spontaneous magnetization (long‐range order) at finite temperatures and consequently has no ordinary (Landau‐ type) phase transition. This system is, nevertheless, known to have a special type of phase transition without long‐ range order. The low‐temperature phase does not display long‐range order but has clearly different correlation properties from the high‐ temperature paramagnetic phase. While correlation functions decay exponentially in the paramagnetic phase, they slowly decrease as a power law in the low‐ temperature phase (except at exactly T = 0 where there is long‐range order). This power‐law correlation is reminiscent of what happens at the critical point. An important difference from the usual critical point, though, is that this power‐law behavior extends over a finite temperature range. Sometimes this phase is referred to as a low‐temperature critical phase. Systems with power‐law decay of (potential) order parameter correlation functions are said to have quasi‐long‐range order. The XY model is at the lower critical dimension in two dimensions, and this fact causes such singular behavior. This special transition from quasi‐long‐range order to disorder is (p. 162 ) known as the Kosterlitz‐Thouless (KT) transition, and the critical phase is called the Kosterlitz‐Thouless (KT) phase.7 Let us calculate the correlation function using the spin‐wave approximation, which is valid at low temperatures, to verify its power‐law behavior. The correlation function of the XY model is expressed as Page 13 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

In particular, vortex configurations, not taken into account in the spin‐wave approximation of the XY model, gradually affect the state of the system, eventually destroying the quasi‐long‐ range order. To express configurations with vortices, we write the angle field variable ϕ(r) as a function of the angle θ measured from the x‐axis as ϕ(r)=n θ + c, with n an integer known as the winding number (a topological invariant) and c a constant, Fig. 7.3. Then, the derivative of the angle variable ∇ϕ appearing in the spin‐wave Hamiltonian (7.4) has as radial and azimuthal components as Page 15 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 (7.36) For the temperature range T # T KT = π J/2, the creation of vortices causes a free‐energy decrease. We therefore conclude that a phase transition takes place at T c = T KT, above which a large number of vortices proliferate and the spin‐wave approximation breaks down. For T # T KT, the angle variable around a vortex changes very quickly invalidating the spin‐wave approximation, and the relative angle between spins far apart are correlated only very weakly. Then, the quasi‐long‐range order is destroyed and the system becomes paramagnetic. This is the Kosterlitz‐Thouless (KT) transition. The low‐temperature region below T KT with quasi long‐range order is the KT phase. In the KT phase the creation of a vortex increases the free energy, and a single vortex is not stable. Nevertheless, a pair of vortices with different signs of their winding number n may be stable if the distance between them is not too large. To show this result we assume that several vortices exist around the origin. Then, the angle field far from the origin is written as, instead of eqn (7.33), Page 16 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

This implies that this term is irrelevant in the temperature range T p # T # T KT where the KT phase is realized. On the other hand, this term is relevant for T # T p and the system has the same properties as the clock model in which the angles assume only discrete values ϕ i = 2πk/p (k = 0,1, 2, …, p − 1).

The reason is that eqn (7.32) implies that η = T/2πJ, proportional to the ratio between T and J, has the value 1/4 at the transition point because T KT = π J/2. The relation η(T KT)=1/4 is often used to check if a transition belongs to the same universality class as the KT transition. 7.5 Interaction energy of vortex pairs We have learned that a vortex pair can exist in a stable manner around the origin if the neutrality condition is satisfied. The physical properties of vortices are better understood when we study the energy of vortices in their general configurations. In the following we will establish a connection between the XY model and a neutral Coulomb gas in two dimensions with charges n i, such that Σi n i = 0.

Physical intuition is useful to find the relevant variables, and we eventually write renormalization group equations for these variables. The temperature is clearly the most important variable. The corresponding scaling field x is chosen as x = 2 − πK(= 2 − πJ/T) such that it vanishes at the fixed point.8 The variable x is actually not relevant but marginal. In conventional critical phenomena, the temperature variable is relevant and renormalizes toward zero if the initial value is below the critical point, as illustrated in Fig. 1.5. However, in the KT transition, there is no isolated fixed point and all temperatures below the critical point are attracted to corresponding points on a fixed line, which represents a set of fixed points. The KT transition point does not correspond to an unstable fixed point characteristic of a relevant scaling field. Nevertheless, the temperature is not irrelevant but is marginal. Another important variable to take into consideration is the number of vortices. If there are few vortices, the spin‐wave approximation describes the system qualitatively faithfully and the system is in the KT phase. As the number of vortices increases, the slow and smooth change of angles, as assumed in the spin‐wave approximation, is not respected and the angles vary quickly near vortices, eventually leading to the KT transition into the paramagnetic phase. It is therefore reasonable to introduce as a relevant variable the chemical potential μ of vortices, which controls the number of vortices, or equivalently the fugacity obtained by exponentiating the chemical potential, y 0 = e−βμ. For small y 0 (large chemical potential) the number of vortices (p. 168 ) is small and the system is in the KT phase, whereas the paramagnetic phase has a large y 0 with very many vortices. This means that we have to see whether the fugacity increases or decreases under a renormalization group transformation.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Moreover, we are interested in whether or not the number of vortices increases by a renormalization group transformation. These aspects justify keeping only the lowest‐order term in the Taylor expansion of the right‐hand side of the renormalization group equation (beta function) in powers of x and y. Since vortices show up as pairs in the KT phase, the (p. 169 ) second‐ order term is the lowest‐order one in the variable y. As will be shown later, the renormalization group equation for x is readily written only in terms of this effect,10 Page 22 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 7.4 Renormalization group flow of the Kosterlitz equations. The dashed line represents the bare XY model before renormalization. The small black dot on this line is the KT transition point written in terms of the bare coupling. Since the KT transition point is at x = y = 0, the solution corresponding to the transition point has a vanishing constant on the right‐hand side of eqn (7.54). This means that the line y = ±x/a should go through the transition point on the xy plane. The renormalization group flow is drawn in Fig. 7.4. Within the KT phase, the spin‐ wave approximation captures the essence of the relevant physics and vortices do not play an essential role, irrelevant in the renormalization group sense, and hence y is renormalized to 0. This is the situation to the left of the line y = −x/a in Fig. 7.4. In the paramagnetic phase y renormalizes to larger and larger values, as in the region to the right of the line y = −x/a. These considerations lead to the renormalization group flow illustrated in Fig. 7.4. On the low‐temperature side, the KT phase, y is renormalized to 0 and x is to a finite value that corresponds to the initial (bare) value, and the system is attracted to the fixed line y* = 0, x # 0. On the high‐temperature side, the paramagnetic phase, y increases indefinitely and more and more vortices are created as the renormalization group process goes on. The line y = −x/a separates these two phases and is known as a separatrix. (p. 170 ) We have seen that the scaling field y is related to the fugacity y 0 and the chemical potential μ for vortices by the relation y = y 0e−βEc/2 = e−βμ−βEc/2. These quantities, fugacity and chemical potential, have been introduced artificially to study the situation with a small number of vortices and do not exist in the original XY model. The original problem corresponds to μ = 0 or y 0 = 1, and hence the bare couplings lie on the curve y = e−βEc/2 drawn as a dashed line in Fig. 7.4. This figure shows that the value of x increases toward a slightly larger value on the line y = 0, x # 0 after renormalization Page 23 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 even within the KT phase (to the left of the line y = −x/a). Correspondingly the temperature is also renormalized to a larger value. The fixed line is reached after many steps of the renormalization group transformation, and the dashed line of the original system itself is not invariant under renormalization. It should also be noticed that the fixed‐point condition x* = 0 (T = T kt = πJ/2) representing the KT transition point is to be described by the renormalized temperature. The transition temperature in terms of the original variable is at the crossing point of the line y = −x/a and the dashed curve, the small black dot in Fig. 7.4. Since this crossing point has x # 0, the KT transition temperature in terms of the original variable is smaller than πJ/2. We next study the singularities of physical quantities near the transition point using the solution of the Kosterlitz equations. Since x 2 − a 2 y 2 = 0 at the transition point, we will have x 2 − a 2 y 2 = −ct (t = (T − T KT)/T KT, c # 0) slightly above the transition point.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Those peculiar exponential singularities in the correlation function and specific heat reflect the lower critical dimension (two) of the XY model. As seen in (p. 172 ) Section 3.6.3, similar exponential singularities are shared by the Ising model at its lower critical dimension d = 1 near the transition point T = 0. 7.7 Lattice gauge theory and Elitzur's theorem In this section we digress from the main topic of KT transition and discuss the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in systems with local (gauge) symmetry. The theorem of Mermin and Wagner claims that continuous global symmetries do not break down spontaneously in two or lower dimensions. The same is true for discrete global symmetries in one dimension. We show in the present section that there exist no spontaneous symmetry breaking in any dimensions for local symmetries. This result contrasts the difference between global and local symmetries. For this purpose we analyze the lattice gauge theory, which has been introduced to understand the mechanism of confinement of quarks. Although the physical motivation is different, some models in the lattice gauge theory show phase transitions, whose properties are controlled by the symmetry and dimensionality of the system, similarly to conventional spin systems. 7.7.1 Lattice gauge theory Symmetries of a physical system can be classified into global or local (gauge) depending on the character of the transformation realizing the mathematical mapping.11 For example, in the conventional Ising model, one needs to change the sign of all spins (S i → −S i, ∀i) to realize the global ℤ2 discrete symmetry of the model. The same happens in the XY model, where all angle variables need to be transformed by the same amount (ϕ i → ϕ i + α, ∀i) to realize the global U(1) continuous symmetry12 On the other hand, there are models where transforming only some degrees of freedom is enough to achieve invariance. A gauge theory is defined by a Hamiltonian or action, classical or quantum, that is invariant under a local or gauge transformation. It can be defined on a lattice or in the continuum, e.g. as a field theory. According to the gauge principle adopted widely in field theory, all fundamental physical interactions in nature arise from actions or Hamiltonians that are invariant under local transformations. The primary motivation to study lattice gauge theories is to provide a non‐perturbative approach for the standard theory of strong interactions in high‐energy Page 26 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

This is well beyond the scope of this book, and we will only concentrate on some of the aspects of critical phenomena in classical models of the lattice gauge theory. Fig. 7.5 The product of four spins on bonds around a plaquette constitutes the basic interaction B ◻ in the Z 2 gauge theory. Fig. 7.6 The signs of spin variables on bonds emanating from a site ℐ are changed. This is a local, gauge transformation and keeps the Hamiltonian invariant. An example of a classical model that displays discrete gauge symmetries is the ℤ2 lattice gauge theory, also known as the Z 2 gauge theory or the Ising lattice gauge theory. Consider Ising spins S i = ±1 that reside on the bonds i,13 and not on the vertices (sites), of a three‐dimensional cubic lattice.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 The presence of local (gauge) invariance has important physical consequences. One of those consequences is Elitzur's theorem, which states that non‐gauge‐invariant (or gauge‐variant) local physical quantities cannot exhibit spontaneous breaking of gauge (p. 175 ) symmetries, discrete or continuous, in any dimensions. This does not imply that a phase transition, signaled as a singularity in the free energy, cannot occur, as we will see in the example of the three‐dimensional Z 2 gauge theory below. Therefore, the expectation value of a gauge‐variant quantity cannot be used as a Landau‐type local order parameter to describe such a phase transition. Since symmetry breaking of local quantities is precluded, differences in the behavior of correlation functions in different phases have to manifest themselves in non‐local quantities written in terms of the original local degrees of freedom. We now prove Elitzur's theorem. The essence of the proof is as follows. Consider the absolute value of the average of any local quantity f(ϕ i) (involving only a finite number of fields or variables {ϕ i} like S i), which is bounded and non‐invariant under a gauge symmetry group # of a Hamiltonian H (such as ℤ2 in the Z 2 gauge theory). This ǀ#f(ϕ i))ǀ is shown to be bounded from above by the absolute mean value of the same quantity computed for a zero‐dimensional Hamiltonian H̄ (i.e. it involves a finite number of degrees of freedom) which is globally invariant under # and preserves the range of the interactions. This upper bound is shown to vanish in the zero‐field limit after the thermodynamic limit due to the local character of the symmetry. More explicitly, to determine if spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, we evaluate Page 30 of 34 Kosterlitz—Thouless transition PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

A similar idea was proposed by V. L. Berezinskii in Sov. Phys. JETP 34 (1972) 610. (8) Strictly speaking, a fixed point should be distinguished from a critical point. Thus, K appearing here is not the interaction constant before renormalization K = J/T (bare coupling) but is the variable after many steps of renormalization (renormalized coupling). The difference between these two concepts will be explained in more detail later. (9) The scaling fields of the two‐dimensional XY model are often written as x and y for historical reasons. This notation may be confused with the scaling dimension or the exponent of the renormalization group eigenvalue. In this book we write υ x and υ y for the scaling dimension and exponent, respectively, of the vortex numbers. Do not confuse this notation with the Cartesian components of the velocity field υ of the previous section. (10) Do not confuse the constant a of this section with the lattice constant.

The present chapter studies the effects of randomness on phase transitions and critical phenomena. Although randomness may seem to obscure singular behaviour such as divergence of physical quantities at the critical temperature, it is established that well-defined phase transitions exist as long as randomness is not too strong, but the critical behaviour may get modified with respect to the pure sample. After the introduction of basic concepts and methods such as self- averaging and replica method, it is elucidated what type of phase transitions exist in the random-field Ising model and the SK model of spin glasses. Also explained are the percolation transitions using the fractal structure and the Potts model.

We will show what phase transitions exist under the influence of randomness. 8.1 Random fields Hamiltonians describing phase transitions and critical phenomena usually consist of interaction and field terms. These are competing relevant terms, in the sense of renormalization group, that determine the values of the exponents y t and y h. The most basic model does not have other relevant operators. It follows that the effects of randomness can be studied by its influences on those two terms. The present section treats the field term with randomness. The randomness in interactions will be discussed in the next section.

It, nevertheless, turns out that a randomly diluted antiferromagnet under uniform field and fluids in random, porous media in their lattice‐gas representation are examples that are well described by the random‐field Ising model. 8.1.1 Quenched system and self‐averaging The time scale for the change of randomness in fields is usually much longer than that of thermal fluctuations. For example, when randomness comes from the random mixture of magnetic and non‐magnetic atoms, the positions of atoms do not change within the experimental time scale but the orientation of spins changes quickly. The corresponding theoretical framework is first to generate a set {h i} from the distribution function P(h i) and then apply the usual statistical‐mechanical prescription to calculate the free energy and other physical quantities for the given fixed values of {h i}. Randomness with this property is called quenched randomness, and the corresponding system is named a quenched system. In contrast, if the degrees of freedom of randomness change in a similar time scale as that of microscopic degrees of freedom, the system is called an annealed system.2 We treat quenched systems that correspond to most experimental situations. It is difficult to calculate the free energy explicitly as a function of the quenched randomness of {h i}, i.e. N variables h 1,…, h N. Fortunately, it turns out, in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞, that many physical quantities including the free energy do not depend upon the values of fields {h i} themselves but only on the distribution function P(h i) as eqns (8.2) and (8.3). This fact is called the self‐averaging property. Page 4 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com). (c) Copyright Oxford University Press, 2012.

Vanishing of this coefficient means a tricritical point as elucidated in Section 2.4. A further increase of h 0 beyond the tricritical point causes a first‐order transition.

We mainly give an account of the mean‐field theory in the present section with some comments on finite‐dimensional cases in the last part. The discussions on quenched randomness and self‐averaging properties of Section 8.1.1 also apply to spin glasses without modifications. 8.2.1 Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model The Sherrington‐Kirkpatrick model (SK model) is the infinite‐range version of the Edwards–Anderson model, and a mean‐field theory of spin glasses has been developed for the SK model. Since the infinite‐range model is known to give the same results as the mean‐field theory for the ferromagnetic system, we expect that the SK model may be regarded as the mean‐field model of spin glasses, since for the latter a direct mean‐field approximation is not easy to formulate. The SK model has the following Hamiltonian, Page 16 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com). (c) Copyright Oxford University Press, 2012.

The dashed line is the erroneous boundary between the spin glass and ferromagnetic phases suggested by the replica‐symmetric solution. The correct phase boundaries are drawn in full lines. Failure of the replica symmetric solution at low temperatures can be verified by calculating the entropy from the free energy (8.29) for J 0 = 0. It turns out that the entropy is negative at low temperatures. The entropy is the logarithm of the number of possible states and should be positive or zero in systems with discrete degrees of freedom like the Ising model with or without randomness. (p. 191 ) 8.2.3 Systems in finite spatial dimensions Let us estimate the upper critical dimension to confirm how far the mean‐ field predictions can be trusted in more realistic systems in finite spatial dimensions. We assume J 0 = 0, and consequently m = 0, to exclude the effects of ferromagnetic order to focus our attention on the spin glass phase. Expansion of the free energy (8.29) in powers of q has a third‐order term, as suggested in eqn (8.36). This is in contrast to the infinite‐range model of the ferromagnetic system or the Landau theory in which the next term to m 2 was m 4. The symmetry of the free energy with respect to the inversion of magnetization, f(m) = f(−m), meant that f(m) is an even function and does not have odd powers in its expansion. The spin glass order parameter, on the other hand, is the average of the square of #S i# and is always positive, and Page 20 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 consequently the operation of sign inversion of the order parameter is not a proper symmetry of the system. Thus, there exist odd powers of q. The above symmetry consideration holds irrespective of the replica method, and the problem of replica symmetry breakdown does not change the conclusion. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the renormalization‐group exponent of the third‐order term of the order parameter to study the stability of the Gaussian fixed point, which gives the mean‐field exponent, following the prescription described in Section 4.2.1. It turns out that the same invariance argument as in Section 4.2.1 applied to the third‐order term leads to the exponent y υ = 3 − d/2 for the coefficient υ of the third‐ order term. This result means that the third‐order term is irrelevant for d # 6 and the mean‐field description given by the Gaussian model is stable against the non‐Gaussian perturbation. This suggests that the upper critical dimension is six. exercise 8.3 Confirm that the value of the exponent of the third‐order term is y υ = 3 − d/2 from invariance of the Hamiltonian under a change of scale. The lower critical dimension is much harder to estimate than the upper critical dimension. There is no known simple theory like the Imry‐Ma argument because the (p. 192 ) stability criterion of a spatially uniform ordered state does not apply to the spin glass problem. It is, nevertheless, believed mainly from numerical calculations that the lower critical dimension is somewhere between two and three. The relevance of randomness as a perturbation to a non‐random system can be studied following the method of Section 8.1.5. To see the relevance of random interactions, it is useful to separate the Hamiltonian into a non‐ random term H 0 and a random‐interaction term H 1, Page 21 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 and the above argument applies. Higher‐order terms have smaller exponents of the renormalization group. 8.3 Diluted ferromagnet and percolation In the previous section we studied the effects of random interactions with both positive and negative signs. There exist other types of randomness in which some of the interactions or some spins vanish. For instance, some of the magnetic atoms may be replaced by non‐magnetic atoms because of the effect of artificial mixing of magnetic and non‐magnetic materials. These substances are called diluted ferromagnets. We explain the case of site dilution in the first part of this section, most of which applies to bond dilution as well. In the former case, spins in some of the sites disappear, whereas in the latter there are no interactions on some of the bonds. The bond dilution case will be described in the last part of this section. Phase transitions in diluted ferromagnets at zero temperature will be shown to be related to the geometrical phase transition called percolation. 8.3.1 Diluted ferromagnet A diluted ferromagnet has a ferromagnetic phase as its only ordered state at low temperatures, in contrast to spin glasses.8 Let us be more concrete and assume that a given site is occupied by a spin (magnetic moment) with probability p and unoccupied with probability 1 − p, independently of other sites. As p decreases from unity, the ferromagnetic phase become unstable and disappears completely below a critical value p c, as depicted in Fig. 8.5. The Harris criterion applies to the present case. The randomness, dilution, is relevant in the renormalization group sense if the specific heat exponent is positive, α # 0, for the non‐random (non‐diluted) system (p = 1). Then, the critical behavior changes from the non‐random case. Page 23 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 8.5 Phase diagram of a diluted ferromagnet. The probability that a site is occupied by a spin is denoted as p. Arrows represent the flow of parameters by the renormalization group. The blank square is the projection of the random fixed point onto the two‐dimensional p−T plane, which controls the critical phenomena along the phase boundary. The renormalization‐group flow of parameters is shown schematically in Fig. 8.5. The critical point of the non‐random system at (p = 1, T = T c) is unstable along the temperature axis. If α # 0, the same point is also unstable along the horizontal direction that decreases p from unity. In this case, there exists a random fixed point that controls the critical behavior of the diluted ferromagnet at some intermediate values of p and T, as indicated by a blank square in Fig. 8.5. To state it more accurately more and more new types of parameters emerge as the renormalization steps proceed, and consequently the renormalization flow cannot be drawn on the two‐dimensional phase diagram. The random fixed point is located in a multidimensional space away from the plane of Fig. 8.5, which is projected onto this figure as a blank square. There (p. 194 ) is no special critical point on the plane of Fig. 8.5 itself. This is a feature different from the tricritical point of Fig. 8.2.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Fig. 8.6 An example of percolation. Occupied sites are denoted by black circles. Four small clusters are encircled by dotted lines. Another large cluster percolates from the top to the bottom. Fig. 8.7 A cluster of size four in one dimension. Occupied sites are drawn in black and unoccupied sites in white. The structure of the diagram of Fig. 8.5 suggests that there can be another unstable fixed point at zero temperature. The point marked p c on the p‐axis is this fixed point. The transition at this point along the p‐axis is called the percolation transition, which is a geometric transition. Ising spins all align parallel in the ground state and do not play a role in the determination of the system properties. The percolation transition, nevertheless, happens because the size of the clusters drastically changes at p c. A cluster is a set of occupied sites connected by bonds. Assume that a bond exists between neighboring occupied sites. In Fig. 8.6, there are four small clusters and a single large cluster percolating from the top end of the system to the bottom. (p. 195 ) When the probability p of site occupancy is larger than the threshold p c, large clusters of macroscopic size connect boundaries of the system. Strictly speaking, a cluster percolates if and only if it is of infinite size. For p smaller than p c, only finite‐size clusters can exist. A percolation transition occurs at the point where a drastic change between these different states takes place.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Ising spins on clusters all point to a single direction, up state (S i = 1), at zero temperature under infinitesimally small but positive field. Thus, the sum of sizes of clusters is given by Σ′i S i, where the sum runs over all occupied sites. This means that the magnetization of a diluted ferromagnet at zero temperature is closely related with the sizes of the clusters. In the thermodynamic limit, where the system size tends to infinity, finite‐size clusters do not contribute to the magnetization per site. Therefore, the magnetization per site agrees with the probability P that a site belongs to an infinite‐size cluster. The probability P decreases as p decreases and vanishes for p ≤ p c. As will be shown below, many other quantities also show singular behavior at p c. This phenomenon can be analyzed in a theoretical framework similar to the one developed in previous chapters if we replace T − T c by p − p c. Percolation is a geometrical concept related to configurations of sites and bonds, independent of magnetic properties of spins on occupied sites. The theory of percolation has been applied to many fields including the spread of forest fire and the search for crude oil in strata. 8.3.2 Scaling in a percolation transition The number of finite‐size clusters, with the size variable denoted as s, plays an important role in the theory of percolation transitions. As a simple example, let us consider the probability that a cluster of size four exists in one dimension, as in Fig. 8.7. The probability that four consecutive sites are occupied is p 4, and the probability that sites neighboring to the left and right of the four‐site cluster (shown in white in Fig. 8.7) are both unoccupied is (1 − p)2. The number of ways to place this cluster on a one‐dimensional chain of size L is equal to the number of ways to put the left‐most site on the chain, which is approximately L. If we ignore the boundary effects by considering an asymptotically infinitely long chain, the above number is indeed L. Then, the total number of size‐four clusters is Lp 4(1−p)2, which we write as n 4(p) =p 4(1 − p)2, where n 4(p) is the number of size‐four clusters divided by the number of sites L. Clearly, for general s, we have the cluster number density Page 26 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 (p. 196 ) The probability that a given site belongs to a cluster of size s is sn s (p) since the site under consideration may be any one of the s occupied sites in a cluster. It is difficult to write the expression of n s(p) for arbitrary s in higher dimensions. Various types of clusters may exist, and it is impossible to list all of them for large s. We therefore do not try to derive the explicit form of n s(p) and instead estimate its asymptotic form for large clusters s≫ 1 as these large clusters should play dominant roles in the critical phenomena around p ≈ p c. Our goal is to reveal the asymptotic behavior of n s (p) for p close to p c and very large s. An analogy with the usual thermal critical phenomena suggests to assume the following scaling law, Page 27 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 The same relation as above holds also for p # p c if we consider finite‐size clusters only, excluding infinite clusters, and see the rate of divergence of the size of finite clusters. We write γ for the exponent of the divergence of S because S is proportional to the susceptibility of a diluted ferromagnet in the low‐temperature limit. When the temperature is close to zero, almost all Ising spins in a cluster are oriented in the same direction and so a cluster can be regarded as a single isolated spin that takes values ±s. Thus, the magnetization of a cluster of size s is stanh(βsh) if the external field h is of the same order of magnitude as the temperature (so that βh is of order one). The total magnetization of the system is the sum of these contributions from clusters. For p # p c, all clusters are of finite size, and the magnetization is Page 29 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 8.3.3 Fractal dimension and hyperscaling The scaling law (8.44) may look similar to the finite‐size scaling (3.98) of conventional critical phenomena. The variable t = (T − T c)/T c corresponds to p − p c and the length scale L would correspond to the cluster size s. This identification, however, is not necessarily correct. The size s is the number of sites in a cluster, which is different from the linear size of a cluster. As the typical linear size of a cluster is the correlation length ξ, it is necessary to relate the correlation length with the size s. The starting point of the discussion is the definitions of the correlation function G(r) and the correlation length ξ. The correlation function is the probability that a site B at a distance r from a given occupied site A belongs to the same cluster as A. A very simplified example is that all sites are occupied inside a circle of radius a from site A and all sites are unoccupied outside of the same circle. Then, the correlation function from A is G(r) = 1 for r # a and G(r) = 0 for r # a. This example should be sufficient to convince the reader that the expectation value of the size of a cluster S is the sum of G(r) over all r, Page 30 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 (8.61) between the regions of large and small z(= (p − p c)s σ) in eqn (8.44) is related to the length ξ at which the correlation function G(r) starts to decay significantly. Indeed, the change of s from values giving ǀzǀ = ǀ(p − p c)s σ ǀ smaller than unity to values giving large ǀzǀ has the same effect on n s(p) as the change of p (with fixed s) from values near p c to values far from p c. The system then moves from a region close to the critical point to a region far from criticality, the borderline being at ǀzǀ ≈ 1. If we observe a cluster with a much smaller length scale than the correlation length ξ, this correlation length looks very large and the system seems as if it were in the critical region (ǀzǀ ≪ 1). If, on the other hand, the standard of length to observe the cluster is much larger than the correlation length ξ, the finiteness of ξ is clearly recognized and the system is regarded as being outside the critical region (ǀzǀ ≫ 1). Consequently, the s 0 corresponding to ǀzǀ = 1 would be identified with the cluster size (the number of sites in the cluster) where such a qualitative change of the system behavior takes place, namely the size of a cluster of linear length ξ. At p c, a finite‐size cluster has a very complicated structure, very different from a simple sphere, characterized by a fractal dimension D. Discussions in the previous paragraph indicate that s 0 has a linear size ξ with a fractal dimension D defined by Page 31 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Let us now consider the upper critical dimension and the mean‐field theory for percolation. It is useful to check the relevance of non‐quadratic terms of the Landau free energy, generalized to have a spatial dependence of the order parameter, around the Gaussian fixed point. The Potts model does not have a symmetry under inversion of spin variables except for the special case of the Ising model with q = 2. Hence, the Landau free energy has both even and odd terms. Consequently, a correction to the quadratic term begins with a cubic term, for which the borderline dimension of relevance is six, as was discussed for the spin glass problem in Section 8.2.3. We conclude that the upper critical dimension is six for percolation. The mean‐field critical exponent for d # 6 can be estimated easily from the properties of the Gaussian fixed point. As was mentioned in Section 4.2.1, critical exponents for the Gaussian fixed point satisfy Page 36 of 37 Random systems PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The change of orientation of neighboring spins Δθ is of the order of L −1 since the orientation changes by π in the length L. Then, the increase in the interaction energy from the perfectly ferromagnetic state Δ θ = 0 is J cos Δθ − Jcos0 ≈ #(L −2) for a neighboring pair of spins. This energy increase exists approximately uniformly over the area of L d, giving the total energy increase #(L d−2).

These examples nevertheless play important roles in many aspects including the verification of the accuracy of approximation theories such as the mean-field theory and renormalization group. Mathematical methods to solve such examples are interesting in their own right and constitute an important subfield of mathematical physics. In particular the exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model occupies an outstanding status as one of the founding studies of the modern theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena. The present chapter shows simple but typical examples of exact solutions of classical spin systems such as the one-dimensional Ising model with various boundary conditions, the n-vector model, the spherical model, the one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model, and the two-dimensional Ising model. An account on the Yang-Lee theory will also be given as a set of basic rigorous results on phase transitions.

We elucidate in the present chapter simple but typical examples of exact solutions such as the one‐ dimensional classical spin system, the spherical model, the one‐dimensional quantum XY model and the two‐dimensional Ising model. An account of the Yang‐Lee theory on the zeros of the partition function will also be given as a set of basic rigorous results on phase transitions. 9.1 One‐dimensional Ising model We have already studied the one‐dimensional Ising model in the context of a real‐space renormalization group. It is, nevertheless, illuminating to explain the well‐established method of its solution here partly because the solution of the two‐dimensional Ising model is closely related to some aspects of the one‐dimensional solution. Also, it is one of those exactly solvable models where the independence of thermodynamic quantities on the boundary conditions, in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞, can be rigorously established. We will study the free and periodic boundary conditions cases. 9.1.1 Free boundary condition The Hamiltonian of the one‐dimensional Ising model at zero field, h = 0, under free boundary conditions reads Page 3 of 42 Exact solutions and related topics PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The critical exponents are functions of d in the range 2 # d # 4, whereas the same exponents take the mean‐ field values above four dimensions d # 4. At d = 4 critical exponents coincide with the mean‐field results but with logarithmic corrections. The n‐vector model in the limit n → ∞ has been studied in detail due to these notable properties expected for more conventional systems with finite n, which include the existence of upper and lower critical dimensions and the d dependence of critical exponents between the upper and lower critical dimensions. The free energy of the n‐vector model in the limit n → ∞ is known to be identical to a model called the spherical model.

It is also clear that H(u) has no singularities at any positive u. Hence, u as the solution of H(u) = 2K is an analytic function of K and ƒ(u) is not singular as a function of K. Thus, the system does not undergo a phase transition for d ≤ 2. (ii) 2 # d # 4. As seen in eqn (9.67), H(u) tends to a finite value as u → 0 for 2 # d # 4. The first‐order derivative of H(u), however, diverges as u → 0.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Consequently, the specific heat does not diverge for 2 # d # 4 since α # 0. The exponent α diverges as d → 2 and tends to vanish as d → 4. It is interesting to remember that α = 0 is the mean‐field value. Since u stays constant for K # K c, the temperature dependence of the free energy (9.65) exists only in the terms explicitly dependent on K. The second‐order derivative of this equation with h = 0 then shows that the specific heat is a constant. We therefore conclude that the specific heat has the temperature dependence as depicted in Fig. 9.5. A notable feature is that the specific heat stays finite as T → 0, similarly to the one‐dimensional n‐vector model, a problem specific to continuous classical systems. The susceptibility is the second‐order derivative of ƒ with respect to h and is therefore divergent, as follows according to eqn (9.65), Page 21 of 42 Exact solutions and related topics PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Exponents other than β and η diverge as d → 2, indicating that the rate of divergence is larger than power laws at the lower critical dimension. This (p. 219 ) is in agreement with the strong exponential divergence observed in the two‐dimensional XY model and the one‐dimensional Ising model. (iii) d ≥ 4. Since H(u) = H(0) − cu as u ≈ 0 above four dimensions, we can apply the discussions for 2 # d # 4 to the present case simply by setting d → 4. It of course means that the mean‐field theory gives the exact values for the critical exponents. At d = 4, logarithmic corrections appear, reflecting the logarithmic divergence of physical quantities. exercise 9.3 Show that the spherical model does not have a phase transition in any dimension if h ≠ 0. A finite field erases a phase transition, as in Fig. 1.3. It will be useful to check if the saddle‐point equation (9.66) has a solution for arbitrary K and if the solution has a singularity. exercise 9.4 Evaluate the spontaneous magnetization of the spherical model near the transition point for 2 # d # 4. Differentiate eqn (9.65) with respect to h and eliminate u using eqn (9.66). 9.4 One‐dimensional quantum XY model The present book discusses topics of phase transitions and critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics. A main reason is that phase transitions and critical phenomena are macroscopic phenomena involving very many degrees of freedom and quantum effects, which usually appear prominently in microscopic length scales, do not play significant roles. Quantum fluctuations, nevertheless, become dominant at low temperatures, where thermal fluctuations become irrelevant, and phase transitions caused by quantum effects sometimes appear. We do not discuss quantum phase transitions in general. Nevertheless, one of the simplest examples of quantum spin systems, the one‐dimensional quantum XY model, will be studied in the present section. This model is interesting not just because the exact solution can be derived by relatively straightforward calculations but also since the solution has common aspects with the two‐dimensional Ising model to be discussed in the next section.

There have been a number of methods of solution proposed. In this section we explain the one that uses Majorana fields because it involves a relatively smaller amount of computation than other methods. 9.5.1 Construction of the transfer matrix It is convenient to reanalyze the transfer matrix method used for the one‐ dimensional Ising model as a preparation for the two‐dimensional case.

We now consider the two‐dimensional case in which the process of extending the system size, by adding columns one by one as in Fig. 9.9, is expressed by the operations V 1 (for the addition of interactions between two columns) and V 2 (for the addition of interactions within a column). We first notice that the addition of interactions between columns represented by horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 9.9 can be performed at each site independently of other sites. This operation of adding the interaction to the site neighboring to the right of a given site is exactly the same as in the transfer matrix for (p. 225 ) the one-dimensional model in Fig. 9.8.

As a consequence, the free energy per spin f is not singular in R in the thermodynamic limit. theorem 9.2[Circle theorem] Consider the Ising model with two-body ferromagnetic interactions. Zeros of its partition function all lie on the imaginary axis in the complex field h plane, or equivalently, on the unit circle in the plane of z = e−2β h. (p. 232 ) A proof of Theorem 9.1 is given in Appendix A.18. A proof of Theorem 9.2 is more complicated and we refer the interested reader to the original paper.8 Theorem 9.1 justifies the naive conjecture that the singularity of the free energy is caused by the zeros of the partition function. Theorem 9.2 holds only for models with two-body ferromagnetic interactions, but the interaction strengths need not be translationally invariant in Theorem 9.2, as long as they are ferromagnetic. To see the significance of Theorem 9.2, it is convenient to write the partition function Z as a function of z = e−2β h to see that Z is essentially a polynomial of z, Page 39 of 42 Exact solutions and related topics PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Duality Hidetoshi Nishimori, Gerardo Ortiz Abstract and Keywords Exact solutions of model systems are the most reliable source of information. However, there are not many model systems that can be exactly solved and, consequently, many approximate schemes such as series expansions have been developed. It is sometimes possible, though, to extract exact information without directly solving those model systems. Arguments using duality transformations make it possible to derive the exact location of the phase transition point and the exact value of the energy at the transition point when the model is self dual. Duality not only determines the exact location of the transition point of the two-dimensional Ising model and related models but also is useful to rewrite the $XY$ model into a different form, the Villain model and its dual, which reveals new physical aspects of the system. Classical and quantum dualities can be related by certain mappings and Fourier transformation is at the root of such deep results.

These remarkable results can be obtained by much simpler arguments than the direct solutions. Duality not only determines the exact location of the transition point of the two‐dimensional Ising model and related models but also is useful to rewrite the XY model into a different form, which reveals new physical aspects of the system. 10.1 Classical duality Duality in classical statistical mechanics usually means a transformation that relates the partition functions of two distinct model systems under the replacement of the value of temperature by another value. When the two model systems involved are the same, the duality transformation is known as self‐duality. Self‐dualities are mappings between the high‐ and low‐ temperature phases of the model that allow us, for instance, to determine the location of the phase transition point when there is a unique singularity in the free energy. It is convenient to write the partition function, a function of K = J/T, as Z(K). If we write the conclusion first, the duality for the two‐dimensional Ising model on the square lattice with periodic boundaries without external field means that the partition function satisfies the following relation Page 3 of 33 Duality PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 In the thermodynamic limit N → ∞, the function log Z/N has a singularity at the phase transition point as this quantity is essentially equal to the free energy. Equation (10.4) indicates that, if the left‐hand side is singular at K c, so is the right‐hand side at K*(K c). Then, if it happens that K c ≠ K*(K c), the function limN→∞ log Z(K)/N is singular at K c and K*(K c), two different singular points. Therefore, we conclude that K c = K*(K c) as long as the system is singular at a unique transition point.

To write the result first, a graphical representation of the low‐ temperature expansion has exactly the same set of graphs as in the high‐temperature expansion. This makes it possible to find a one‐to‐one correspondence between the terms of the two types of series expansions. We can then equate the partition functions written in terms of tanh K (high‐ temperature expansion) and of e−2K (low‐temperature expansion), the latter being the small parameter of the low‐temperature expansion, leading to the duality relation of eqn (10.1).

Series expansions are often formulated not for the partition function but for its logarithm, the free energy, and its derivatives like the susceptibility. Although it is often difficult to evaluate the coefficients of high‐order terms of an expansion, methods to extrapolate the result of finite‐order calculations to infinite order have been developed and have turned out to be powerful tools to estimate the critical points and critical exponents. Types of graphs in these expansions of the free energy and its derivatives are known to be a little different from the present case of the partition function. exercise 10.1 Determine the coefficient of the sixth‐order term (tanh K)6 in the high‐temperature expansion of the partition function of the Ising model on the square lattice.

A shaded plaquette corresponds to a bond drawn bold in Fig. 10.3 and carries the weight tanh K. where N p is the total number of plaquettes. Similarly to the high‐ temperature expansion of the usual Ising model, the spin variables should appear an even number of times if the summation over the spin values {S i = ±1} is to give a non‐vanishing contribution. Since spins are located on bonds, this constraint for finite contributions (p. 243 ) requires any bond to appear an even number of times in the expansion of the product of eqn (10.22). In two dimensions, the expansion of eqn (10.22) can be expressed by graphs of the type of Fig. 10.3, where each plaquette inside the closed bold lines represents a factor S j S k S l S m tanh K. Spin variables are located on all bold lines of the diagrams and thus the summation over their values, ±1, gives zero. Spin variables on bonds inside a closed graph (written as thin lines in Fig. 10.3) appear twice, yielding Page 13 of 33 Duality PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

The left graph of Fig. 10.5, for instance, corresponds to a down spin at the center of the cube surrounded by up spins everywhere else (dual lattice). In general, the sites of the dual Ising model are located at the centers of the (p. 244 ) cubes. The right graph, similarly, has two down spins inside the closed object in the corresponding low‐temperature expansion of the Ising model. The analogy with the correspondence between the high‐ and low‐temperature expansions of Fig. 10.4 should be clear. We thus conclude that the partition functions of the three‐dimensional Z 2 gauge theory and of the usual Ising model are related by a duality relation similar to eqns (10.1) and (10.3) but with different partition functions on the two sides of the equality and with 3N bonds. In other words, the Ising and Z 2 gauge theory models in three dimensions are not self‐dual models. Since the three‐dimensional Ising model has a phase transition at finite temperature, i.e. a singularity in the free energy, it readily follows that the three‐dimensional Z 2 gauge theory also undergoes a phase transition at finite temperature. 10.3 Duality by Fourier transformation The graphical derivation of duality relations is intuitively appealing and relatively easy to understand, but it is not straightforward to generalize to models other than the Ising model. Another formulation based on Fourier transformation, albeit a little abstract, is more suitable to apply systematically to a wide class of model systems including the Ising model. We explain this method in the present section. 10.3.1 General form of the partition function Suppose that a spin variable ξ i(= 1,2, …q) is assigned to site i.

Derive a relation between the critical exponents above and below the transition temperature, α ±, the former for the triangular lattice and the latter for the hexagonal lattice. Do the same for the critical amplitudes, A ±. Notice that the triangular lattice is dual to the hexagonal lattice and vice versa. See Fig. 10.8. exercise 10.5 Let us determine the transition point of the Ising model on the triangular lattice by the introduction of a star—triangle transformation in combination with the duality relation. If Z(K) on the left‐hand side of eqn (10.40) is the partition function for the triangular lattice, then Z*(K*) on the right‐hand side is the partition function for the hexagonal lattice. Since the function Z is different from Z*, the duality relation (10.40) is insufficient to identify a unique singularity. We can, nevertheless, reduce the Ising model on the hexagonal lattice to the Ising model on a triangular lattice by taking a partial trace, as depicted in Fig. 10.9, from which the (dual) partition function for the Ising model on the hexagonal lattice is transformed to the partition function of another Ising model on the triangular lattice, Z(K̃). In combination with the duality relation, we then have a relation connecting the Ising models on triangular lattices, which allows us to apply the argument in Section 10.1 and identify the fixed point with the singularity.

The Villain model has both vortex and spin‐wave excitations and consequently has a KT phase similarly to the XY model. Since the Villain model is essentially the same as the XY model in its properties concerning the phase transition, but is easier to analyze than the XY model itself, the theory of the KT transition is often developed for the Villain model instead of the XY model. The second half of Chapter 7 was essentially for the Villain model.

This is the dual representation of the Villain model. Since eqn (10.44) is written in terms of discrete variables in contrast to the original representation of the Villain model (10.42) or the XY model, the system is not self‐dual even on the square lattice. The dual representation of the Villain model (10.44) may be regarded as a solid‐on‐ solid (SOS) model of roughening transitions, in which the surface of a solid suddenly changes its smoothness at a transition temperature. Suppose that μ i atoms stack up at lattice site i on the surface of a solid. It is reasonable to assume that a site with a higher stack is unstable. This fact is expressed by writing the energy as (μ i ‐ μ j)2, which is higher for larger differences of neighboring heights. The partition function (10.44) corresponds to this model. The Villain model has a KT transition and the free energy shows a singularity there. The dual representation (10.44) implies that there exists a roughening transition in the corresponding model of solid surfaces. For small K, the system is dominated by states with small (μ i − μ j)2 and the surface is smooth. As K grows, larger differences of height are likely to appear due to thermal fluctuations,12 and the surface suddenly roughens at the transition temperature. Let us return to the XY model. The dual representation of the Villain model (10.44) is of the same form as the spin‐wave approximation discussed in Section 7.2, if we disregard the discreteness of μ i. By taking into account this discreteness, we can derive the energy of vortices (7.48) of Section 7.5 as follows.

This is an Ising‐like discrete excitation, and therefore long‐range order exists at low temperatures, a smooth phase. In the limit of high temperature, on the other hand, we may approximate the discrete variable μ i by continuous values since the minimum change of (μ i − μ j)2/(2T r) is very small. (p. 253 ) Problem: Show in the high‐temperature phase that fluctuations of μ i diverge in the long‐range limit, which implies a rough surface. It will be useful to evaluate the expectation value of (μ i − μ i+r)2 and analyze its large‐r limit. 10.4 Quantum duality It has been shown in Exercise 9.8 that the transverse‐field Ising model in one dimension undergoes a quantum phase transition, i.e. a qualitative change of the ground‐state correlations, as the field strength h is varied. The critical properties of this transition are identical to those of the two‐dimensional classical Ising model where the control parameter is the temperature T. This fact suggests an essential equivalence between these two model systems. This is indeed the case, as can be shown by a quantum‐ classical mapping. Quantum dualities are unitary mappings between quantum Hamil‐ tonians that preserve the quasi‐local character of their interaction terms. In some cases, known as quantum self‐dualities, those mappings also conserve the form of the Hamiltonian operator. Physically through this mapping one relates the weak‐ coupling phase of the model to its strong‐coupling phase. Our goal in this section is first to prove a quantum duality indeed a self‐duality relation for the one‐dimensional transverse‐field Ising model, from which we can locate the quantum phase transition point. Secondly we show how classical and quantum dualities are simply related by a quantum‐ classical mapping. 10.4.1 Duality in the transverse‐field Ising chain Let us consider the transverse‐field Ising model on a chain with free boundary conditions, Page 26 of 33 Duality PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 We have in this way shown that quantum and classical dualities, which seem to have a different origin and physical interpretation, are mathematically related and represent two sides of the same entity. Notes: (1) The factor 2 in the denominator of the right‐hand side introduces a sort of asymmetry in the self‐dual relation, and is related to the particular periodic boundary conditions used in both spatial directions. Boundary effects play no role in the thermodynamic limit, N → ∞. (2) Hereafter, high‐ and low‐temperature series expansions will be called high‐ and low‐temperature expansions for simplicity. (3) Corrections are necessary if we use free boundary conditions. The number of unit squares is slightly smaller than the number of sites in such a case. We do not go into those details because we will be interested in the system behavior in the thermodynamic limit, N → ∞, in which boundary effects are expected to play no role. (4) The overall factor 2 is the one responsible for the asymmetry in eqn (10.2). (5) This part can be skipped on a first reading unless the reader is interested in the generalization of duality techniques to systems with many‐body interactions in higher dimensions. (6) It is not essential how to choose the sense of arrows. Nevertheless, it is useful to assign the sense systematically in order to keep the discussions transparent. (7) The lattice constant is chosen to be unity. (8) We are assuming periodic boundary conditions. (9) Equation (10.32) indicates that the x‐component of η, η i +x̂ i, is the difference of μ along the y‐axis, μ j − μ j−ŷ, and the y‐component of η, η i +ŷ i, is the minus sign of the difference of μ along the x‐axis, − (μ j − μj − ̂x). This is the discrete, or lattice, curl in two dimensions, the continuum limit of which is ∂y μ for the x‐component and —∂x μ for the y‐component of the vector η, and hence the field is divergence free, ∂x η x + ∂y η y = 0.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 (10) The overall factor q −1 is there to remove the extra degree of freedom in μ to change all μs simultaneously by a constant according to eqn (10.32), which makes the sum over μ in eqn (10.33) redundant by the factor q. (11) This also means that λ(1) = eK − e−K is equal to e−K*+a. (12) Here, K is identified with the temperature, not the inverse temperature, since it appears in the denominator of eqn (10.44). (13) A general quantum duality corresponds to H[J, h] = UH* [h, J]U † where H* is the dual Hamiltonian. (14) If there is more than one singularity and the model is self‐dual, the phase transition point does not necessarily coincide with the self‐dual point. This is the case in the p‐clock model when p # 5, and the self‐dual point is in‐between the two transitions. See Exercise 7.4 in which the existence of an intermediate phase, and thus of two phase transitions, is shown. (15) Compare to eqn (10.2) and note the lack of the factor 2. This is because of the use of different boundary conditions. Page 1 of 12 Numerical methods PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 11.1 Master equation Monte Carlo simulations are realized as the numerical implementation of stochastic dynamics, which is conveniently represented using the master equation. We first introduce the master equation and analyze the properties of its solutions in order to establish a theoretical basis for Monte Carlo simulations that reproduce equilibrium expectation values of physical quantities by stochastic dynamics. We often use notations for the Ising model in the present chapter but in principle the discussions here apply to arbitrary systems with discrete degrees of freedom. The Ising model is a classical spin system for which there is no intrinsic dynamics, such as a Newton or Schrodinger equation of motion, which determine the time evolution of microscopic degrees of freedom. We, nevertheless, think it natural that each spin flips from time to time under the influence of thermal agitation from the environment. The master equation is a useful way to formulate this idea in terms of stochastic changes of spin configurations. This stochastic dynamics, built on concepts of probability theory, represents a fictitious dynamics that, as we will see, allow us to study the thermodynamic properties of the model. Let us denote a spin configuration by an alphabet, e.g. a={1,–1,–1,…,1}. We describe the state of a system using the probability that the system has a configuration a at time t, P(a,t). The Ising model with N spins has the total number of configurations 2N and hence we have a complete stochastic description of the system at time t if we know the 2N values of P(a, t) for all possible as. The master equation describes how this set of probabilities evolves with time. Suppose that the configuration changes from a to b with the transition probability w(a → b)Δ;t (≥ 0) in a small time interval Δt.1 Then, the probability that the system has the configuration a decreases by w(a → b)Δt · P(a, t) because the (p. 259 ) system was in a with probability P(a, t) and then has changed to b with probability w(a → b)Δt. Similarly the probability that the system is in configuration a would increase by the amount w(b → a)Δt ∙ P(b,t) if there is an influx of the configuration from b(= a). Thus, the net change of the probability should be the balance of these two contributions, Page 3 of 12 Numerical methods PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 This is the master equation. Implicit in the above discussion is the concept of a Markov process, where the state of the system at the next time step t + Δt is determined only by the present state at time t and is unaffected by the previous states at t − Δt, t − 2Δt, …. This is a reasonable assumption, although it is usually hard to deduce rigorously from more fundamental rules, and we follow the convention to adopt this assumption here. Also, it is sometimes useful to take the continuous-time limit Δt → 0 and write the master equation as a differential equation. In the present section we use the discrete representation with an application to Monte Carlo simulations in mind. It is convenient to rewrite the master equation in a compact form as Page 4 of 12 Numerical methods PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Discussions in this section are very general and apply to any choices of the transition probability and matrix ℒ as long as the latter is irreducible and positive semi‐definite. Accordingly, the equilibrium distribution e 0 may not necessarily be the Gibbs‐Boltzmann distribution e−βH /Z. We study in the next section the conditions that the transition probability must satisfy for the Gibbs‐Boltzmann distribution to be realized as the equilibrium distribution. (p. 261 ) 11.2 Monte Carlo simulation It is necessary to choose appropriate transition probabilities in Monte Carlo simulations so that the equilibrium distribution is of the Gibbs‐Boltzmann form P(a,t) = e‐βH(a) /Z ≡ P eq(a). Suppose that an equilibrium has been achieved in the master equation (11.1) with P(a,t) = P eq(a).

We next have to determine what types of transitions are allowed, that is, what combinations of a and b would have w(a → b) # 0. The process of a single‐spin flip is often used in Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model, in which only a single spin is flipped in a given time step. We choose site i and decide whether to flip S i to ‐S i according to the probability w(a → b), where Page 7 of 12 Numerical methods PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Calculate the physical quantities of interest for the present configuration {S i}. 6. Repeat 2 to 5 until sufficient statistics has been collected. (p. 264 ) Sample codes are listed in Appendix A.20. There are a number of points to be noticed in the actual implementation of the algorithm. For example, the effects of the initial condition should be discarded because it takes some time, τ = 1/ǀ log λ 1 ǀ, for the system to equilibrate, as discussed in the previous section. Measurements of physical quantities are also to be performed at some intervals of Monte Carlo steps, not at each single step, since consecutive spin configurations are correlated, which prevents us from collecting data drawn independently from the equilibrium distribution. If these conditions are satisfied, spin configurations thus generated are considered to be drawn independently from the Gibbs‐Boltzmann distribution, and hence the simple averages of physical quantities as in eqn (11.22) are usually reliable approximations of the canonical average. Also, as is always the case in data analysis, statistical and systematic errors must be properly estimated, the former as in eqn (11.25) and a typical example of the latter being the finite‐size effects. The method of finite‐size scaling is useful for this purpose. 11.3 Numerical transfer matrix method The numerical transfer matrix method is another popular technique to numerically evaluate physical quantities especially in two dimensions. According to the transfer matrix method described in Chapter 9, we introduce a 2 × 2 transfer matrix for the one‐dimensional Ising model and diagonalize it to obtain the partition function in the thermodynamic limit using the largest eigenvalue. The two‐dimensional case is similar in spirit but is much more complicated in practice because a large 2L × 2L matrix, where L is the linear length of a finite‐size square lattice, should be diagonalized. The numerical transfer matrix method is used instead to evaluate the partition function of a long strip of size M × 2L, where M can, in principle, be chosen as large as we wish. Suppose that we have successfully evaluated the partition function numerically up to the ιth row indicated by circles in Fig. 11.1, starting from Page 10 of 12 Numerical methods PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 Although the simple two‐dimensional Ising model has an exact solution and thus does not need to be analyzed by numerical methods, the method of numerical transfer matrix is useful for more general cases, such as random systems and non‐Ising models. Notes: (1) The transition probability w(a → b) is a conditional probability. (2) The diagonal element ℒaa in eqn (11.3) should be positive semi‐ definite because it is the probability that the system stays in the present configuration a. (3) This theorem states that an irreducible square matrix with positive semi‐ definite elements has its largest (in magnitude) eigenvalue positive and the corresponding eigenvector is non‐degenerate with all its components being positive. (4) Ergodicity is the requirement that our Markov process can reach any configuration of our system from an arbitrary configuration, if we run it long enough.

Then, the integral (A.1) is evaluated asymptotically in the limit N → ∞ as (A.2) which simply amounts to keeping the maximum value of the integrand. This is the result of applying the saddle‐point method or the method of steepest descents. The expansion of f (x) around x 0 starts from the quadratic term since its first‐order term vanishes at the maximum x 0, (A.3) Cubic and higher‐order terms become non‐negligible for larger ǀx − x 0ǀ, where f(x) is significantly smaller than f (x 0). In the integrand of eqn (A.1), f (x) is multiplied by N and is exponentiated, which leads to overwhelmingly smaller values of eNf(x) for x ≠ x 0 compared to Page 2 of 76 Appendix A PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Singularities are expected to come from the long‐ wavelength (small‐q) modes, and therefore the cutoff is supposed not to affect the results, which is indeed the case, as is shown in Section 4.2.2. The momentum cutoff Λ is proportional to the inverse of the shortest length scale, the lattice constant a, which will be gradually increased (i.e. coarse grained) as the renormalization group proceeds. This means that Λ will be gradually decreased by successive elimination of the large‐q (short‐length) degrees of freedom.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 A.7.2 Lie algebra An interesting case, because of the physical consequences, is realized by the presence of continuous symmetries, such as SO(3). We have already seen that the set of continuous transformations forms a group, known as the Lie group. Lie groups play a fundamental role in physics. In the Lie group, a notion of continuity or closeness should be defined such that a finite transformation of the group can be generated by a series of infinitesimal ones. A simple example is the group of spatial translations, for which a finite amount of translation is achieved by the accumulation of infinitesimal translations. For a one‐parameter continuous group, a representation of its elements can be written as Page 34 of 76 Appendix A PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

As anticipated, the relation ~ defines an equivalence relation with the class of loops homotopic to a representative loop Γ denoted as [Γ]. The product or composition of homotopy classes is defined by [Γ1] ◦ [Γ2] = [Γ1 ◦ Γ2]. The first homotopy group or the fundamental group, π 1(#, x 0), is the set of homotopy classes of loops based at x 0 ∈ #. If the topological space # is arcwise connected,11 then two groups based at different points x 0 and x 1 are isomorphic, π 1(#,x 0) ≅ π 1(#,x 1), which means that we can simply write π 1(#) for the fundamental group. In our example of the XY model, the fundamental group is π 1(#1) = ℤ, the group of integers under addition. The first homotopy group classifies classes of loops in a given topological space #. One may sometimes wish to assign other groups to #. Indeed, it is possible to define homotopy classes of n–dimensional (n≥ 1) spheres #n in # with the property that they realize higher homotopy groups, π n(#). As before, if # is arcwise connected, one does not need to specify the base point. The n‐loop based at x 0 ∈ # is a continuous map (p. 294 ) Page 36 of 76 Appendix A PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com). (c) Copyright Oxford University Press, 2012.

Consequently, f is at most linear in coordinates, and ϵ μ is therefore at most quadratic according to eqn (A.151). As discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3, infinitesimal transformations of at most quadratic order correspond to translation, rotation, dilatation and the special conformal transformation. This is what we planned to show. In two dimensions, d = 2, we have the additional result that eqn (A.152) yields the Cauchy–Riemann equations.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 from site to site but this spatially random pattern does not change with time, and is frozen in this sense. The randomly frozen spin state changes if the configuration of interactions {J ij} changes because the environment of each spin changes drastically. This suggests the interpretation that the average of #S i⟩ over the distribution of {J ij} is equivalent to the average over the possibilities of #S i⟩ # 0 and #S i⟩ # 0, and we may well have m = [#S i⟩] = 0. On the other hand, q is the configurational average of a positive quantity and does not vanish, implying the possibility of a phase characterized by m = 0, q # 0. This is the spin glass phase and q is the spin glass order parameter.

Subscriber: UC - Berkeley Library; date: 25 December 2012 It should be noted here that G(0) diverges because of the contribution coming from ǀkǀ → 0 (the short‐wavelength or large‐system‐size limit) according to eqn (A.264). Then, the term j = ι diverges in eqn (A.265) and consequently we have a senseless (p. 313 ) result Z → 0. The neutrality condition Σ j n j = 0 helps us avoid this difficulty because this condition allows us to add (Σ j n j) G(0)(= 0) to the exponent,17 Page 61 of 76 Appendix A PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).

Comparison of this result with eqn (B.12) for the low‐temperature side of the transition point reveals 1/2 for the ratio of critical amplitudes, a universal value independent of the details of the system. The Landau theory also gives 1/2 from eqns (2.22) and (2.23) for the susceptibility above and below the transition point. 2.6 As is well known in the van der Waals theory, the critical point (T → T c) is defined from the equation of state as the inflexion point of the function P(v) = T/(v − b) − a/v 2 Page 6 of 40 Appendix B PRINTED FROM OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP ONLINE (www.oxfordscholarship.com).
