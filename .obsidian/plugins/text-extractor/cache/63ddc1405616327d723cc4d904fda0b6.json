Apply the Markov inequality to the random variable Z* to find the tightest possible (given the available information) upper bound on P(Z>2). Solution: We have E[ZY] 4 1 P(Z>2)=P(Z'>16)< —— = — = —. zz2) (Z'210) < 16 16 4 YYou have used 3 of 3 attempts Show answe","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
