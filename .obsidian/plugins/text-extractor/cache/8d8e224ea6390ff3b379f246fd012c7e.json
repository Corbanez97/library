Solution: a) The conditional distribution of X — 4 given X > 4 is the same geometric PMF that describes the distribution of X. Hence Var (X —4 | X > 4) = Var(X) = 5. b) In the conditional model (i.e., given that X > 4), the random variables X — 4 and X — 8 differ by a constant. Hence they have the same variance and the answer is again 5.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
