Filippenko9 ABSTRACT The Carnegie Supernova Project is a ﬁve-year survey being carried out at the Las Cam- panas Observatory to obtain high-quality light curves of ∼100 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae in a well-deﬁned photometric system. Here we present the ﬁrst release of photometric data that contains the optical light curves of 35 Type Ia supernovae, and near-infrared light curves for a subset of 25 events. The data comprise 5559 optical (ugriBV ) and 1043 near-infrared (Y JHKs) data points in the natural system of the Swope telescope. Twenty-eight supernovae have pre-maximum data, and for 15 of these, the observations begin at least 5 days before B maximum. This is one of the most ac- curate datasets of low-redshift Type Ia supernovae published to date. When completed, the CSP dataset will constitute a fundamental reference for precise determinations of cosmological parameters, and serve as a rich resource for comparison with models of Type Ia supernovae. Subject headings: galaxies: distances and redshifts – supernovae: general – 2 – 1. INTRODUCTION The observation that the expansion rate of the Universe is currently accelerating is arguably one of the most profound discoveries in modern astrophysics. The ﬁrst direct evidence of this phenomenon was provided a decade ago by the Hubble diagram of high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). Since then, a wealth of data obtained from surveys of nearby and distant SNe Ia has conﬁrmed this conclusion, as have other methods such as the X-ray cluster distances (e.g., Allen et al. 2007) and the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect using cosmic microwave background radiation observations (e.g., Giannantonio et al. 2008). These ﬁndings suggest that a new form of energy permeates the Universe, or that the theory of General Relativity breaks down on cosmological scales. Today, the major challenge is to determine the nature of this mysterious energy (commonly referred to as “dark energy”) by measuring its equation-of-state parameter, w = P/(ρc2), and the corresponding time derivative ˙w. SNe Ia are playing an essential role in the endeavor to measure w. Both the SN Legacy Survey (Astier et al. 2006) and the ESSENCE project (Wood-Vasey et al. 2007) have recently provided independent constraints on w that favor a cosmological constant (w = −1). The determination of ˙w, however, will require new and extensive samples of both low- and high-redshift SNe Ia with systematic errors below 1–2%. This will require the construction of a database of low-redshift light curves with excellent photometric precision and temporal coverage The pioneering work of producing such a low-redshift sample of SNe Ia was carried out by the Cal´an/Tololo Survey, which published BV RI light curves of 29 events (Hamuy et al. 1996). This is the local sample that was used by Riess et al. (1998) and Perlmutter et al. (1999) to detect the accelerating expansion of the Universe. In 1999, the CfA Supernova Group released a set of 22 BV RI light curves (Riess et al. 1999). Subsequently, this group has published U BV RI light curves of 44 events (Jha et al. 2006), and U BV RIr′i′ light curves of another 185 (Hicken et al. 2009). Other signiﬁcant samples of nearby SNe Ia are being produced by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS; Filippenko et al. 2001; Filippenko 2005; Filippenko, Li, & Treﬀers 2009) and the Nearby Supernova Factory (Aldering et al. 2002). In addition, the SDSS-II Supernova Survey (Frieman et al. 2008) has obtained u′g′r′i′z′ light curves of a sample of ∼500 spectroscopically conﬁrmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of 0.05 < z < 0.35. In September 2004, the Carnegie Supernova Project (hereafter CSP) began a ﬁve-year pro- gram to obtain densely sampled optical and near-infrared light curves of ∼100 nearby SNe Ia. The overriding goal has been to obtain the highest possible precision in a stable, well-understood photometric system. An additional objective is to use the broad wavelength leverage aﬀorded by these observations to set stringent constraints on the properties of host-galaxy extinction (see Folatelli et al. 2009). In this paper, we present ﬁnal photometry of the ﬁrst 35 SNe Ia observed in the years 2004–2006. This dataset consists of optical (u′g′r′i′BV ) light curves of all 35 SNe, and near-infrared (Y JHKs) light curves for a subset of 25. In total, 5559 optical and 1043 near-infrared measurements were obtained at a typical precision of 0.01–0.03 mag, making this one of the most – 3 – homogeneous and accurate sets of nearby SN Ia light curves yet obtained. A distinguishing aspect of the CSP is the quantity and quality of the near-infrared photometry, which is matched only by the recently published PAIRITEL results (Wood-Vasey et al. 2008). Previously, Hamuy et al. (2006, hereafter H06) gave a detailed description of the CSP ob- serving methodology and data reduction procedures, and showed several examples of light curves obtained during the ﬁrst campaign. In a second paper, Folatelli et al. (2006) reported on the unique Type Ib SN 2005bf, while the third CSP paper presented a detailed analysis of the pecu- liar Type Ia SN 2005hk (Phillips et al. 2007). A fourth paper on the distance to the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/39) based on the Type Ia SN 2007sr was presented by Schweizer et al. (2008). CSP photometry has also been included in case studies of the subluminous Type Ia SN 2005bl (Taubenberger et al. 2008) and the Type Ia/IIn SN 2005gj (Prieto et al. 2007). Most recently, Stritzinger et al. (2009) published a comprehensive study on the Type Ib SN 2007Y. The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the observing and basic data reduction procedures, Section 3 reviews the establishment of the local photometric sequences, Section 4 gives details of the measurement and calibration of the SN photometry, and Section 5 presents the ﬁnal light curves. In two Appendices, we present our most up-to-date information on the sensitivity functions of our u′g′r′i′BV bandpasses, and near-infrared photometry of Feige 16 obtained over the course of our observing campaigns which we use to check the validity of our Y -band calibration. Accompanying this paper are two other papers. The ﬁrst gives an analysis of the data presented here (Folatelli et al. 2009). The second combines the data of this article with that of 35 high-redshift SNe Ia, observed in the near-infrared with the Magellan Baade 6.5-m telescope, in order to construct the ﬁrst rest-frame i-band Hubble diagram out to z ≈ 0.7 (Freedman et al. 2009). 2. OBSERVATIONS AND BASIC DATA REDUCTIONS The CSP carries out one nine-month campaign each year from September through May. All the data presented below were obtained during the ﬁrst three campaigns from 2004 through 2006. In H06, the observing procedures and data reduction techniques were described in detail; below we brieﬂy summarize. Since the publication of H06, the optical photometry reductions have been modiﬁed so that the magnitudes of each SN Ia are computed in the natural system of the Swope telescope CCD imager. This new approach is discussed in Section 4.2.1. 2.1. Sample Selection A list of the general properties of the 35 SNe Ia (17, 14, and 4 in the ﬁrst, second, and third campaigns, respectively) whose light curves are presented in this paper is given in Table 1. This – 4 – table includes (1) the equatorial coordinates of each supernova, (2) the name, morphology, and heliocentric redshift of the host galaxy, (3) the discovery reference, and (4) the discovery group or individual. As is seen, approximately one third of the SNe were discovered by LOSS with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), while the remainder are drawn from a number of sources. In general, the only criteria used by the CSP to select which SN to follow were (1) discovery before or near maximum brightness, and (2) a magnitude no fainter than 18–18.5 at the time of discovery. However, each of the discovery groups or individuals listed in Table 1 employs diﬀerent search strategies (cadence, depth, target selection, etc.). In a future paper, we plan to explore the possible biases introduced by such a heterogeneous sample. Here, we brieﬂy describe the completeness of the LOSS discoveries and how this relates to Malmquist bias. LOSS is a targeted search which annually monitors a sample of ∼ 14, 000 galaxies (Filippenko, Li, & Treﬀers 2009, and references therein). In 2004, the search was deliberately adjusted to include more galaxies south of the celestial equator, to enlarge the potential sample accessible to the CSP. In order to study the completeness of the survey, we constructed an observed luminosity function for LOSS SNe Ia from 56 discoveries within 80 Mpc. Based on this luminosity function, we conclude that LOSS has missed very few SNe Ia in its sample galaxies within z ≤ 0.04. Over most of the observed luminosity range, the expected completeness is > 80% at z = 0.04. Since most of the LOSS galaxies are within 100 Mpc (z = 0.024), the actual missing fraction of SNe Ia is quite small. Hence, a program that follows all of the LOSS SN Ia discoveries should end up with a fairly complete sample, with minimal Malmquist bias. Of course, the CSP is only able to follow those LOSS SNe which are accessible from the southern hemisphere. For these galaxies, which are located at relatively large zenith distances at Lick Observatory, the completeness is probably somewhat smaller due to the diﬃculty of the observations (seeing conditions, airmass, etc.). Nevertheless, we expect that Malmquist bias for the subset of the LOSS SNe Ia at z ≤ 0.04 followed by the CSP should be small. Of the 12 LOSS SNe included in Table 1, only one (SN 2005ag) lies at z > 0.04. 2.2. Observations Our follow-up program focuses on supernovae discovered by professional and amateur as- tronomers who report them to the IAU Circulars (IAUC), the IAU Electronic Telegrams (CBET), or occasionally, directly to us via electronic mail. When word arrives of a new candidate, we place it in our follow-up queue. Photometric monitoring is obtained entirely at the Las Campanas Ob- servatory (LCO). The optical follow-up observations are conducted with the SITe3 CCD camera attached to the Swope 1-m telescope, which has been available to the CSP ∼250 nights per cam- paign. During the ﬁrst campaign, the near-infrared follow-up was carried out solely with the Wide Field Infrared Camera (WIRC) attached to the du Pont 2.5-m telescope. However, by the start of the second campaign, a new near-infrared camera called RetroCam, built by S.E.P. and D.M. for this program, became available on the Swope telescope. The addition of RetroCam signiﬁcantly enhanced our ability to obtain detailed Y JH-band light curves. Nevertheless, we have continued – 5 – to use WIRC to observe the fainter targets. In several cases, supplementary imaging has also been performed with the near-infrared imager, PANIC, attached to the Magellan Baade telescope. In addition to follow-up observations, the du Pont telescope is used to obtain optical and near-infrared template images of the host galaxies. These templates are used to subtract away the host-galaxy contamination in each of our science images before instrumental magnitudes are computed (see § 4.1). Figure 1 presents a mosaic constructed with a V -band image of each supernova. In Table 2, the following photometric and spectroscopic information is collected for each supernova: (1) an estimate of the decline-rate parameter ∆m15(B) (Phillips 1993), (2) the number of optical and near-infrared epochs each event was observed, (3) the number of photometric nights that the optical and near-infrared local sequences were calibrated, and (4) the spectral subtype of each event and the epoch of the spectrum used to make the identiﬁcation. Spectral identiﬁcation was performed using the SuperNova IDentiﬁcation tool SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007). Twenty-six events are identiﬁed as normal, four as SN 1991bg-like, two as SN 1991T-like, and one as SN 2006gz-like. The identiﬁcation of a dozen of the normal subtypes was obtained with spectra suﬃciently past maximum that a SN 1991T-like identiﬁcation cannot be excluded. However, out of these dozen events, only SN 2005lu (∆m15(B) = 0.88 ± 0.03) has a B-band decline rate that is similar to that of other SN 1991T-like events, which typically exhibit ∆m15(B) values of 0.9 or less. Figure 3 compares our day −3 spectrum of SN 2004gu to similar-epoch spectra of the peculiar SNe 1999ac (Phillips et al. 2006) and 2006gz (Hicken et al. 2007; Maeda et al. 2009). As is evident, SN 2004gu resembled both of these events, but clearly a better overall match is with SN 2006gz. The spectra of SNe 2004gu and 2006gz show an unusually strong Si III line at 4560 ˚A while the Ca II H&K feature appears to be more prevalent in SN 2004gu. Interestingly, SNe 2004gu and 2006gz have nearly identical decline rates of ∆m15(B) ≈ 0.70–0.80 mag. Moreover, for a reddening law of RV = 1.2, we compute very similar absolute peak magnitudes of MB = −19.63 ± 0.09 for SN 2004gu (Folatelli et al. 2009) and MB = −19.57 ± 0.16 for SN 2006gz (Hicken et al. 2007). 2.3. Data Reduction Basic data reductions are generally carried out the day following the observation. This allows us to measure preliminary photometry to obtain a prompt estimate of the age and brightness of the SN. This information is particularly useful to help us decide whether or not a new target merits extensive follow-up observations. The optical images are reduced with the IRAF9 task CCDPROC. The basic reduction process – 6 – consists of (1) bias subtraction, (2) ﬂat-ﬁelding, (3) application of a linearity correction appropriate for the SITe3 CCD, and (4) an exposure-time correction that corrects for a shutter time delay. Both the linearity and exposure-time corrections were monitored frequently during the ﬁrst three campaigns, and the results are completely consistent with those given in Appendices A and B of H06. For basic reduction of the near-infrared imaging, we have developed a speciﬁc data reduction pipeline (written in C that uses IRAF libraries) for each instrument at LCO. These pipelines apply to each image corrections for detector linearity, electronic bias, pixel-to-pixel variations of the detector’s sensitivity, and sky background. During the September–May period, the atmospheric conditions at LCO are typically quite stable. Through the course of the CSP, we found that signiﬁcant variations in seeing did not normally occur between the individual dithered images. Hence, as a general rule, once all of the dithered images were fully reduced, they were aligned and stacked without convolving the image quality to make a master frame which was then used to compute photometry. 3. PHOTOMETRIC SEQUENCES The brightness of each supernova is obtained diﬀerentially with respect to a set of local sequence stars. Absolute photometry of each local sequence is derived using observations of photometric standards generally obtained on a minimum of three photometric nights (see columns 5 and 6 of Table 2). In the optical, we use standards that are in common with both the Landolt (1992) and Smith et al. (2002) catalogs. Aperture photometry of the standard stars is computed using an aperture with a radius of 7′′. To place the instrumental magnitudes of the local sequence stars on the standard Landolt BV and Smith et al. (USNO40) u′g′r′i′ photometric systems, we use the transformation equations 1–6 given in H06. Figures 4 and 5 show plots of the extinction and color coeﬃcients employed in these transformation equations, which were derived on photometric nights during the ﬁrst four CSP campaigns. These ﬁgures illustrate the stability of our photometric system, as well as the excellent quality of the LCO site where, during September–May, conditions are photometric ∼ 65% of the time. When determining absolute photometry of the local sequences, we have used the average values of the color coeﬃcients obtained during the ﬁrst campaign (see Figure 4 of H06). These values diﬀer only slightly from the four-year averages shown in Figure 5. The ﬁnal magnitudes reported for each sequence star were determined from an average of measurements that were calibrated to standard ﬁelds typically on a minimum of three photometric nights. The color terms shown in Figure 5 can be used to improve our knowledge of the response functions of the CSP optical ﬁlters. In Appendix A, we describe such an analysis. In summary, we – 7 – ﬁnd that matching the color terms for the BV and g′r′i′ ﬁlters requires only minor modiﬁcations of the bandpasses given in H06. However, the response function of the CSP u′ ﬁlter clearly diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that provided in H06. Absolute photometry of the near-infrared local sequences was calibrated with observations of Persson et al. (1998) standards. Standard Y -band magnitudes of the Persson et al. standards were derived from J- and Ks-band measurements as described by equation C2 of H06. As detailed in Appendix B, observations of the A0V star Feige 16 obtained during the course of the CSP campaigns conﬁrm that the Y -band calibration given in H06 is consistent with the Elias et al. (1982) system, where α Lyrae has 0.00 color. As in H06, we neglect any color term in the near- infrared (see equations 8–11 in H06) since we have been using essentially the same ﬁlters employed by Persson et al. to establish the standard system. This assumption will be examined and tested in a future paper. Final magnitudes of the local sequences in the standard system are listed in Table 3. The ac- companying uncertainties are weighted averages of the instrumental errors computed from multiple measurements of each sequence star obtained on diﬀerent photometric nights. As many of our near-infrared local standards are also included in the 2MASS catalog10, we have carried out a comparison of photometry. A total of 984 stars were identiﬁed with J- and H- band measurements in both systems, whereas for Ks we found only 41 stars in common. Generally speaking, the uncertainties in the 2MASS measurements are a factor of ∼2 larger than those in the CSP photometry. Concentrating on the J and H bands, we ﬁnd the following mean oﬀsets between the zero points of the CSP and 2MASS magnitudes: JCSP − J2MASS = 0.010 ± 0.003 mag, HCSP − H2MASS = 0.043 ± 0.003 mag. To determine if there are any signiﬁcant color terms, we looked for possible correlations of JCSP − J2MASS and HCSP − H2MASS vs. (J − H)CSP. Over the range of color covered by the stars [0.2 < (J − H)CSP < 0.7 mag], we obtained the following ﬁts: JCSP − J2MASS = (−0.045 ± 0.008) × (J − H)CSP + (0.035 ± 0.067) HCSP − H2MASS = (0.005 ± 0.006) × (J − H)CSP + (0.038 ± 0.080). Thus, there is some indication of a small color term in the J band, but not in H. – 8 – 4. SUPERNOVA PHOTOMETRY 4.1. Host-Galaxy Subtraction Before ﬁnal photometry of each SN is computed, a template image of the host galaxy is subtracted from each science frame. The templates are obtained a year or more after the last follow-up image with the du Pont telescope using the same ﬁlters employed to take the original science images. By this time the brightness of the SN has decreased by at least ∼5 mag below the last follow-up measurement. Useful templates are ∼3 mag deeper than the Swope images, and are always obtained under seeing conditions that either exceed or match those of the best science frames. Although the template and science images are obtained with the same ﬁlters, a legitimate concern is whether there is a diﬀerence between the global response function of the Swope and du Pont instrument/telescope systems, which could aﬀect the quality of our subtractions. To ascertain if such a problem exists, we compared photometry of the local sequence stars derived from both Swope and du Pont images that were observed during photometric nights. This exercise revealed no indication of any relative color terms. However, in the future, when a more statistically signiﬁcant sample of template images becomes available, we will revisit this issue. To perform the galaxy subtraction, the template images are geometrically transformed to each science image, convolved with a two-dimensional kernel function to match the point-spread functions (PSFs), and then scaled in ﬂux. The modiﬁed template is then subtracted from the follow- up images around the position of the SN with care taken not to subtract away any local sequence stars. Figure 2 displays two cases of galaxy subtractions where the SN is located in a region with substantial host-galaxy contamination. These examples demonstrate the excellent subtractions that we are able to obtain despite the presence of a signiﬁcant background. Experiments done by adding a sequence of artiﬁcial stars to the template-subtracted images surrounding the location of the SN indicate that in essentially all cases the maximum systematic errors incurred from the template subtractions average < 0.01 mag. Nevertheless, despite the excellent quality of the template subtractions, it is still possible for the template-subtraction process to introduce a systematic error at the speciﬁc location of the SN. Such an error could, in principle, lead to a correlated error in the light-curve photometry since the same template is employed in the host-galaxy subtractions for all of the SN images. We note that even in the ideal case of a perfect subtraction, there will be a correlated error caused by the ﬁnite signal-to-noise ratio in the template image. We have estimated the magnitude of such correlations using the photometry of artiﬁcial stars located at ﬁxed positions around the SN, for those cases with the highest background. As explained by Folatelli et al. (2009), we found negligible variations in the light-curve ﬁt parameters and their uncertainties when considering these correlations. – 9 – 4.2. Photometry 4.2.1. Optical At this point our procedure supersedes what was described in H06. Given the non-stellar nature of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of SNe Ia, the conversion of instrumental magnitudes to the standard system by application of the color term derived from the photometric standard stars does not guarantee that the SN photometry will actually be on the standard system. On the contrary, signiﬁcant systematic errors can occur between two sets of observations of the same SN put on the same photometric system through application of color terms if the ﬁlter response functions are very diﬀerent (e.g., see Figure 2 in Krisciunas et al. 2003). It is possible to place the SN photometry in the standard (or any other desired) photometric system only via application of an additional time-dependent term computed synthetically from template SN spectra, often referred to as an “S-correction” (Suntzeﬀ 2000; Stritzinger et al. 2002). We emphasize that this physical eﬀect is important to consider when CSP photometry is to be combined with other optical datasets, regardless of whether the photometry has been color-corrected. A sensible alternative which has been adopted by several other groups (e.g., SN Legacy Survey, ESSENCE, and the CfA Supernova Group) is to not apply the color-term and S-corrections, and explicitly calculate the SN magnitudes in the natural photometric system used for the observa- tions. We thus provide our measurements in the ugriBV 11 natural system of the Swope telescope. Photometry in the natural system is the “purest” form of the data and will facilitate in a more transparent way the combination of the CSP photometry with datasets from other groups. More- over, photometry in this format allows one to easily incorporate improved SN spectral template sequences and/or passbands. The speciﬁc procedure we have adopted to compute photometry in the natural system is as follows. (1) The magnitudes of the photometric standards given in the catalogs of Landolt (1992) and Smith et al. (2002) are used to calculate new magnitudes of these stars in the natural photometric system of the Swope telescope using the following formulae: u = u ′ std − ctu × (u ′ std − g′ std), (1) g = g′ std − ctg × (g′ std − r′ std), (2) r = r′ std − ctr × (r′ std − i ′ std), (3) i = i ′ std − cti × (r′ std − i ′ std), (4) B = Bstd − ctb × (Bstd − Vstd), and (5) – 10 – V = Vstd − ctv × (Vstd − i ′ std), (6) where ctx are the color terms deﬁned in equations 1-6 of H06 (and listed in Figure 4 of H06), and the magnitudes with the “std” subscript are the catalog magnitudes. In constructing our catalog of photometric standards, great care was taken to select stars that cover a broad range in color. Consequently, the optical standards observed by the CSP cover a color range of −0.32 < B − V < 1.60 mag. For comparison, the vast majority of local sequence stars fall well within this color range. (2) The new catalog of revised photometry is then used to generate natural magnitudes for the local sequence of each SN ﬁeld from observations obtained on photometric nights. The transformation equation in each band contains an extinction term and a zero point, mnat = minst − ki Xi + zpi . where ki is the extinction coeﬃcient and Xi is the eﬀective airmass. Note that, unlike equations 1-6 of H06, this equation does not include a color term. (3) Instrumental magnitudes of the local sequence stars and the SN are measured on each galaxy- subtracted frame via PSF ﬁtting. Next these measurements of the local sequence are compared to the calibrated values in the natural system in order to derive a nightly zero point. This zero point is then used to place the extinction-corrected (kiX) instrumental magnitude of the SN in the natural system. The treatment of uncertainties is improved with respect to the procedures described in H06. The adopted uncertainty in each magnitude measurement is the result of the sum in quadrature of two components: (a) the uncertainty in the instrumental magnitude, as estimated from the Poisson noise model of the ﬂux of the SN and the surrounding background, and (b) the uncertainty in the ﬁt of the zero point of the image. By considering the latter term we no longer need to adopt an uncertainty minimum of 0.015 mag, as was done in H06. 4.2.2. Near-Infrared In the near-infrared, we continue to use the procedures described in H06 to measure the ﬁnal SN magnitudes. As mentioned in Section 3, we neglect any color terms in transforming the measurements made at the Swope and du Pont telescopes to the Persson et al. (1998) photometric system. Therefore, the local sequence is used only to compute the nightly zero point. Regarding the magnitude uncertainties, we adopt the same procedure as described in the previous section for the optical data: we sum in quadrature the uncertainties in the instrumental magnitude and in the zero-point ﬁt. – 11 – 5. FINAL LIGHT CURVES The ﬁnal ugriBV and Y JHKs magnitudes of the 35 SNe Ia presented in this paper are listed in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. These data are being made available through the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), and can also be accessed on the CSP web site12. Figure 6 shows the optical and near-infrared light curves, along with ﬁts carried out with SNOOPy (SuperNovae in Object-Oriented Python; Burns et al. 2009). The template-ﬁtting algo- rithm implemented in SNOOPy is very simple. We begin by selecting a sample of well-observed CSP supernovae that have clear maxima. Using spline ﬁts, we measure the time of B maximum tmax, peak magnitude mmax in each ﬁlter, and decline-rate parameter ∆m15(B). Each light curve is nor- malized to its peak magnitude and shifted in time such that the B band peaks at epoch t = 0. Once this procedure has been done, each data point can be placed in a three-dimensional space based on its epoch, normalized magnitude, and ∆m15(B). The normalized magnitudes then deﬁne a sparsely sampled surface in this space. Generating a template for a particular ∆m15(B) and set of epochs therefore amounts to interpolating on this surface. For this task, we have chosen a variation of the “gloess” algorithm (Madore 2001), which is a Gaussian-windowed and error-weighted extension of data-smoothing methods outlined by Cleveland (1979), and ﬁrst implemented by Persson et al. (2004) for ﬁtting Cepheid light curves. A subset of points situated around the interpolation point are selected and assigned weights using an adaptive elliptical Gaussian. These points are then ﬁt with a two-dimensional quadratic using weighted linear least squares. The resulting quadratic is then used to interpolate the point of interest. Given the non-linear nature of this interpolation algorithm, we use the Levenberg-Marquardt least squares algorithm to ﬁt the light-curve templates to the data. In doing so, we determine the values of tmax, ∆m15(B), and the peak magnitudes for each ﬁlter, as well as a complete covariance matrix for these parameters. The light-curve ﬁtting is performed in ﬂux space. Appendix C gives details of the zero points adopted for the CSP bandpasses. The ∆m15(B) values derived from the SNOOPy ﬁts are given in Table 2.13 From the values of tmax, we ﬁnd that 28 of the 35 SNe have pre-maximum coverage, and for 15 of these, the observations began at least 5 days before B maximum. In the near-infrared, 17 of the SNe have coverage beginning at or before maximum light, which occurs 3–5 days prior to B-band maximum (Folatelli et al. 2009). This was attained for only 4 of the 17 SNe observed during the ﬁrst campaign, but was achieved for 13 of the 18 SNe observed in the second and third campaigns. This huge improvement is due to the availability of RetroCam beginning in the second campaign. Since its commissioning, RetroCam has become our primary source of near-infrared data, and has allowed the CSP to fulﬁll its goal of obtaining excellent near-infrared coverage for the majority of the monitored SNe. – 12 – 6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have presented the ﬁrst data release of low-redshift SNe Ia observed by the CSP. The combination of pre-maximum observations, extended coverage, dense sampling, and high signal-to-noise ratio data produces a dataset of unprecedented quality. These results will make possible detailed studies of the photometric properties of SNe Ia and serve as a rich resource for comparison with theoretical models. When completed, the CSP dataset will constitute a funda- mental reference for precise determinations of cosmological parameters such as our own program to measure the i′-band Hubble diagram of SNe Ia to z ≈ 0.7 (Freedman et al. 2009). The inclusion of the near-infrared data is an important addition since SNe Ia are nearly perfect standard candles at these wavelengths (Krisciunas et al. 2004). In addition, the broad wavelength range covered by the optical and near-infrared observations provides strong leverage for estimating dust extinction in the SN Ia host galaxies (Folatelli et al. 2009).

A. OPTICAL FILTER BANDPASSES In order to test the CSP optical bandpass response functions given in H06, and to improve these if possible, we employ an approach similar to that of Stritzinger et al. (2005). We start by multiplying the SEDs of the Stritzinger et al. (2005) spectrophotometric atlas of 102 stars with – 13 – the Johnson B and V passbands from Bessell (1990) and the u′g′r′i′ passbands from Smith et al. (2002) to calculate synthetic magnitudes. We derive color terms and zero points by ﬁtting the transformation equations Bobs − Bsyn = ctB × (Bsyn − Vsyn) + zpB, Vobs − Vsyn = ctV × (Bsyn − Vsyn) + zpV , u ′ obs − u′ syn = ctu′ × (u′ syn − g′ syn) + zpu′, g′ obs − g′ syn = ctg′ × (g′ syn − r′ syn) + zpg′, r′ obs − r′ syn = ctr′ × (r′ syn − i ′ syn) + zpr′, and i ′ obs − i ′ syn = cti′ × (r′ syn − i ′ syn) + zpi′, where the “obs” subscript denotes the magnitudes from the Landolt (1992) and Smith et al. (2002) catalogs. If the color terms, ctX , diﬀer from zero, the bandpasses are shifted in wavelength without changing their shapes. Magnitudes and color terms are recalculated, and the process is repeated until the color terms are consistent with zero. In B and V , we used the 91 stars contained in both the spectrophotometric atlas and the photometric catalog of Landolt (1992) which are not listed as possible variables. The derived ﬁlter shifts of 12.4 ± 3 ˚A in B and 8.2 ± 4 ˚A in V are similar to the values of 8.5 ˚A in B and 6 ˚A in V found by Stritzinger et al. (2005). The small diﬀerences may be due to the inclusion of stars noted as variable or possibly variable by Stritzinger et al. (2005) which were not included in our analysis. The same analysis was performed for the u′g′r′i′ bandpasses. The Smith et al. (2002) u′ ﬁlter had to be slightly modiﬁed: at wavelengths shorter than 3100 ˚A, the transmission was set to zero because the Stritzinger et al. (2005) spectra begin at 3050 ˚A. This modiﬁcation produces photon losses of < 6%. Unfortunately, only 16 of the 102 stars in the Stritzinger et al. (2005) spectrophotometric atlas are included in the Smith et al. (2002) catalog. From this limited sample, the color terms for the g′ and r′ ﬁlters were found to be consistent with zero without applying any shifts. The color terms of the u′ and i′ ﬁlters diﬀered from zero by ∼ 2σ, but given the small sample size, we did not consider this conclusive. Hence, we opted not to apply any shifts to the Smith et al. (2002) u′g′r′i′ bandpasses. Next, we used these revised standard bandpasses to calculate synthetic magnitudes in the BV and u′g′r′i′ systems for the 91 non-variable stars in the Stritzinger et al. (2005) spectrophotometric atlas. Final adjustment of the zero points for the each bandpass were derived by calculating synthetic magnitudes in BV for α Lyrae and u′g′r′i′ for BD+17◦4708, and matching these to their standard magnitudes as given by Bessell, Castelli, & Plez (1998), Johnson & Morgan (1953), Fukugita et al. (1996), and Smith et al. (2002). Likewise, synthetic magnitudes in the CSP natural system were calculated using the BV and ugri bandpasses given in H06. Values for the color terms and zero points were derived from least-squares ﬁts to the transformation equations – 14 – Bstd − Bnat = ctb × (Bnat − Vnat) + zpb, Vstd − Vnat = ctv × (Vnat − inat) + zpv, u ′ std − unat = ctu × (unat − gnat) + zpu, g′ std − gnat = ctg × (gnat − rnat) + zpg, r′ std − rnat = ctr × (rnat − inat) + zpr, and i ′ std − inat = cti × (rnat − inat) + zpi, where the “std” subscript denotes the synthetic magnitudes in the standard system, and the “nat” subscript signiﬁes synthetic magnitudes calculated in the natural bandpasses. The natu- ral bandpasses were shifted in wavelength, maintaining their shapes, until the calculated color terms matched the observed ones listed in Figure 4 of H06. As illustrated in Figures 7, excellent results were achieved for the BV gri ﬁlters by applying the following small shifts: B = 21.8 ± 9.7 ˚A, V = 28.6 ± 17.5 ˚A, g = −14.2 ± 14.1 ˚A, r = −5.0 ± 17.0 ˚A, and i = −10.1 ± 28.6 ˚A. The quoted errors for these shifts were derived from matching the formal errors of the observed color terms (see Figure 5). In the case of the CSP u ﬁlter, Figure 7 shows that the observed color term is not at all close to that predicted from the bandpass given in H06. Indeed, even after applying quite large shifts we were unable to match the observed color term. Reasonable agreement could only be achieved after applying a cutoﬀ to the bandpass on the blue side beginning at ∼ 3800 ˚A and falling to zero at ∼ 3300 ˚A. This modiﬁed u ﬁlter bandpass, which must be considered very preliminary at this point, is plotted in Figure 8, and the results of the synthetic color-term calculation are shown in Figure 7. We have veriﬁed that the transmission of the CSP u ﬁlter is consistent with the measurements of the manufacturer, and so this blue cutoﬀ in the bandpass must be produced by the Swope CCD imager, or the telescope optics. We are continuing to investigate this discrepancy so as to provide a more reliable response function for the CSP u bandpass. B. Y JH MEASUREMENTS OF FEIGE 16 According to Landolt (1983, 1992), the A0V star Feige 16 (Feige 1958) has U BV RI colors close to zero. It therefore aﬀords us the opportunity to check the Y -band photometric system presented by Hillenbrand et al. (2002) and in Appendix C of H06. Fifteen measurements of Feige 16 were conducted on six nights with RetroCam. The photometry was computed with respect to several (four to six) Persson et al. (1998) solar-analog standards on each night. We discarded one J and four H measurements as they clearly lay well outside the cluster of values that were averaged with equal weight. Table 6 contains the results, together with the values given by Leggett et al. (2006), – 15 – transformed according to their prescription, from their Mauna Kea Observatory (MKO) system to the LCO system. We have added 0.015 mag (1σ of the mean) in quadrature to our uncertainties to account for small unknown systematics. For example, although we are treating our JH data as if they were on the system deﬁned by Persson et al. (1998), the fact is that there could be small diﬀerences due to the diﬀerent cameras being used then and now (the ﬁlter bandpasses are identical). The LCO and (transformed) MKO JH measurements agree well, within the stated combined uncertainties. The important result for the calibration of the Y and J bands is that the colors Y − J = −0.009 mag and Y − H = 0.013 mag are satisfyingly close to zero. This conﬁrms that our Y -band measurements are indeed on the Elias et al. (1982) system where α Lyrae has 0.00 color. It also conﬁrms the Y − J colors for the Persson et al. (1998) standard stars predicted from model atmospheres presented in Appendix C of H06. The V magnitude of Feige 16 is 12.400 (Landolt 1983, 1992). Assuming that all the near- infrared colors are actually zero, the average of all the Y JHKs measurements (on the LCO system) is 12.355 mag, indicating that the star may be slightly reddened. If so, E(B − V ) = 0.015 mag. C. PHOTOMETRIC ZERO POINTS The photometric zero point for a ﬁlter X with a bandpass response function SX can be deﬁned as ZPX = 2.5 log [∫ ∞ 0 SX (λ) F0 (λ) λ – 16 – (2004a) SED for Vega and the i′ ﬁlter function from Fukugita et al. (1996) to compute a synthetic i′ Vega = 0.382 mag. C.2. ugri Photometry The CSP uses the Smith et al. (2002) standard stars for the ugri photometry, which are tied to the SED of BD+17◦4708. In order to maintain consistency with our choice of the Bohlin & Gilliland (2004a) SED for Vega, we use the SED of BD+17◦4708 as given by Bohlin & Gilliland (2004b) 2. For the assumed ugri magnitudes of BD+17◦4708, we use the values listed in Smith et al. (2002) for the USNO 1.0-m photometric telescope. These magnitudes are then converted to the LCO natural system using the color terms from Hamuy et al. (2006). C.3. Near-Infrared Photometry Our Y JHK photometry uses the standards of Persson et al. (1998), which are tied to the Elias et al. (1982) standards. The Elias et al. (1982) standards are, in turn, tied to Vega. We are therefore on a Vega system and use the Bohlin & Gilliland (2004a) SED. We assume JVega = −0.001, HVega = 0.000, and KVega = −0.001 mag (Cohen et al. 1999), as well as YVega = 0.000 mag (Hamuy et al. 2006). REFERENCES Aldering, G., et al. 2002, SPIE, 4836, 61 Allen, S.
