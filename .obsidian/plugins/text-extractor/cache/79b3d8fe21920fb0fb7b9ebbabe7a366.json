Jon Kimerling ABSTRACT: In recent years, a number of data structures for global geo-referenced data sets have been proposed based on regular, multi-resolution partitions of polyhedra. We present a survey of the most promising of such systems, which we call Geodesic Discrete Global Grid Systems (Geodesic DGGSs). We show that Geodesic DGGS alternatives can be constructed by specifying five substantially indepen- dent design choices: a base regular polyhedron, a fixed orientation of the base regular polyhedron relative to the Earth, a hierarchical spatial partitioning method defined symmetrically on a face (or set of faces) of the base regular polyhedron, a method for transforming that planar partition to the corresponding spherical/ellipsoidal surface, and a method for assigning point representations to grid cells. The majority of systems surveyed are based on the icosahedron, use an aperture 4 triangle or hexagon partition, and are either created directly on the surface of the sphere or by using an equal- area transformation. An examination of the design choice options leads us to the construction of the Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area aperture 3 Hexagon (ISEA3H) Geodesic DGGS. KEYWORDS: Discrete global grid systems, spatial data structures, global data models Discrete Global Grid Systems: Basic Definitions Discrete Global Grid A Discrete Global Grid (DGG) consists of a set of regions that form a partition of the Earth’s surface, where each region has a single point contained in the region associated with it. Each region/point combination is a cell. Depending on the application, data objects or vectors of values may be associated with regions, points, or cells. If an application defines only the regions, the centroids of the regions form a suitable set of associated points. Conversely, if an application defines only the points, the Voronoi regions of those points form an obvious set of asso- ciated cell regions. Applications often use DGGs with cell regions that are irregular in shape and/or size. For example, the division of the Earth’s surface into land masses and bodies of water constitutes one of the most important DGGs. A more general example, the Hipparchus System (Lukatella 2002), allows the creation of arbi- Kevin Sahr is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Southern Oregon University, Ashland, OR 97520.

But, for many applications, it is desirable to have cells consisting of highly regular regions with evenly distributed points. Regular DGGs are unbiased with respect to spatial patterns created by natural and human processes and allow for the development of simple and efficient algorithms. A single regular DGG may play multiple data structure roles. It may function as a raster data structure, where each cell region constitutes a pixel. It may serve as a vector data structure, where the set of DGG points replaces traditional coordinate pairs (Dutton 1999). Each data object may be associ- ated with the smallest cell region in which it is fully contained, and these minimum bounding cells may then be used as a coarse filter in operations such as object intersection. The DGG can also be used as a useful graph data structure by taking the DGG points as the graph vertices and then connecting points associated with neighboring cells with unit- weight edges. The most commonly used regular DGGs are those based on the geographic (latitude–longitude) coor- dinate system. Raster global data sets often employ cell regions with edges defined by arcs of equal-angle increments of latitude and longitude (for example, the 2.5 0 x 2.5 0, 5 0 x 5 0, and 10 0 x 10 0 NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) grids described in Brooks (1981)). Data values may also be associ- ated with points spaced at equal-angle intervals of latitude and longitude (for example, the 5’ x 5’ spacing of the ETOPO5 global elevation data set 122 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 123 (Hastings and Dunbar 1998)). Similarly, vector data sets that employ a geographic coordinate system to define location values commonly choose a specific precision for those values. The choice of a specific precision for geographic coordinates forms an implicit grid of fixed points at regular angular increments of latitude and longitude, and a particular data set of that precision can consist only of coordinate values chosen from this set of fixed points. Ideally, the regions associated with the geographic vector coordinate points would be the corresponding Voronoi regions on the Earth’s surface, although they are more commonly the corresponding Voronoi regions on a surrogate representation of the Earth’s surface, such as a sphere or ellipsoid. In practice, applications often implicitly employ Voronoi regions defined on the longitude x latitude plane, on which the regions are, conveniently, regular planar squares. As we shall see, employing a surrogate representation for the Earth’s surface on which the cell regions are regular planar polygons is a useful and common approach in DGG construction. Discrete Global Grid System A Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) is a series of discrete global grids. Usually, this series consists of increasingly finer resolution grids; i.e., the grids in the series have a monotonically increasing number of cells. If the grids are defined consistently using regular planar polygons on a surrogate surface, we can define the aperture of a DGGS as the ratio of the areas of a planar polygon cell at resolution k and at resolution k+1 (this is a generalization of the definition given in Bell et al.(1983)). Later we will discuss DGGSs that have more than one type of polygonal cell region. In these cases there is always one cell type that clearly predominates, and the aperture of the system is defined using the dominant cell type. Kimerling et al. (1999) and Clarke (2002) note the importance of regular hierarchical relationships between DGGS resolutions in creating efficient data structures. Two types of hierarchical relationship are common. A DGGS is congruent if and only if each resolution k cell region consists of a union of resolution k+1 cell regions. A DGGS is aligned if and only if each resolution k cell point is also a cell point in resolution k+1. If a DGGS does not have these properties, the system is defined as incongru- ent or unaligned. For example, the most widely used DGGS is generated implicitly by multiple precisions of decimal geographic vector representations. This DGGS has an aperture of 10 and is incongruent and aligned (Figure 1). Discrete Global Grid Systems based on the geo- graphic coordinate system have numerous practical advantages. The geographic coordinate system has been used extensively since well before the computer era and is therefore the basis for a wide array of existing data sets, processing algorithms, and soft- ware. Grids based on square partitions are by far the most familiar to users, and they map efficiently to common data structures and display devices. But such grids also have limitations. Discrete Global Grid Systems induced by the latitude–lon- gitude graticule do not have equal-area cell regions, which complicates statistical analysis on these grids. The cells become increasingly distorted in area, shape, and inter-point spacing as one moves north and south from the equator. The north and south poles, both points on the surface of the globe, map to lines on the longitude x latitude plane; the top and bottom row of grid cells are, in fact, triangles, not squares as they appear on the plane. These polar singularities have forced applications such as global climate modeling to make use of special grids for the polar regions. Square grids in general do not exhibit uniform adjacency; that is, each square grid cell has four neighbors with which it shares an edge and whose centers are equidistant from its center. Each cell, however, also has four neighbors with which it shares only a vertex and whose centers are a different distance from its center than the distance to the centers of the edge neighbors. This compli- Figure 1. A portion of two resolutions (10 0 and 1 0 precision) of the DGGS implicitly generated by multiple precisions of decimal geographic coordinate system vector representations. Note that this is an incongruent, aligned hierarchy. 122 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 123 cates the use of these grids for such applications as discrete simulations. Attempts have been made to create DGGs based on the geographic coordinate system but adjusted to address some of these difficulties. For example, Kurihara (1965) decreased the number of cells with increasing latitude so as to achieve more consistent cell region sizes. Bailey (1956), Paul (1973), and Brooks (1981) used similar adjustments of latitude and/or longitude cell edges to achieve cell regions with approximately equal areas. But these schemes achieved more regular cell region areas at the cost of more irregular cell region shapes and more complex cell adjacencies. Tobler and Chen (1986) projected the Earth onto a rectangle using a Lambert cylin- drical equal area projection and then recursively subdivided that rectangle, but, as in the case of the other mentioned approaches, this did not address the basic problem that the sphere/ellipsoid and the plane are not topologically equivalent. Geodesic Discrete Global Grid Systems The inadequacies of DGGSs based on the geo- graphic coordinate system have led a number of researchers to explore alternative approaches. Many of these approaches involve the use of regular polyhedra as topologically equivalent sur- rogates for the Earth’s surface, and, in our opinion, these attempts have led to the most promising known options for DGGSs. A number of research- ers have been inspired directly or indirectly by R. Buckminster Fuller’s work in discretizing the sphere, which led to his development of the geo- desic dome (Fuller 1975). We will thus refer to this class of DGGSs as Geodesic Discrete Global Grid Systems. Geodesic DGGSs have been proposed for a number of specific applications. Inherently regular in design, these systems have most commonly been used to store raster data sets, but they may also be used as a substitute for traditional coordinate-based vector data structures (Dutton 1999), as data containers, or as the basis for graphs (as described in the previous section). Geodesic DGGSs have been used to develop statistically sound survey sampling designs on the Earth’s surface (Olsen et al. 1998), for optimum path determination (Stefanakis and Kavouras 1995), for line simplification (Dutton 1999), for indexing geospatial databases (Otoo and Zhu 1993; Dutton 1999; Alborzi and Samet 2000), and for the generation of spherical Voronoi diagrams (Chen et al. 2003). They have also been proposed as the basis for dynamic simulations such as those used in global climate modeling (Williamson 1968; Sadournay et al. 1968; Heikes and Randall 1995a, 1995b; Thuburn 1997). It is highly unlikely that any single Geodesic DGGS will ever prove optimal for all applications. Many of the proposed systems include design innovations in particular areas, though their construction may have involved other, less desirable design choices. Therefore, rather than surveying individual Geodesic DGGSs as monolithic, closed systems, we will take the approach here of viewing the construction of a Geodesic DGGS as a series of design choices which are, for the most part, independent. The following five design choices fully specify a Geodesic DGGS: 1. A base regular polyhedron; 2. A fixed orientation of the base regular polyhedron relative to the Earth; 3. A hierarchical spatial partitioning method defined symmetrically on a face (or set of faces) of the base regular polyhedron; 4. A method for transforming that planar partition to the corresponding spherical/ ellipsoidal surface; and 5. A method for assigning points to grid cells. We will now look at each of these design choices in turn, discussing the decisions made in the develop- ment of a number of Geodesic DGGSs. Base Regular Polyhedron As White et al. (1992) and many others have observed, the spherical versions of the five platonic solids (Figure 2) represent the only ways in which the sphere can be partitioned into cells, each con- sisting of the same regular spherical polygon, with Figure 2. Planar and spherical versions of the five platonic solids: the tetrahedron, hexahedron (cube), octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. 124 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 125 the same number of polygons meeting at each vertex. The platonic solids have thus been commonly used to construct Geodesic DGGSs, although other regular polyhedra have some- times been employed. Among these the truncated icosahedron has proved to be popular (White et al. 1992). It should be noted, however, that an equivalently partitioned DGGS could be constructed using the icosahe- dron itself. The other regular polyhedra remain unexplored for DGGS construction, so we limit our discussion here to the platonic solids. In general, platonic solids with smaller faces reduce the distortion introduced when transforming between a face of the polyhedron and the corresponding spherical surface (White et al. 1998). The tetrahedron and cube have the larg- est face size and are thus relatively poor base approximations for the sphere. But because the faces of the cube can be easily subdivided into square quadtrees, it was chosen as the base platonic solid by Alborzi and Samet (2000). The icosahedron has the smallest face size and, therefore, any DGGSs defined on it tend to display relatively small distortions. The icosahedron is thus the most common choice for a base platonic solid. Geodesic DGGSs based on the icosahedron include those of Williamson (1968), Sadournay et al. (1968), Baumgardner and Frederickson (1985), Sahr and White (1998), White et al. (1998), Fekete and Treinish (1990), Thuburn (1997), White (2000), Song et al. (2002), and (with an adjustment as discussed in the next section) Heikes and Randall (1995a, 1995b). Dutton chose the octahedron as the base polyhedron for the Global Elevation Model (1984) and for the Quaternary Triangular Mesh (QTM) system (1999), while Goodchild and Yang (1992) based a similar system on it, and White (2000) used it as an alternative base solid. The octa- hedron has the advantage that it can be oriented with vertices at the north and south poles, and at the intersection of the prime meridian and the equator, Figure 3c. Spherical icosahedron (in Mollweide projection) oriented for symmetry about equator by placing poles at edge midpoints. Note the symmetry about the equator and the single vertex falling on land. Figure 3a. Spherical icosahedron (in Mollweide projection) oriented with vertices at poles and an edge aligned with the prime meridian. Note the lack of symmetry about the equator. Figure 3b. Spherical icosahedron (in Mollweide projection) oriented using Fuller’s Dymaxion orientation. Note that all vertices fall in the ocean. 124 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 125 aligning its eight faces with the spherical octants formed by the equator and prime meridian. Given a point in geographic coordinates, it is then trivial to determine on which octahedron face the point lies, but, because the octahedron has larger faces than the icosahedron, projections defined on the faces of the octahedron tend to have higher distortion (White et al. 1998). Wickman et al. (1974) observe that if a point is placed in the center of each of the faces of a dodecahedron and then raised perpendicularly out to the surface of a circumscribed sphere (“stellated”), each of the 12 pentagonal faces becomes 5 isosceles triangles. The stellated dodecahedron thus has 60 triangular faces compared to the 20 faces of the icosahedron, and an equal area projection can be defined on the smaller faces of the stellated dodecahedron with lower distortion than on the icosahedron (e.g., Snyder 1992). However, the triangular faces are no longer equilateral and therefore such a projection displays inconsistencies along the edges between faces. Polyhedron Orientation Once a base polyhedron is chosen, a fixed orienta- tion relative to the actual surface of the Earth must be specified. Alborzi and Samet (2000) oriented the cube by placing face centers at the north and south poles. White et al. (1992) oriented the trun- cated icosahedron such that a hexagonal face cov- ered the continental United States. Dutton (1984, 1999), and Goodchild and Yang (1992) oriented the octahedron so that its faces align with the octants formed by the equator and prime merid- ian. Wickman et al. (1974) oriented the dodecahe- dron by placing the center of a face at the north pole and a vertex of that face on the prime merid- ian, thus aligning with the prime meridian an edge of one of the triangles created by stellating the dodecahedron. In the case of the icosahedron, the most common orientation (Figure 3a) is to place a vertex at each of the poles and then align one of the edges emanating from the vertex at the north pole with the prime meridian. This orientation is used by Williamson (1968), Sadournay et al. (1968), Fekete and Treinish (1990), and Thuburn (1997). Heikes and Randall’s (1995a,b) icosahedron-based system was developed specifically for performing global climate change simulations. They note that in the common vertices-at-poles icosahedron placement (Figure 3a) the icosahedron is not symmetrical about the equator. When a simulation on a DGGS with this orientation is initialized to a state symmetrical about the equator, and then allowed to run, it evolves into a state that is asymmetrical about the equator, presumably due to the asymmetry in the underly- ing icosahedron. To counter this effect they rotate the southern hemisphere of the icosahedron by 36 degrees, and the resulting “twisted icosahedron” is symmetrical about the equator. Fuller (1975) chose an icosahedron orientation (Figure 3b) for his Dymaxion icosahedral map projection that places all 12 of the icosahedron vertices in the ocean so that the icosahedron can be unfolded onto the plane without ruptures in any landmass. This is the only known icosahedron orientation with this property. Note that one com- pact way of specifying the orientation of a platonic solid is by giving the geographic coordinates of one of the polyhedron’s vertices and the azimuth from that vertex to an adjacent vertex. For platonic solids this information will completely specify the position of all the other vertices. Using this form of specification, Fuller’s Dymaxion orientation can be constructed by placing one vertex at 5.2454 0W longitude, 2.3009 0N latitude and an adjacent one at an azimuth of 7.46658 0 from the first vertex. We note that if the icosahedron is oriented so that the north and south poles lie on the midpoints of edges rather than at vertices, then it is symmetrical about the equator without further adjustment. While maintaining this property we can minimize the number of icosahedron vertices that fall on land, following Fuller’s lead. The minimal case appears to be an orientation (Figure 3c) that has only one vertex on land, in China’s Sichuan Province. This orientation can be constructed by placing one vertex at 11.25 0E longitude, 58.28252 0N latitude and an adjacent one at an azimuth of 0.0 0 from the first vertex. Spatial Partitioning Method Once we have a base regular polyhedron, we must next choose a method of subdividing this polyhe- dron to create multiple resolution discrete grids. In the case of platonic solids one can define the subdivision methodology on a single face of the polyhedron or on a set of faces that constitute a unit that tiles the polyhedron, provided that the subdivision is symmetrical with respect to the face or tiling unit. Four partition topologies have been used: squares, triangles, diamonds, and hexagons. Alborzi and Samet (2000) performed an aperture 4 subdivision to create a traditional square quadtree on each of the square faces of the cube. We have observed that the preferred choices for base platonic solid[s] are the icosahedron, the octahedron, and the stellated dodecahedron, each of which has a triangular face. The obvious choice for a triangle is to subdivide it into smaller triangles. Like the square, an equilateral triangle can be divided into n 2 (for 126 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 127 any positive integer n) smaller equilateral tri- angles by breaking each edge into n pieces and connecting the break points with lines par- allel to the triangle edges (Figure 4). In geodesic dome litera- ture this is referred to as a Class I or alternate subdivision (Kenner 1976). Recursively sub- dividing the triangles thus obtained gener- ates a congruent and aligned DGGS with aperture n 2. Small apertures have the advantage of generat- ing more grid resolutions, thus giving applications more resolutions from which to choose. For congruent triangle subdivision the smallest possible aperture is 4 (n = 2). This aperture also conveniently parallels the fourfold recursive subdivi- sion of the square grid quadtree; many of the algorithms developed on the square grid quadtree are transferable to the triangle grid quadtree with only minor modifica- tions (Fekete and Treinish 1990; Dutton 1999). This subdivision approach (Figure 4) was used by Wickman et al. (1974), Baumgardner and Frederickson (1985), Goodchild and Yang (1992), Dutton (1999), Fekete and Treinish (1990), White et al. (1998), and Song et al. (2002). Congruent and unaligned Class I aperture 9 (n = 3) triangle hierarchies have been proposed by White et al. (1998) and Song et al. (2002). An aperture 3 triangle subdivision is also possible. In this approach, referred to as the Class II or tria- con subdivision (Kenner 1976), each triangle edge is broken into n = 2 m pieces (where m is a positive integer). Lines are then drawn perpendicular to the triangle edges to form the new triangle grid (Figure 5). The Class II breakdown is incongruent and unaligned. No Geodesic DGGSs have been proposed based on this partition, though the verti- ces of a Class II breakdown have been used as cell points by Dutton (1984) and by Williamson (1968) to construct a dual hexagon grid. Triangles have a number of disadvantages as the basis for a DGGS. First, they are not squares; they are thus a foreign alternative for many potential users, and they do not display as efficiently as squares on common output display devices that are based on square lattices of pixels. Like square grids, they do not exhibit uniform adjacency, each cell having three edge and nine vertex neighbors. Unlike squares, the cells of triangle-based discrete grids do not have uniform orientation; as can be seen in Figures 4 and 5, some triangles point up while others point down, and many algorithms defined on triangle grids must take into account triangle orientation. While the square is the most popular cell region shape for planar discrete grids, its geometry makes it unusable on the triangle-faced regular polyhedra that we have seen are preferred for constructing Geodesic DGGSs. However, White (2000) notes that pairs of adjacent triangle faces may be combined to form a diamond or rhombus, and this diamond may be recursively sub-divided in a fashion analogous to the square quadtree subdivision (Figure 6). When one begins with either the octahedron or icosahe- dron, this yields a congruent, unaligned Geodesic DGGS with aperture 4. Because diamond-based grids have a topology identical to square-based quadtree grids they can take direct advantage of the wealth Figure 4. Three levels of a Class I aperture 4 triangle hierarchy defined on a single triangle face. Figure 5. Three levels of a Class II aperture 3 triangle hierarchy defined on a single triangle face. 126 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 127 of quadtree-based algorithms. But like square grids, they do not display uniform adjacency. The hexagon has received a great deal of recent interest as a basis for planar discrete grids. Among the three regular polygons that tile the plane (tri- angles, squares, and hexagons), hexagons are the most compact, they quantize the plane with the smallest average error (Conway and Sloane 1988), and they provide the greatest angular resolution (Golay 1969). Unlike square and triangle grids, hexagon grids do have uniform adjacency; each hexagon cell has six neighbors, all of which share an edge with it, and all of which have centers exactly the same distance away from its center. Each hexagon cell has no neighbors with which it shares only a vertex. This fact alone has made hexagons increasingly popular as bases for discrete spatial simulations. Frisch et al. (1986) argue that the six discrete velocity vectors of the hexagonal lattice are necessary and sufficient to simulate continuous, isotropic, fluid flow. A recent textbook (Rothman and Zaleski 1997) on fluid flow cellular automata is based entirely on hexagonal meshes, with discussions of square meshes included “only for pedagogical calculations.” Triangle grids, which are even more insufficient for this purpose, are not mentioned. Studies by GIS researchers (Kimerling et al. 1999) and mathematicians (Saff and Kuijlaars 1997) indi- cate that many of the advantages of planar hexagon grids may carry over into hexagon-based Geodesic DGGSs. A hexagon-based grid has been adopted by the U.S. EPA for global sampling problems (White et al. 1992). And hexagon-based Geodesic DGGSs have been proposed at least four times in the atmospheric modeling literature (Williamson 1968; Sadournay et al. 1968; Heikes and Randall 1995a, 1995b; Thuburn 1997)—to our knowledge more often than any other Geodesic DGGS topology. It should be noted that it is impossible to completely tile a sphere with hexagons. When a base polyhedron is tiled with hexagon-subdivided triangle faces, a non-hexagon polygon will be formed at each of the polyhedron’s vertices. The number of such polygons, corre- sponding to the number of polyhedron vertices, will remain constant regard- less of grid resolution. In the case of an octahedron these polygons will be eight squares, in the case of the icosahedron they will be 12 pentagons. While single-resolution, hexagon-based discrete grids are becoming increasingly popular, the use of multi-resolution, hexagon-based discrete grid sys- tems has been hampered by the fact that congruent discrete grid systems cannot be built using hexagons; it is impossible to exactly decompose a hexagon into smaller hexagons (or, conversely, to aggregate small hexagons to form a larger one). Hexagons can be aggregated in groups of seven to form coarser- resolution objects which are almost hexagons (Figure 7), and these can again be aggregated into pseudo- hexagons of even coarser resolution, and so on. Known as Generalized Balanced Ternary (Gibson and Lucas 1982), this structure has become the most widely used planar multi-resolution, hexagon-based grid system. However, it has several problems as a general-purpose basis for spatial data structures. The first is that the cells are hexagons only at the finest resolution. Secondly, the finest resolution grid must be determined prior to creating the system, and once determined it is impossible to extend the system to finer resolution grids. Thirdly, the orientation of the tessellation rotates by about 19 degrees at each level of resolution. Finally, it does not appear to be possible to symmetrically tile triangular faces with such a hierarchy, which makes it unusable as a subdivision choice for a Geodesic DGGS. There are, however, an infinite series of apertures that produce regular hierarchies of incongruent, aligned hexagon discrete grids. It should be noted that, as these hierarchies are incongruent, they do not naturally induce hierarchical data structures which are trees, and thus common tree-based algorithms cannot be directly adapted for use on these hexagon hierarchies. But it should also be noted that, as indi- cated previously, traditional multi-resolution vector data structures such as the geographic coordinate system are also incongruent and aligned. This may indicate that hexagon grids are more appropriate for vector applications than congruent, unaligned triangle and diamond hierarchies. Figure 6. Three levels of an aperture 4 diamond hierarchy. The coarsest diamond resolution consists of two triangle faces as indicated. 128 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 129 Aperture 4 is the most common choice for hexagon-based DGGSs. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate aperture 4 hexagon subdivisions corresponding to the Class I and Class II symmetry axes, respectively. The DGGSs of Heikes and Randall (1995a) and Thuburn (1997) are Class I aperture 4 hexagon grids, while Williamson (1968) uses a Class II aperture 4 hexagon grid. As noted above, small apertures have the advantage of allowing more potential grid choices. Aperture 3 is the smallest aperture that yields an aligned hexagon hierarchy (Figure 10). In aperture 3 hierarchies the orienta- tion of hexagon grids alternates in successive resolutions between Class I and Class II. Aperture 3 hexagon Geodesic DGGS have been proposed by a number of researchers, including Sahr and White (1998). White et al. (1992) proposed hexagon grids of aperture 3, 4, or 7, and White et al. (1998) discussed hexagon grids of aperture 4 (Class I) and 9 (Class II). Sadournay et al. (1968) used a Class I hexagon grid of arbitrary aperture, which is incongruent and unaligned. We refer to this approach as an n-frequency hierar- chy. Note that it is possible to construct incongruent, unaligned n-frequency hierarchies using triangles and diamonds as well, though, to our knowledge, this has not been proposed. Figure 11 illustrates the most common partitioning methods defined on an icosahedron and projected to the sphere using the inverse Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) Projection (Snyder 1992). Transformation Once a partitioning method has been specified on a face or faces of the base polyhedron, a transfor- mation must be chosen for creating a similar topol- ogy on the corresponding spherical or ellipsoidal surface. There are two basic types of approaches (Kimerling et al. 1999). Direct spherical subdivision approaches involve creating a partition directly on the spherical/ellipsoidal surface that maps to the corresponding partition on the planar face(s). Map projection approaches use an inverse map projection to transform a partition defined on the planar face(s) to the sphere/ellipsoid. White et al. (1998) provide a comparison of the area and shape distortion that occurs under a number of different transformation choices. Perhaps the simplest approach is to perform the desired partition directly on the spherical surface, using great circle arcs corresponding to the cell edges on the planar face(s). The aperture 4 Class I triangle subdivision can be performed on the sphere by connecting the midpoints of the edges of the base spherical triangle and then, recursively performing the same operation on each of the resulting triangles. This technique was used by Baumgardner and Frederickson (1985) and Fekete and Treinish (1990). Dutton (1984) performed a Class II triangle subdivision on the surface of the octahedron and then adjusted the vertices to reflect the point elevations. While this straightforward approach works for creating an aperture 4 triangle subdivision, it is important to note that, in general, sets of great circle arcs corresponding to the edges of planar triangle partitions do not intersect in points on the surface of the sphere, as they do on the plane. More complicated methods are needed to form spherical partitions analogous to some of the other planar partitions we have discussed. Williamson (1968) used great circle arcs corre- sponding to two of the three sets of Class II triangle subdivision grid lines to determine a set of triangle vertices and then formed the last set of grid lines by connecting the existing vertices with great circle Figure 7. Seven-fold hexagon aggregation into coarser pseudo-hexagons. 128 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 129 arcs. These triangle vertices form the center points of the dual Class II aperture 4 hexagon grid (the cell edges of which are not explicitly defined). Sadournay et al. (1968) created an aperture m (where m = n 2 for some positive integer n) Class I triangle subdivision on the sphere by breaking each edge of the base spherical triangle into n segments and connecting the breakpoints of two of the edges with great circle arcs. These arcs are then subdivided evenly into segments corresponding to the planar subdivision. The resulting breakpoints form the centers of the dual Class I hexagon grid. Thuburn (1997) performed a Class I aperture 4 triangle sub- division and then calculated the spherical Voronoi cells of the triangle vertices to define the dual Class I aperture 4 hexagon grid. A number of researchers have attempted to adjust the grids created using great circle arcs to meet application-specific criteria. For instance, for many applications it would be desirable for the cell regions of each discrete grid resolution to be equal in area; the grids discussed above do not have this property. Wickman et al. (1974) began by connecting the midpoints of the base spherical triangle to form the first resolution of a Class I aperture 4 triangle grid. They then broke each of the new edges at the midpoint into two great circle arcs and adjusted the position of the breakpoint to achieve equal area quasi- triangles. This procedure is then applied recursively to yield an equal-area DGGS. Rather than using great circle arcs for triangle subdivision, Song et al. (2002) proposed using small circle arcs optimized to achieve equal cell region areas. Heikes and Randall (1995a) constructed a Class I aperture 4 hexagon grid by taking the spherical Voronoi of the vertices of a Class I aperture 4 triangle subdivision on their twisted icosahedron. They then adjusted the grid using an optimization scheme to improve its finite difference properties for use in global climate modeling. White et al. (1998) evaluated a number of methods for constructing triangle subdivisions on spherical triangles and observed that using appropriate inverse map projections to transform a subdivided planar triangle onto a spherical triangle may be more effi- cient than using recursively defined procedures.

Three levels of a Class II aperture 4 hexagon hierarchy defined on a single triangle face. 130 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 131 projection may be used, provided that it maps the straight-line planar face edges to the great-circle arc edges of the corresponding spherical face. There are at least four projections with this prop- erty. The common gnomonic projection has this property for all polyhedra but exhibits relatively large area and shape distortion. Snyder (1992) developed equal area projections defined on all of the platonic solids, but with greater shape distor- tion and more irregular spherical cell edges than the equal-area method of Song et al. (2002). On the icosahedron, the implementation of Fuller’s Dymaxion map projection (Fuller 1975) given in Gray (1995) also has the required property but with less area and shape distortion than the gnomonic projection and less shape distortion than Snyder’s icosahedral projection, though the Fuller/Gray projection is not equal area. Goodchild and Yang (1992) used a Plate Carree projection to project the faces of the octahedron to the sphere, and Dutton (1999) developed the Zenithial OrthoTriangular (ZOT) projection for the same purpose. White et al. (1998) constructed Class I aperture 4 and 9 triangle grids on planar icosahedral faces. They also constructed a Class I aperture 4 hexagon grid by taking the dual of the aperture 4 triangle grid and a Class II aperture 9 hexagon grid by aggregating the cells of the aperture 9 triangle grid. In all cases they transformed the resulting cells to the sphere, using direct spherical subdivision or the inverse gnomonic, Fuller/Gray, or Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) map projections. White et al. (1992) and Alborzi and Samet (2000) used the inverse Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection to project the faces of the truncated icosahedron and cube to the sphere. White et al. (1992) noted, however, that this projection does not map the straight-line planar face edges to the corresponding great-circle arc edges and, therefore, does not create a true Geodesic DGGS. Assigning Points to Grid Cells When specified, the points associated with grid cells are usually chosen to be the center points of the cell regions. If an inverse map projection approach is used to transform the cells from the planar faces to the sphere, then it is often conve- nient to choose the center points of the planar cell regions (which do not, in general, correspond to the cell region centroids on the Earth’s surface) so that the points form a regular lattice, at least on patches of the plane. If the cells are formed by direct spherical subdivision, the choice of points may be complicated by the counter-intui- tive behavior of great-circle arcs described above. Gregory (1999) discussed several alternatives for point selection in the case of direct spherical subdivision. Dutton’s (1984) GEM DGGS used points that are the vertices of a Class II triangle subdivision. As described in the previous sub-sec- tion, the hexagonal DGGSs of Williamson (1968), Sadournay et al. (1968), Heikes and Randall (1995a), and Thuburn (1997) all specify cell center points as the vertices of a dual spherical triangle grid. The hexagonal grid cell boundaries, when specified, are created by calculating the associated spherical Voronoi cells. Summary and Conclusions Table 1 summarizes the design choices that define each of the Geodesic DGGSs we have discussed. Note that the number of options employed to con- struct a Geodesic DGGS is actually rather small, and certain choices clearly predominate in the Figure 10. Three levels of an aperture 3 hexagon hierarchy defined on a single triangle face. Note the alternation of hexagon orientation (Class II, Class I, Class II, etc.) with successive resolutions. 130 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 131 existing designs. In particular, the icosahedron is clearly the popu- lar choice for a base polyhedron; it is used in 10 of the 16 listed grid designs. Methods based on direct spherical subdivision are employed by about half of the grid designs. Also popular are equal area transformations, which are used by six of the grids. The grid designs are almost evenly split between triangle and hexa- gon partitions, but the diamond partition is a recent design that may yet prove popular due to its direct relationship to the square quadtree. We have shown that a Geodesic DGGS can be specified through a very small number of design choices, each of which is relatively indepen- dent of the others. In effect, future Geodesic DGGS designers may pick- and-choose from the menu of design choices to construct a DGGS to meet their specific application needs. As an example, let us take each of the design decisions in turn and attempt to construct a good general-purpose Geodesic DGGS. First, due to its lower distortion characteristics we choose the icosa- hedron for our base platonic solid. We orient it with the north and south poles lying on edge midpoints, such that the resulting DGGS will be symmetrical about the equator. Next we select a suitable partition. The hexagon partition has numerous advantages, and we choose aperture 3, the smallest possible aligned hexagon aperture. Because equal-area cells are advantageous for many applications, we choose the inverse ISEA projec- tion to transform the hexagon grid to the sphere, and we specify that each DGGS point lies at the center of the corresponding planar cell region. We call the resulting grid the ISEA Aperture 3 Hexagonal (ISEA3H) DGGS.

More information on this and other ISEA-based Geodesic DGGSs may be found at http://www.sou.edu/cs/sahr/dgg. Directions for Further Research While such studies as White et al. (1998), Kimerling et al. (1999), Clarke (2002), and the current work have made significant steps in defining and evalu- ating existing DGGS alternatives there remain a number of areas that we believe require further research. First, it should be noted that additional research may reveal new design choice alterna- tives that are superior to those already proposed. In particular, we feel that further research into transformations for Geodesic DGGS definition is required. For example, a DGGS projection that is equal area, but has less shape distortion than the ISEA projection, would be very desirable. Additionally, the grids discussed here are defined with reference to the sphere; many applications will require more accurate definitions referenced to ellipsoids. And as specific grids are chosen for practical use efficient transformations must be defined that will allow data to be moved between grids while preserving data quality. Existing studies have treated DGGSs from the per- spective of the broader GIS community, but effective evaluation of design alternatives can only take place in the context of specific applications and end-user Figure 11. Three resolutions of icosahedron-based Geodesic DGGS’s using four partition methods: (a) Class I aperture 4 triangle, (b) aperture 4 diamond, (c) aperture 3 hexagon, and (d) Class I aperture 4 hexagon. 132 Cartography and Geographic Information Science Vol. 30, No. 2 133 communities. In particular, the computer data struc- tures community has yet to play a significant role in DGGS evaluation. Input from this community, which should play a key role in making appropriate design choices in the future, has been primarily limited to the adaptation of quadtree algorithms to aperture 4 triangle grids (in particular the QTM DGGS of Dutton (1999)). Hexagon-based Geodesic DGGSs, which have clear advantages for many end-users, remain largely ignored. A significant effort must be made by the data structures community to develop and evaluate algorithms for the regular, but non-tree, hierarchies they form.
