In his preface he described how he hesitated between two methods of presenting the state of Martian knowledge-in special chapters dealing with topics such as conti- nents, seas, polar caps, and so on; or chronologically, in the order in which the facts had been obtained. He at length decided on the latter approach, \"mainly;' he wrote, \"because it seemed to me to be the more interesting . . . and also because it . provides a better account of the gradual development of our knowledge.\" So it has seemed to me, and I have done likewise. What follows, then, is a history of Martian exploration from the earliest stirrings of human curiosity about the planet right up to the present time when, after a lull of twenty years and after suffering through the disappoint- ments of the Russian Phobos and American Mars Observer missions, we stand again poised on the verge of a more vigorous phase of ex- ploration of the planet. I MUST here acknowledge the help I have had in preparing this volume. Dr. Richard McKim, director of the Mars Section of the British Astronomical Association, and Thomas Dobbins were gen- erous in giving of their valuable time to read through the manu- script, and they made many helpful comments. So did two anony- mous reviewers for the University of Arizona Press. Dr. Patrick Moore very kindly put at my disposal one of only four existing copies of his English translation of Flammarion's La Planete Mars) which has been indispensable, and granted me permission to quote from it and from his earlier translations of the works of E . M. Anto- niadi. Drs. Audouin Dollfus and Henri Camichel provided much information about their own studies of Mars as well as about the work of other French pioneers-these were men who received the torch of the great Antoniadi. For help in tracking down material ( ix ) on G. V. Schiaparelli, I am grateful to Signor Luigi Prestinenza; and for permission to use material from th e Schiaparelli Archives, my thanks to Professor Guido Chincarini , director of the Osser- vato rio Astronomico di Brera. Dieter Gerdes, curator of the Hei- marvere in Lilienthal, was a valuable source of information about J. H. Schroeter. The help of Michael Sims of the Special Collection s of Vanderbilt University Archives , Dorothy Schaumberg of the Mary Lea Shane Arch ives of the Lick Observatory, and Judith Lola Bausch and Richard Dreiser of the Yerkes Observato ry is acknowl- edged. Though my interest in Mars began in my early youth (as has been the case for so man y who have been fired with enthusiasm about the planet), my scholarly habits were greatly sti mulated by my visit to Lowell Observatory in 1982. lowe much to the encour- agement of the late William Gra ves Hoyt, historian, whose own researches on Percival Lowell resonate in this volume, and Arthur Hoag, director of th e Lowell Observatory. Michael J. Crowe, of th e University of Notre Dame, also encouraged my research at an early stage. A number of astronomers shared their observations and ob- serving lore related to the red planet, especially Tom Cave, Tom Dobbins, Rodger Gordon, Walter Haas , Harold Hill , and Alan Lenham. Barry Di Gregorio scouted out information regarding the future spacecraft missions . Finally, I am grateful to Richard Baum for his inspiration over many years, and to my wife, Deborah, for helping me in more ways than I can name. WILLIAM SHEEHAN Hutchinson , Minnesota June 1995 ( x ) Preface Sun (inferior conjunction) or behind the Sun (superior conjunc- tion ). This behavior, as we now know, is du e to the fact that their orbits lie inside th at of th e Earth. The outer planets - Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn - can appear oppo- site th e Sun in the sky, a situation that is, of course, never possible for a planet th at is closer to the Sun th an the Earth . W hen planets appear thus, they are said to be at oppositio n. It is then th at they attain their greatest brilliance. They rise when th e Sun sets and set when the Sun rises, so th ey are highe st above the horizon at mid- night. Mars 's usual mot ion among th e stars is from east to west. Aro und th e time of oppos ition, however, it suddenly sto ps, reverses di- rection, and moves \"retrograde\" for a tim e, then sto ps again and resumes its usual motion from east to west. (Jupiter and Satu rn do thi s as well, but becau se they mo ve more slowly- and tra vel through smaller arcs-the movements are less obvious than in the case of Mars .) So baffling were these motions that Mars was the despair of the naked-e ye astronomers. The Roman Pliny, wh o per- ished while tr ying to observe (too closely) an eruption of Vesu- vius in A.D. 79, called it \" inobservabile sidus\" ; and at least one later astronomer who attempted to calculate th e motions of Mars is said to have becom e deranged in his mind, and in a fit of rage to have bumped his head against th e walls! 1 After completing a loop, Mars resume s its westward drift relative to the fixed stars. Its light grows gradually weaker as it approaches and finally passes behind th e Sun (into superior conjunction). It then emerges from the Sun into the morning sky and brightens again, until, after two years and two months, it comes on ce mo re into opposition and shines like a burning coal upon the night sky. T HE ANCI ENT Greeks took for granted th at the Earth was the center of the universe. They also assum ed that the plan ets moved uniformly in perfect circles. U nfortu nately, uniform motion around simple circles did not account for the complicated movements the Greeks actuall y observed, and they faced the problem of \"saving the phenomena\" - showing how the observed movements could be reconciled with the ir pr inciple of un iform circular motions. One ingeniou s scheme was introduced by Eudoxus of Cnidus, a mathematician and contempo rary of Plato (indeed, he stayed two ( 4 ) T H E P L A N E T MA RS ;.. I months in Athens as a pupil at the Academy, though much of his life was spent in Eg ypt). In the fourth century B.C., Eudoxus de- veloped his system of homocentric spheres, according to which the observed motion of a planet was produced by th e independent mo- tion s of several int ernested spheres, each centered on the Earth. The scheme was able to account for the retrograde movements well enough, but it did not explain why, if the spheres shared a common center, the planets varied in their brightness-in the case of Mars , some fiftyfold. The most obvio us explanation for the fluctua tions in brightness was that the Earth was no t the center of all the motions. By 250 B.C., Aristarchus of Samos, who at least from our modern perspective was the greatest of th e ancient astronomers, worked out a complete heliocentric system in which all the planet s circled the Sun . Aris- tarchus regarded th e Earth as an ordinary planet: it rotated on its axis once every twe nty-four hours, and it traveled in a circular path around the Sun with a period of one year. Wi th one bold stroke, he had solved th e problem of the retrograde movements, which were now seen to be reflections of the Earth's orbital motion - they are apparent displacement s as the planets are viewed from different points as th e Earth pursues its course around the Sun. Unfortunately, Aristarchus was too far ahead of his time , and the later Greeks did not follow his lead. His theory did not account exactly for th e observed motions, mainly because, as we now know, the orbits of th e planets are not exactly circular, as Aristarchus as- sumed. The most famo us Greek astronomers who lived after him , including Apollonius and Hipparchus, returned to the geocentric system. \\ In thei r hands the infamous system of epicycles took shape. Th e system received its greatest elaboration through the efforts of Claudius Pto lemy, who lived at Alexandria in the second century A.D. and worked it out in detail in his great book The Almagest (The greatest) -th us, the system of epicycles is more commonly known as the Ptolemaic system. Each planet was taken to move around a small circle known as an epicycle, which in turn moved around ala . Irger eire e (the deferent) centered on the Earth. The combined mot ion of its epicycle and deferent caused each planet to swing in near the Earth at ri h duciat times, t us pro ucmg the retrograde movements. Even apart from the retrograde mo vements, the planets had a vari- Motions of Mars ( 5 ) able motion along th e Zodiac; th us Ptolemy made th eir deferents slightly eccentric to the Earth. Even this did no t accoun t for the planets ' movements, howe ver, so Ptolemy took still greater liber- ties. He found a point, the punctum aequans, from which the planet's motion around the deferent would app ear un iform - it was located a short distance from the center in the opposite direction from the Earth (a construction known as the \"bisection of the eccentricity\"). In practical terms, this involved abandoning the principle of uni - form circular motions altogether, but it was brillian tly successful as a device for calculating the observed motions of the planets. Ptolemy's system, despite its artificiality, remained the last word in astronomy for a th ousand years. Although the Dark Ages fell on western Europe, pu tting an end to astronomical investigations there, astronomy was no t completely snuffed out. In the East , in Baghdad, Arab scienti sts continued to observe th e stars, and they also attempted to make minor adjustments in th e Ptolemaic th eory. O nly with the revival of learn ing in Europe, however, was real progress made. The all-important step was taken by N icolaus Cop ern icus, a Polish canon at the Cathedral of Frauenburg. Seven- teen centuries after th e scheme first occurred to th e far-sighted Arista rchus, Copernicus reintroduced the heliocent ric system. The Sun rather than the Earth was the center of the system, and once again the fact eme rged -especially eviden t in the case of Mars - that the retrograde movements were mere reflections of the Earth's own motion in its orbit. \"This happ ens;' wrote Co pernicus, \"by reason of the mo tio n, not of th e planet , but of th e earth chang- ing its position in its great circle. For since th e eart h moves more rapidly than the planet, the line of sight directed toward the firma- ment regresses, and th e eart h more th an neutralizes th e mo tion of the plane t. . . . T he inequality attains its maximum for each planet when th e line of sight to the planet is tangent to the circumference of the great circle.\"2 U nfortunately, like Aristarchus's successor s Copernicus found that his hypothesis of simple circular orbits aro und the Sun did no t agree exactly with th e obse rved movement s of th e plane ts, and he too was forced to introduce com plications, including bringing back th e cumbersome eccentric circles and epicycles, although in all fairness it mus t be admi tted that he reduced their number. H e ( 6) THE PLANET MAR S was also guilty of some surprising inconsistencies. Since the appar- ent motion of th e Sun-actually a reflection of the Earth's orbital motion-is variable during the year, it is convenient to introduce the con cept of th e mean Sun, whose po sition is defined by the average rate of the Sun 's annual mo tion. Copernicus referred the lanet ary mot ion s to the mean Sun rather than to the true Sun, and this forced him to assume that the Earth's orbit had a variable in- clination. Despite these shortcomings, he had grasped the essential point ; his great book De Revolutionibus Orbium Caelestium (On the revolutions of th e celestial spheres) is one of the immortal works of science. It appeared in 1543, the year of his death-it is said that the first cop ies reached him on his deathbed. Copernicus's wo rk did not find immediate acceptance. The fierc- est resistance came from theologians, but man y astronomers were also opposed to his views, includin g Tycho Brahe, the greatest astronomer of th e generation tha t came after Copernicus's death. Tycho was an entirely different sort of man from Copernicus. Whereas Copernicus was a th eorist first and foremos t and made only a few of his own ob servation s, Tycho was mainly an observer- one of the greatest who ever lived .' He was born in 1546, three years after Copernicus died . He was adopted at birth by a well-to-do uncle, who destined him for a career in statecraft and sent him at age sixteen to th e University of Copenhagen to stu dy law. W hile there, on August 21, 1560, Tycho witnessed a partial eclipse of th e Sun, and it changed th e direction of his life. The date of the eclipse had been pr edicted by astronomers, and Tycho, as his early biographer Pierre Gassendi wro te, \"thought of it as divin e th at men cou ld kno w the motion s of th e stars so accurately that the y could long before foret ell their places and rela- tive positions:' Before long, he had obtained a copy of Ptolemy's Almagest and worked throu gh it. H is uncle disapproved of these stu dies and sent him away from D enm ark, entering him instead at the University of Leipzig with a tutor named Vedel to look after him. Unfortunately, th e move was to no avail; Tycho was nothing if not strong-willed . H e studied law during the day, and at nig ht, while Vedel slept, sto le out to view the stars. By now Tycho had realized th at astronomical tables were no t as accurate as he had at first supposed, and also that their refo rm de- Motions of Mars (7 ) pended on obtaining more accurate observations. T his is what he resolved to do . Not long afterward, his uncle died, and there was no longer anything standing in his way. From Leipzig, Tycho went to the Un iversity of Rostock. D ur- ing his time there he became engaged in a heated argument with a colleague over a mathematical point. The y decided to sett le th eir dispute by fighting a duel, which ended with Tycho having part of his nose cut off (he promptly replaced it with a new one made of copper and wax). From Rosto ck he went to the University of Basel, then finally returned to Denmark and established a private observa- tory at H erre Vad, on the estate of ano ther well-to-do uncle . At Herre Vad, Tycho observed a brilliant new star, or nova , which appeare d in the constellation Cassiopeia in 1572. It remained con- spicuous for a time, then began to fade, but during the period when it was visible Tycho was able to show that it was exceedingly re- mo te: to all intents and pur poses, it was located in the sphere of th e \"fixed\" stars. T he book he wrote about th e star made him famous, and soon after it was pu blished he received from King Frederik II of Denma rk an offer he could not refuse. Frederik granted Tycho the use and revenues of Hven, an island in the Baltic between Elsi- nore and Copenhagen. Tycho accepted, and in 1576 set up the most splen did observatory in Europe. The instruments th ere were th e best of their day, though needless to say, all were meant to be used for naked-eye observations because the telescope had not yet been invent ed. For the next twenty years, Tycho worked at compiling a star cata- log whose position s could be trusted to within two or th ree minutes of arc, and built up an extensive archive of careful observations of the planets, including Mars, which he observed at every opposition beginning with tha t of 1580 . In 1583, he noted that near opposition Mars moved retrograde at a rate of nearly half a degree a day; thi s proved th at Mars could approach much closer to th e Earth than the Sun, which was true in th e Copernican system but not the Ptole- maic. Nevertheless, Tycho was still not enti rely satisfied with the ideas of Copernicus. He adop ted a compromise position, known as th e Tychonic system, in which the Earth remained at the cen- ter; the planets went around the Sun, while the Sun in turn circled th e Earth. It is often said that Tycho was an ill-tempered, quarrelsome man . ( 8) TH E PLANET MAR S Unfortunately, th is seems actually to have been the case; and he 1 0 an imperious landlord - he was intensely disliked by nearlywas a s re on th e island and after Frederik's death the Danish courteveryOl , fit to cut off his funds. In 1596 , Tycho left H ven , taking along saW . . . h him his observations as well as the more portable of his 10 -Wit I rs H e went first to Germany, and then , at the invitationstrumen . of the Emperor Rudolph II of the Holy Roman Empire, settled at Prague , in Bohemia . The terr ible religious wars between Protes- tants and Catholics were then in full swing, and in 1600 Tycho was joined by a young Protestant ~a~hematician,Joh~nes Kepler, who had been expelled from his position as mathematician at Graz , Aus- tria, because his religion differed from that of the Catholic Arch- duke Ferdinand. At th at particular time, Tycho and another assis- tant , Christian Severinus (or Longomontanus, as he styled himself), were working on th e theory of the mo tion of Mars, and Kepler was assigned to the same monumental task. Kepler later remarked that \"had Christian been occupied with some other planet, I wo uld have been started on th e same one,\":' Tycho, who was touchy and jealous of his observations, gave Kepler limited access to his records, and the ir relatio nship was un- doubtedly strained at times. Miraculously, they managed to avoid a complete break, and on Octo ber 24, 1601, Tycho died suddenly, of a bladder ailment. (His last words were, \"Let me no t seem to have lived in vain.\") Kepler was appointed to succeed him, and Tycho's instruments and hoard of observations fell into his hands. At last able to work freely, Kepler retu rned with a will to his studies of Mars. Unlike Tycho, Kepler had always been a confirmed Copernican. But where Cop ernicus had taken the mean Sun rather than the true Sun as the center of th e planetary motions, Kepler at once correc ted him by making th e plane of the Earth's orbit pass through the true Sun. He was rewarded for his consistency with the discover y that the orbit of Mars was inclined to the Earth's by a constant angle of 1 Â° 50' (rather th an by th e variable angle Copernicus had been forced to introduce), whereup on Kepler exclaimed, \"Copernicus did not know his own riches!\" H e next attempted to recalculate the orbit of Mars by referring it, too, to the true Sun. He began by assum- ing that the planet's or bit was circular but that the speed along this circle was variable. Using Tycho's observations of Mars from 1587, Motions of Mars (9) 1591 , 1593 , and 1595, he struggled to empirically locate a punctum aequans. After numerous trials, he almo st succeeded ; he produced a theory in which the discrepancy with Tycho's observations was never more than eight minutes of arc at any point around th e orbit. This would have satisfied mo st men, but Kepler had supreme con - fidence in Tycho 's ob servations, and he rejected thi s first the ory, which he henceforth referred to as his \"vicarious hypothesis.\" Kepler was not greatl y disappointed, since he had never cared for the concept of a punctum aequans. Thinking in physical terms, he could no t understand why th e motion of a planet should take place with respect to an empty mathematical point. Instead, he believed that the plane ts moved owing to a force emanating from the Sun. This was only reasonable; after all, their velocity was greatest when they were nearest the Sun and slowe st when they were farthe st away from it. More precisely, Kepler showed that the radius vector (the line connecting the planet to the Sun) sweeps out equal areas in equal times. T his concep t has become known as Kepler's second law of planetary motion, though it was actually th e first he discovered. This discovery greatl y simplified his calculations, but his main goal - the shape of the Martian orbit-still eluded him . After aban- doning the vicarious hypothesis, he resolved to attempt to trace the shape of the orbit without any preconception as to wha t that might be. His first task was to reexamine the Earth's own mo tion around the Sun. By considering two of Tycho's observations of Mars in which the planet had been at the same place, but regarding them from the point of view of an observer on Mars rather than Earth , Kepler was able to show that Earth's orbit was as eccentric as th ose of the other planets. With th is information at his command, he con- structed tables giving exact distances and longitudes of the Sun, and then, finally, worked out the Mars -Sun distances. Since Mars takes 687 days to orbit the Sun, it will, if measured on two dates 687 days apart, have returned to the same point in its orbit; but the Earth, which completes each revolution in 365.26 days, will be at two dif- ferent positions for the measurements. If one knows the angle that Mars makes relative to the Sun at these two points, one can define the Sun -Mars distance in terms of the Sun -Earth distance . In this way Kepler was able to calculate the distance of M ars from the Sun at various points in its orbit. Each time, he found th at the distance was less than it would have been had the orbit been (10) T H E P LAN ET MAR S circular. This suggested that the orbit was an oval of so me kind. In orde r to simp lify his calculations, he began to use the more trac- table ellipse as an auxiliary device, on one occasion even writing to his friend, the able observer David Fabricius, that if th e orbit actually were an ellipse, the mathematical problem wo uld already have been solved by Archimedes and Apollonius. At the moment he could take the matter no further. His effort s were heroic, and at times he came close to ruining his health. Indeed, he became so worn out that he decided to take off a wh ole year, 1603 , and seek relaxatio n in researches into optics. On returning to the \"war with Mars \" in early 1604, Kepler de- cided to use Tycho 's ob servation s to plot the planet'S position in its orbit at tw enty-two different points. When he did so, he found that all the points fell within the eccentric circle of the vicarious hy- pothesis and left a crescent, or lune , on each side between the orbit and the circle itself. He was still thinking that the shape of the orbit had to be an oval of some sort. He noticed that, relative to a circular orbit of radius I , the distance to the lune at its greatest breadth mea- sured 1.00429 . To the casual reader this mean s nothing, but Kepler had agonized over th e orbit of Mars for six years. In his calculations using his areal law, he had made frequent use of the so -called opti- cal equation of Mar s, which gives the angle between th e Sun and the center of Mars's orbit as seen from the Earth; at this moment he happened to notic e (by sheer chan ce, he said, but his mind had been well pr epared) th at for th e maximum value of this angle, 5Â° 18', the ratio known as th e secant is equal to 1. 0 0 4 2 9 . This was the break- through he had needed. \"I awoke as from a sleep \" he exclaimed, , \"a new light broke upon me;' He now grasped the relationship be- tween th e cent er of Mars's orbit and the distance of Mars from the Sun at the lune's widest point, and assumed that th is relationship must hold true for any po int in the orbit. After a few more trials, he came to his great discover y: the equation that correctly describes the orbit of Mars is that of an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus. Kepler realized that what held true for Mars must hold true for the other planets: they too must follow elliptical paths. But he also had been fortunate; had he worked on the motions of any other planet, he wo uld never have made this discovery. Apart from Mer - cury, which is difficult to observe because of its proximity to the Sun, Mars has the most eccentric orbit of the planets known dur- Motions of Mars ( II) ing Kepler 's time . H ad he begun, say, with the motion of Venus, whose orbit is nearly circular, the solution would doubtless have remained beyond his grasp. Thus Kepler saw it as nothing less th an providential th at when he had joined Tycho in Prague, Longom on- tanus had been wo rking on Mars. \"In order to be able to arrive at understanding;' he wro te, \"it was absolutely necessary to take the motion of M ars as the basis, otherwise the se secrets would have re- mained eternally hidden.\" 5 Kepler had discovered his first two laws of planeta ry motion by 160S, and had also finished his great book , New Astronomy, . , Commentar ies on the Motions of Ma rs.6 To Emperor Rudolph he an- nounced in a fittingly martial metaphor th e triumph to wh ich he had been led by his unfailing faith in Tycho's observations and his own relentless efforts: I bring to Your Majesty a noble prisoner whom I have captu red in the difficult and wearisome war entered upon under Your aus- pices. . . . Hitherto, no one had more completely got th e better of human inventions; in vain did astronomers prepare every- thing for the battle; in vain did the y draw upon all their resources and put all th eir troops in the field. Mars, making game of their efforts, destroyed their machines and ruined their experiments; unperturbed, he took refuge in the impenetrable secrecy of his empire, and concealed his masterly prog ress from the pursuits of the enem y. . . . For my part, I must, above all, praise the activit y and devotion of the valiant captain Tycho Brahe, who, under the auspices of Frede rik and Christian , sovereigns of Denmark, and then under the auspices of Your Majesty, every night throughout twenty successive years studied almost without respite all the habits of the enemy, exposing the plans of his campaign and discovering the mysteries of his progress. The ob servations, which he be- queathed to me, have greatly helped to banish the vague and indefinite fear that one experiences when first confronted by an unknown enemy? Kepler hoped to win support from Rudolph to extend his in- vestigatio ns to the other planets. Rudolph was chronically short of funds , howeve r, and did not have enough money to fight all his battles on Earth, let alone among the stars; even the money to pub- ( 12 ) T H E P LA N E T M AR S K I 's book on Mars was not immediately forthcoming, and \\ish ep er ranee was delayed until 1609Â· its appea I t of Kepler's life was full of trials. Hi s salary was con- The res , . , , all ' rrears his first wife suffered from epileptic seizures and nnu Y10 a , di d and his three children succumbed to smallpox. By 1612 finally Ie , . . If had become a battleground, and Kepler fled to Linz , Prague itse , In spite of it all Kepler continued his laborious calcu- in Austna. ' , . , d in 1619 announced the discover y of his third law of lation s, an I motion - th e so -called harmonic law: \"The square of the planetary . . ' period of revolution is proportional to the cube of the mean dis- tance from the Sun.\" The importanCe of thi s law is that it holds the key to the scale of the solar system. The relative distances of the planets from the Sun can be determined from their periods. If the periods are ex- pressed in Earth years, th e distances follow imme~ately.in terms of the Earth-Sun distance (which equals I astronomical unit, or I a.u.; thus for Mars, which has a period of 1.881 Earth years and lies at a mean distance from th e Sun OfI .S24 a.u., 1.881 2 = 1.S24 3 = 3.S38) . In 1626, Linz came under siege and Kepler was forced to flee again. Eventually he found refuge at the court of the general-in- chief of the armies of th e Holy Roman Empire, Albrecht von Wallenstein, at his newly formed du chy of Sagan, in Silesia. A year later, Kepler published his long-awaited tables of planetary motion, the Rudolphine Tables) named for his former patron, who had died in 1612. But chroni c financial worries and overwork were beginning to tell on him. Finally, in October 1630, he set out on a trip from Sagan to Regensburg, where he hoped to confer with the emperor about yet another residen ce, but the trip proved too much for him , and after a short illness he died on November IS , 1630. KEPLER'S LAWS contain essential facts about the planetary mo- tion s. However, th ey were emp irically derived from Tycho Brahe's observations. It was not unt il later that Isaac Newton, in his ma- jestic Principia of 1687, was able to derive them from a physi- cal theory-his principle of universal gravitation. According to Newton, every body in th e universe attracts every other body with a force th at is proportional to the amount of matter (mass) each COntains and to the inverse square of the distance between them. In the simple two-body case, such as a planet orbiting the Sun or a Motions of Mars ( 13) satellite or biting its primary planet , the motion of the one around the other is essentially a Keplerian ellipse; but of course matters are no t so simp le-every planet disturbs the motion of every other, so that when one gets down to the details the actual mo tions are very complicated. Mars 's motions are now well known. The elliptical path in whi ch it moves is such tha t its distance from the Sun varies from 206 .5 mil- lion kilometers at its closest (perihelion) to 249 .1 million kilom eters at its farthe st (aphelion). The mean distance is 22 7.9 million kilo- mete rs. The planet completes each revolution in about 68 7 days- 686 .98 days to be exact. Because of the gravitational pull of the Sun and planets on th e tidal bulge in the equator of Mars, its orbit gradually changes over time; th e posi tion of its perihelion slow ly rotates in space, and the shape of its ellipse is also variable- the current value of the eccen- tricity is 0.093 (compared with 0. 017 for the Earth), but over a period of two million years it ranges between 0.00 and 0 .13. I shall have mo re to say about the consequences of the se orbital varia- tions later. At opposition, Mars and th e Earth lie on the same side of their orbits fro m th e Sun, and th e tw o planets make th eir closest ap- proaches to one ano ther (because of the slight tilt of Mars's orbit relative to tha t of the Earth, the closest approach of the planet may actually occur as much as ten days from opposition). Since the Earth completes each orbit around the Sun in 365.26 days and Mars in 686 .98 days, the Earth will overtake and pass Mars on an aver- age of once every 779.74 days (this is known as the synodic per iod ; th e actual interval betw een op posi tio ns may, however, be as little as 764 days and as much as 8ro days). If the meeting occurs when Mars is near perihelion, the distance of appro ach will be only 35 million miles (56 million km); if it occurs when Mars is near aphelion, the distance will be mo re than 61 million miles (roo million km ). Since the time between oppo- sitions is longer than the Martian year, successive oppositions are displaced around the or bit of Mars-hence the perihelic opposi- tions are separated from one another by an interval of fifteen or seventeen years (see appendixes I and 2). The last perihelic opposi- tion was on September 28, 1988, when th e minimum distance was 36,545,600 miles (58,812,900 km ); the next will be on August 28, ( 14 ) THE P LAN E T MAR S 3 when Mars will make a closer approach to the Earth than 200 , at any tim e in the last several thousand years- it will come within 4,645 ,500 miles (55, 756,600 km ). 3 Th e orie ntation of the Martian orbit in space is such that the longitu de of its perihelion cur rently lies at 336.06 Â°, that iS~in t~e~i- . n of the constellation Aquarius. The Earth passes this POlOt 10rectiO s ace in late August each year, and thus perihelic oppositions always :c ur in August or September, when Mars is either in Aquarius itself or in nearb y Capricorn. The planet th en lies well to the sout h of the celestial equator, so that these oppositions are best obse rved from sou therly latitu des. The reverse is true of the aphelic oppo- sitio ns, which occur around the time the Earth passes the Martian aphelion (in Leo) in late February -these are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere. The difference in the size of Mars is signifi- cant ; the apparent diameter of the disk ranges from 25.1\" at the perihelic oppositions to only 13.8\" at the aphelic ones. It follow s that the perihelic oppositions-c-rszz, 1892, 1909 , 1924, 1939, 1956, 1971, 1988, etc.-rep resent the mo st favorable opportunities for the study of the planet, and these have generally been banner years in the history of Martian exploration. THOU GH THE motions of Mars were worked out accuratel y by Kepler, nothing had yet been learned about Mars itself-a telescope was needed for th at. By a strange coincidence, in 1609, the same year Kepler publi shed his Commentaries on the Motions of Mars, the first telescop es were tu rn ed toward the sky. For the first time astrono- mers could begin to ponder not on ly how the planets moved but also wh at kind of worl ds they were. A new era of Martian research had begun. Motions of Mars ( 15) live on. His account may have inspired the later fancies of Jona than Swift and Voltaire; and indeed, as we now know, th e planet actu- ally does have two satellites, though Kepler had no way of knowing this and merely made a lucky gues s. IN THE 20X instrument that Galileo used to make his first astro - nomical discoveries, Mars, even when closest to the Earth, would appear about the same size as a pea held at a distance of 8 feet (2-4 m). This and other early telescopes used a simple convex lens as the objec tive and a concave lens as the eyepiece, and had an inconveniently small field of view even at low power. Moreover, they suffered badly from spherical and chromatic aberrations. When light passes through a lens of spherical curva ture, the rays near the periphery tend to focus at a point closer to the lens than th ose near the center-thus the image can never be brought into sharp focus . This is spherical aberration. Chromatic aber ration occurs be- cause light passing through the lens is broken into all the colors of the spectrum, and the different colors come to a focus at differ- ent points. This produces prismatic splendors around bright obje cts such as the Moon or Venus. Both types of aberra tions are more no ticeable in the ligh t that passes through the outer parts of the lens. For th is reason - and also because his lenses were by no means accur ately figured - Galileo resorted to using cardboard rings in front of the object glasses so that the light would pass thro ugh only the central part of the lens, where th e figure was most uniform. Others attempted to improve the telescope and rid it of the se faults . There was tremendous enthusiasm at the time, and many hoped to emulate Galileo's discoveries. As early as 16II, Kepler, in his Dioptrics, had proposed using a convex instead of a concave lens for the eyepiece. This is the basic idea of wha t became known as the astronomical telescope (as opposed to the Ga lilean, or Dutch, telescope). The field of view is much larger in the astronomical tele- scope, and although the image is inverted, this is of little importance in astronomical observations; in any case, that can be rectified by adding another lens. Unfortunately, Kepler did not actually attempt to build such a telescope, and his ideas remained little known. Ap - parently, the first person to actually use an astronomical telescope was a Jesuit astronomer named Chris toph Scheiner, in 1617; oth er (18 ) THE PLANET MAR S telescopes were buil t during the 1630S by Francesco Fontana, a Nea- olitan lawyer and keen amateur astronomer. p With one of his telescopes, Fontana in 1636 produced a crude drawing of Ma rs. In this drawing the disk is shown as perfectly cir- cular, and at th e center is a dark spot wh ich he described as loo king like a \"black pill.\" T his black pill has sometimes been taken to repre - sent one of th e actua l spots on the surface of the planet, but no t so. Fontana later drew a similar black spo t on Venus (he even used the same wo rd, pill) to describe it), so there can be no doubt that the spot was th e result of an op tical defect in his telescope. Two years later, on Aug ust 24, 1638, Fontana made ano ther drawing of Mars. Th e disk is shown as markedly gibbous in this drawing - much more so, in fact, than the planet can ever actually appear to be-and the black pill appears again, with a phase proportional to that of the disk,\" Although Fontana accomplished little of lasting signi ficance, his drawings of Ma rs mark the beginning of what Cam ille Flam- marion, in La Planete M ars) called the first period of the history of the planet? The drawing s made during this first period, which lasted until 1830, are rudimentary and give no real idea of the physi - cal constitution of the planet. We may marvel at th e observers' slow progress, but we must also remember tha t Mars is a difficult object to observe. It is a small planet-its diameter is 4 ,238 miles (6, 780 km), only one-half that of th e Earth -and it is always more than 140 times farther away from Earth than the Moon . Excep t during the peri ods when it is very near th e Earth, its disk is always small, and details are not easy to see. Though Fontana cann ot have made out any of the actual spots on Mars, others using better telescopes succeeded in doing so. A tantalizing glimp se was ob tained by a Neapolitan Jesuit named Father Bartoli, wh o on December 24, 1644, described two patches on the lower part of the disk. More observations of patches were reported in 1651, 1653, and especially in July and August 1655, when Mars was near a perihelic opposition, by Giambattista Riccioli and Francesco Grimaldi, Jesuits of the Collegia Romano. But the true credit must go to Christiaan Huygens, the great Dutch astronomer (fig. I). Pioneers (19) Woo E D BY Louis XIV, who wanted to add to the renown of th e Academi c des Sciences, Huygens left Holland for Paris in 1666 and took up quarters in th e Bibl iotheque de Roi . He would remain in France as the most prestigious memb er of th e Academic for the next fifteen years. Three years later, Cassini was also dr awn to France by th e Sun King in order to lead the newly founded Paris Ob servatory. On first arriving in Paris, Cassini found that detailed plans for the observatory had already been dr awn up by Claude Perrault, the architect responsible for design ing the new facade at the Louvre. Cassini, who had an astronomer's eye rathe r than an architect's, ob- jected strongly to the plans. Eventually a meeting was arranged be- tween Cassini and Perrault, with the king and his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, also on hand. Cassini's great-grandson Jean Dominique Cassini IV later described the meeting: Perrault eloquently defended his plan and architectural style with beautiful sentences . My great-grandfather spoke French very poorly, and in defending the cause of astronomy he shocked the ears of the King, Colbert, and Perrault to such a point that Perrault in the zeal of his defense said to the King: \"Sire, this windbag doesn't know what he is talking about.\" My great- grandfather kept silent and did well. The King agreed with Per- rault and did badly. The result is th at the observatory has no common sense.IS Undaunted, Cassini set up the I7-foot (5.2-m) Campani telescope he had brought with him from Italy in the courtyard outside the observatory and set to work-with brilliant results. In 1671, with thi s telescope , he discovered a satellite of Saturn, Iapetus. A year later, with a 34-foot (ro.a-rn) Campani telescope, he added ano ther, Rhea. Even these telescopes must have been difficult to handle; Cassini mounted the Campani lenses in light wooden tubes, which he suspended from a high mast on the observatory terrace . Lat er, he began using even longer telescopes, and in 1684 he discovered two more satellites of Saturn, Dione and Tethys, with Cam pani telescopes of 100- and 136-foot (30.4- and 4I. 5-m) focal lengths mounted atop an old wooden wate r tower wh ich he had had trans- ported to the obse rvatory. The tower was equipped with a stairway and also had a balcony around the top to prevent his assistants from falling off on dark nights! (24 ) TH E P LANE T M AR S The two greatest observational astronomers of the age some- times observed to gether, and both made important observations of Mars at the perihelic oppos ition of September 1672. Huygens made another drawing of the planet which shows Syrtis Major unmis- takably, and also drew the first clear representation of the brilliant south polar cap. (It is often said that Cassini deserves credit for the discovery of the polar caps because one of his drawings from 1666 shows bright patches at the poles; however, I am not convinced, since the same drawing also shows bright patches of the same sort at both limbs.) Cassini concerned himself less with making physi- cal observations of the planet than with measuring its position relative to the stars. By comparing his results with those obtained by another French astronomer, Jean Richer, who had traveled to Cayenne, French Guiana, Cassini worked ou t the parallax of Mars, which in 1672 was two and a half times greater th an that of the Sun. This gave the distance to M ars, and from Kepler's harmonic law (which, as noted earlier, relates th e distances of the planets to their periods of revolution) he was able to work out the value of the astro- nomical unit, the distance from the Earth to the Sun. In fact, th ere were large errors in the measurements, and Cassini was lucky that the distance he calculated, 87 million miles (140 million km), was as close to the actual value (92,955,800 miles, or 149,597,870 km) as it was.\" In the 1680s, Huygens returned to Holland to escape the per- secution of Protestants that had arisen in an increasingly militant Catholic France. (Cassini,who remained a good Catholic, was never in danger; indeed, to the end of his life-he died in 1712-he re- mained a supporter of th e Tychonic system rather than the Coper- nican, which had been condemned by the church.) In Holland, Huygens settled on a country estate at Hofwjick, near The Hague, and continued his efforts to improve the telescope. Chromatic aberration had been the plague of observers from Galileo' tis ime onward. Instru ment makers naturally wanted to pro- duce telescopes with larger apertures, but when they tried to do so, they found that the chromatic aberration became even worse . Eventually it c,I was found that by making the curvature of the lens shallower and ' C al l. ItS roc ength longer, the effect of chromatic aber- ration could b d d ThH ere uce. us telescopes grew longer and longe r. uygens produced some of th e first long telescopes, and his dis- Pioneers (25 ) coveries inspired the even longer telescopes ofJohannes Hevelius, a brewer and city councillor of Danzig (now Gdansk) , which reach ed lengths of 60, 70, and even IS O feet (18.2, 21.3, and 45. 7 m); th ey were destroyed by the great fire at Danzig in 1679. Such telescopes we re extremely unwieldy and difficult to use , and Huygens himself decided to turn his attention to tubeless, o r \"aerial:' telescopes, in which the object glass was fixed to the top of a tall mast and th e observer sighted along guy wires, which could be used to point th e object glass in any desired direction. Bright objects such as planets could be found either by receiving them on a white pasteboard rin g fixed around the eyep iece, which the observer held by hand, or, more conveniently, by receiving them on an oiled and translucent paper screen (fainter objects obviously posed much greater difficul- ties). The object glass was illuminated by a lantern, and the ob server searched for the lantern's reflection in order to bring the lenses into alignment. In 1686, Huygens produced objectives with diam eters of 7.5, 8, and 8.5 inches (19, 20, and 22 cm); their focal lengths we re 123, 170, and 2IO feet, respectively (37.5, 51.8, and 64 m). He used them to observe the perihelic opposition of Mars in 1686, though his sketches show no more detail than that recorded in his earlier sketches made with more modest instruments. His very last sketch of the planet was made on February 4, 1694, with Mars at an aphelic opposition. Huygens died in 1695. WITH HUYGENS'S passing , the great century of discovery came to a close. Astronomy had made tremendous strides, though rela- tively little had been learned about Mars. It was known to have vari- ous dark and light patches, and there were hints that these might change over time. As early as 1666, Cassini had suggested that, seen from a great distance, our globe would resemble the other planets. Following up a remark by Galileo, he had predicted that the seas would appear da rk because they absorb sunlight, and the continents would appear bright. However, he stopped short of applying this explanation to the perceived differences in the Martian globe. In 1686, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle first published his charming Entretienssur la pluralitÂ«des mondes (Conversations on the plurality of worlds), in which he speculated about the conditions of life and the nature of the inhabitants of the Moon, Mercury, and Venu s. H e gave cursory attention to Mars, however, saying o nly that \"M ars has (26) TH E P LAN E T MA R S hi g cu rious that I know of; its days are not quite an hour longer not III ur s and its years the valu e o f two of ours. It's smaller than th an a , ., E rrh it sees the Sun a little less large and bnght than we see It;the a , . M ars isn't worth th e trouble of stopping there .\" 17 A far cry III sum, . from the rich speculations that would gather around ~e .p~anet III dl'ng centuries ! As yet, Mars, seen through the pnmltIve tele- succee of th at era had proved too unrewarding an o bject to piquescopes , much interes t. In the last years of his life, Huygens att empted to formulate his own ideas about extraterrestrial life, and \" as they came into his head . . . clapt them down into common places.\" 18 The result was his Kosmotheoros, which was finished by January 1695, though its author's death six months later delayed its publication until 1698. Huygens declared that the planets must have vegetation and ani- mals, because without such life \"we should sink them below the Earth in Beauty and Dignity; a thing that no Reason will permit.\" 19 Though Mars, because of its greater distance from the Sun, would be much cooler than the Earth, Huygens felt that the inhabitants would be adapted to their conditions. Its rotation, he declared, was established wi th out question from the movements of its spots, and proved to be similar to that of the Earth, while its axis seemed to be only slightly inclined to the plane of its orbit, so that there would not be much difference in the seasons for its inhabitants. Beyond this, there was little more to be said about the planet. The situation, alas, was unlikely to change very rapidl y. The aerial telescopes used by Huygens in the last years of the seven- teenth century admitted little development beyond what they had achieved in their inventor's hands, and they were cumbersome and difficult to use . Huygens had bequeathed his aerial telescopes to the Royal Society of London, but they were scarcely ever used. The I23-foo t (37.s-m) telescope was o ccasionally dusted off, but the re- sults were no t encouraging . \"Those here that first tried to make use of th is Glass:' one of the members wrote in a note to the Philosophi- cal Transactions of the Royal Society in 1718, findi ng for want of Practice, som e difficulties in the Manage- ment thereof, were the o ccasion of its being laid aside for some time. Afterwards it was designed for making perpendicular Ob - servations of the fixt Stars passing by our Zenith, to try if the Pioneers ( 27 ) Parallax of the Earths annual Orb mig ht not be made sensible in so great a Radius, according to what Dr H ook had long since proposed: but in this we miscarried also, for want of a place of sufficient height and firmness, whereon to fix the Object Glass, so that it lay by neglected for many Years.'? Clearly, aerial telescopes did not encourage protracted labor at the eyepiece, and it is little wonder that results were so meager over the next three quarters of a century-a period that deserves to be re- garded as the \"long night\" of Martian studies. ( 28 ) THE P LAN E T MAR S \"A Situation Similar to Ours\" When Giovanni Domenico Cassini became blind in 1710 (he died two years later), his son Jacques took charge of th e Paris Ob- servatory. Indeed, the Cassinis were destined to become one of the most remarkable astronomical families in history. Jacques (Cas- sini II ) was succeeded by his son, Cesar-Francois Cassini, who is also known as Cassini de Thury (Cassini III), who in turn was succeeded by his son, Jacques Dominique Cassini (Cassini IV). In politics, the family remained strongly royalist in its sympathies, and Cassini IV was finally forced to resign in 1793, during the height of the French Revolution. Among the other worthies in this illustrious family's tree was the elder Cassini's nephew, Giacomo Filippo Maraldi (born in 1665), who became an assistant at th e Paris Observatory. Although over- shadowed by the fame of his brilliant uncle, Maraldi was a com- petent astronomer in his own right; his work included the compi- lation of a star catalog and the calculation of cometary orbits. But he will always be best remembered for his work on Mars, which he pursued almost singlehandedly during a period when studies of the planet were generally neglected. Maraldi made a careful series of observations at every opposition beginning in 1672; his best results were obtained at the perihelic oppositions of 1704 and 1719.1 He described the markings on Mars as not no rmally well defined even in large telescopes -most of his observations were made with the 34-foot (1O.4-m) Campani tele- scope of the Paris O bservatory- and suspected th at they were vari- able not only from opposition to opposition bur even from month to month. Hi s sketches show a dusky band near the middle of th e disk, which reminded him of one of th e cloud belt s of Jupiter; it was interrupted in places and occupied only somewhat more than one hemisphere of Mar s. At one point thi s band was joined by ano ther at an ob lique angle, and taking this as a reference point, Maraldi was able to determine the rotation of the planet. Thi s poi nt seemed to return to the same location on the disk after thirty- seven days, during which the planet had rotated thirty-six tim es. He therefore worked out the rotation period at 24 hours, 4 0 min- utes , which agreed exactly with his uncle 's result. In addition to the bands just described, he made our a large triangular patch on th e Martian surface. The feature s described by Maraldi are readily iden- tified on modern maps: the band consists of the darkish swath from Mare Sirenum in the east to Mare Tyrrhenum in th e west , while the dar k triangular patch can be no thing other than Syrtis Major, th e \"H ourglass Sea.\" Nevertheless, Maraldi himself was not convinced of their permanence; he thought the y were merel y clouds. T hough the south polar spot had been sketched by Huygens in 1672, it was Maraldi who began the first thorough stu dy of th e Ma rtian pole s. He found both poles to be marked by whitish spots, though because the southern hemi sphere of Mars was tilted toward the Earth at the perihelic oppositions, the spot near the south pole was markedly easier to observe. When the polar spot was very small, Maraldi noted that it underwent a small revolution as Mars rotated, which meant that its po sition was slightl y eccentric to the pole. Moreover, there were change s in the spot's extent: in August and September 1719 it disappeared entirely, though later it returned. This behavior suggested that the material of which th e spot was made unde rwent physical changes of some kind , alth ough Maraldi himself declined to speculate on what they might be. AFTER MARALDI'S observations of 1719, little work was done on Mars for the next several decades, and of that little, none is de- serving of special notice. We pass by, therefore , the wasted perihelic oppositions of 1734, 1751, and 1766, and go directly to the contri- butions of William Herschel, one of the greatest astronomers who ever lived. Th ough his most important wo rk concerned the sidereal (30) TH E PLA N E T M AR S universe, in his early career Herschel made numerous observat ion s of the Moon and planets. Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel (who later naturalized his name to William) was born at Hanover, in Germany, in 17 38. His family was musical, and at first young Herschel attempted to follow his father intOa career as a bandsman in the Hanoverian Guard. In the sp ring of 1757, however, after the Guard's disastrous campaign against the French during the Seven Years' War (Herschel himself came under fire at the Battle of Hastenbeck), he decided to leave the Guard and seek his fortune in England. England and Hanover had en- joyed close ties ever since 1714 , when a H anoverian prince, George Louis, ascended the throne of England as George 1. Man y Germans followed the Georges to the court of London , and Herschel was drawn like a magnet. He struggled at first, but by 1766 had estab- lished himself as a musician in th e dazzling resort city of Bath -he was the org anist fo r the Octagon Chapel, and also composed mus ic and gave pri vate lessons. Though for the next ten years he made his living as a bu sy mu sician, his interests turned increasingly to astron- omy, and before long he began to cast abo ut for a suitable telescope. Th e refracto r, as we have seen, had reached an apparent dead end with the aerial telescopes of Huygens and Cassini. Isaac Newton, the architect of the theory of gravitation, was among those who concluded th at the pro blems were insurmountable, and he pro- posed that a curved mirro r be used in place of the lens to collect the light. In th e Newtonian reflector-so-called to distinguish it from the many other variations on the basic idea -the mirror re- flects the light back up the tube to a small, flat mirror, which is set at a 45 Â° angle so as to redirect the beam through a hole in the side of the tube, where the image Can be magnified by an eyepiece. Pro- vided the curve given to the main mirror is a parabola, all the light is brought to a single focu s; and since the light never has to pass through a lens until it reaches th e eyepiece, chromatic aberration Can be avoided . Newton himself actually produced a reflector with a r-inch (z. v-cm) mirror made of bell metal, which he presented to the Royal Society of London in 1672. Unfortunately, the me tals used in the mirrors of the day were difficult to figure and bring to a goo d polish, and it was not until 1722 that John Hadley was able to produce a reflector capable of equaling the performance of Huy- gens's aerial telescopes. \"A Situation Similar to Ours\" ( 31) In 1773,when Herschel began to take a serious intere st in astron- omy, he first directed his attention to refracto rs, but he found th e long tubes almost imp ossible to manage. He next rented a small reflector and, finding it satisfactory, atte mp ted to purchase such an instrument. Unfortunately, those available were beyond his means, and he decided to experiment with mir ror making. By th is time his sister Caroline and brother Alexander had come over from Han- over and joined him in Bath, and every room in the house in which they were then living soon took on the appearance of a workshop . After a number of failures at mirror making, Herschel finally, in 1774, succeeded in making a small reflector with which he recorded his first observation, of the Ori on nebul a. H e went on to produce larger and larger instruments that were far superior to any others of his day. In 1777, he moved to 19 New King Street near th e cen- ter of Bath, bringing with him working reflectors of 7-foot (2.I-m ) and o-foot (2.7-m) focal lengths. From the long, south-facing gar- den in back of the house he made a few observatio ns of Mars at its opposition that year - in particular, he recorded the \"two remark- able bright spots on Mars\" (the polar caps). HERSCHEL RETURNED to Mars in 1779, and again in 1781. O n the most fateful night of his career -Ma rch 13, I78I-he observed Mars with a recently completed zo-foot (6.I-m) reflector and re- corded in his notebook that there was a \"very lucid spot on th e sout hern limb . .. of a considerable extent.\" It was on that same night, between ro:oo and rr:oo P.M., he had discovered with his 7-foot telescope a tiny disk among the stars. At first he thought it was a comet, but the disk later proved to be someth ing much more consequential: it was nothing less than a new planet, the first dis- covered in modern times . This discovery changed Herschel's life. He was granted a pen sion by George III that allowed him henceforth to spend all of his tim e on astronomy. In gratitude, Herschel proposed to call the planet Georgium Sidus, the Star of George, but the name never stuck . On the Continent (and eventually, after Herschel's death, in England also) it was superseded by the name Uranus, which had been pro- po sed by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode. In the months after his great discovery, Herschel's attention was not entirel y absorbed in observing the new planet. He did return ( 32) THE P LAN E T M AR S to Mars from time to time as it came to a perihelic opposition on July 27,1781, and from his observations worked out a new rotation tod: 24 hours 39 minutes, 21.67 seconds, which is exactly 2 min -pen Â· , utes too long. He was also able to confirm that the north polar spot, which he observed carefully during the months of June and July, was eccentri c to the pole -the same result that Maraldi had earlier established for th e south polar spot? Before the next opposition of Mars, in 1783,William and Caro- line moved from Bath to Datchet, near Windsor. There William rented a dilapid ated old house not far from the Thames. It was large and commanded an excellent view of the sky, and it was reason - ably close to Windsor Castle in case the royal family should want to look through his telescope s. There William worked incessantly, as his sister later recalled: The assiduity with which the measurements on the diameter of the Georgium Sidus, and observations of other planets, double stars, etc., etc. , were made, was incredible, as may be seen by the various papers that were given to the Ro yal Society in 1783, which pape rs were written in the day-time , or when cloudy nights interfered. Besides this , the twelve-inch speculum was perfected before spring, and man y hours were spent at the turn- ing bench, as no t a night clear enough for observing ever passed but that some improvements were planned for perfecting the mounting and motions of the various instruments then in use, or some trials were made of new constructed eye-pieces, which were mo stly executed by my brother's own hands.' In September and October 1783, Hersc hel observed Mar s exten- sively-the planet came to a very good almost-perihelic opposition on October I- and noted that the south polar cap was very small. On Octob er I, he jotted in his notebook: \"I am inclined to think that the white spot has some little revolution. . .. It is rather prob- able that the real po le, though within the spot, may lie near the circumference of it, or one-third of its diameter from one of the sides. A few days more will show it, as I shall now fix my particular attention on it ,\" :' Later that night he established that the spot had \"a little motion, for it is now come farther onto the disk:' 5 Over the next several nights he carefully measured its position from hour to hour. Later, he used these observations to calculate that the south \"A Situation Similar to Ours\" ( 33) pol ar cap was 8.8Â° from the south pole. Thi s was not unexpected; on Earth, the pole of greatest cold does not correspond with th e geographical pole. He was also able to work out th e inclinatio n of the planet's axis to the plane of its orbit -s-z.S? 42'- and fixed th e equinoctial point on th e Martian eclipti c (th e verna l equinox of Mars ) at 19Â° 28', in Sagittarius. As the planet's axial inclination was very nearly the same as th at of Earth, Herschel realized that th e Martian seasons must be analogous to ours, though nearly twice as long. From thi s, he thought he could \"account, in a manner whi ch I think highl y probable, for the remarkable appearances about its polar regions\" : The analogy between Mars and the earth is, perhaps, by far the greatest in the whole solar system. The diurnal motion is nearly th e same; the obliquity of thei r respective ecliptics, on which the seasons depend, no t very different; of all the superior planets th e distance of Mars from the sun is by far the nearest alike to th at of the earth: nor will the length of the martial year appear very dif- ferent from that which we enjoy, when compared to the sur pris- ing duration of the years of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus. If, then, we find that the globe we inhabit has its pola r re- gions frozen and covered with mountains of ice and snow, that only partly melt when alternately exposed to the sun, I may well be permitted to surmise that the same causes may probably have the same effect on the globe of M ars; that the bright polar spots are owing to the vivid reflection of light from frozen regions; and that the reduction of those spots is to be ascribed to their being exposed to the sun,\" Herschel calculated the diameter of Mars to be 0.55 times th at of the Earth, and he found its figure to be just as flattened as th at of Jupiter-the ratio of th e equatorial to the polar diameter he put at 16/15. The dark markings on the planet came onl y incidentally within the course of Herschel's survey, and he made little more than crude sketches of them . Even so, the y are far more clearly delineated in his drawings than they are in those of his predecessors. With H erschel 's work, Mars studies left th e Maraldi era behind and entered a new epoch. T he dra wings of 1783 are of special interest. One easily recog- nizes many Martian feature s: the Hourglass Sea is clearly shown, as (34) THE P LANET MARS th \"eatures that later became known as Sinus Sabaeus and Sinus a~ e l' .

Fo r I he showed a prominent feature th at is no longer present- examp e, . . . . lar patch somewhat similar to Syrt ls M ajor, which curves a tn angu , f m M are Cimmerium to end almost in the form of a hook . down ro In addition to the se studies of th e surface, Herschel made a few observations with a bearing on th e qu estion of whether Mars had an atmos phere . Cassini, in 1672, had observed a fifth-magnitude star (Phi Aquarii) disappear a full six minutes from the disk of Mars, which led him to conclude that the planet must have a very dense atmosphere. Herschel suspecte d that rather than being hidden by the planet's atmosphere, the star had merely disapp eared int o the glare around Mars, and eventually he was able to put the question to a test. Using his zo-foot (6.I-m) reflector, which had a mir- ror 18.7 inches (47 cm) in diameter, he followed two faint stars as they approached Mars without noting the least diminution of their light . Thi s proved that the Martian atmosphere could not be as ap- preciable as Cassini had supposed . Nevertheless, Herschel did have evidence th at an atmosphere existed. \"Besides the permanent spots on its surface:' he wrote, \"I have often noticed occasional changes of partial bright belts .. . and also once a darkish one, in a pretty high latitude. . . . And these alterations we can hardly ascribe to any other cause than the variable dispo sition of clouds and vapour s floating in th e atmosphere of that planet.\" Thus he concluded that the inhabitants of Mars \"probably enjoy a situation in man y re- spects similar to ours?'? AFTE R TH E 1783 opposition of Mars , Herschel began to wr estle with the momentous questions of th e sidereal uni verse and the construction of the heavens, and henceforth paid scant attention to Mars. Nevertheless, his success inspired others- and none more than Joh ann Hieronymus Schroeter, wh o became one of the mo st enth usiastic amateur astronomers of all time and the next impor- tant observer of Mars. Although interested in ast ronomy from an early age, Schroeter followed the family profession of law. H e graduated from the U ni- versiry of G6ttingen, which had been founded by George II, and in \"A Situation Similarto Ours\" ( 35 ) 1777 was appointed secretar y of the Royal Chamber (of George III ) in Hanover. Music was ano ther of his many interests, and thi s brought him into contact with two of William H erschel 's younger bro thers, Johann Alexander and Dietrich, through whom his inter- est in astronomy was reawakened. Dietrich helped him to obtain a sm all telesco pe in 1779, and Schroeter used it to make a few ob- servations of the Moon and Venus . However, the decisive event of his life took place in 1781, with William Herschel's disco very of U ranus . In a spirit of emul ation, Schroeter resolve d to dedic ate himself henceforth to astronomy and resigned his position in H an- over in order to take on the less demanding post of chief magi strate of Lilienthal, a village on the moor near Bremen. He took up resi- dence in the Amthaus there in 1782. Meanwhile, he had succeed ed in o btaini ng two mirrors, 4.75 and 6.5 inches (12 and 16.5 cm ) in diameter, th at had been made by William Herschel himself. Th e larger of the two Schroeter assembled into a 7-foot (2.I-m) reflec- tor that was in every respect identical with th e one H erschel had used to discover Uranus; when Schroeter began to use it, in 1786, it was the largest telescope in Germany. Unlike H erschel, who was mainly concerne d with stellar and nebular astronomy, Schroeter's lifelon g interest centered almost en- tirely on the Moon and the planets . He was a compuls ive acquirer of telescopes- by 1793, he had erected several in th e garden of the Amthaus, of which the largest had a rc .z s-inch (49-cm) mirro r and a focal length of 27 feet (8.2 m ). He was also a tireless observer, and he published, at his own expense, a succession of large tom es de- scribing his obs erva tions . O ne concerned with his lunar wo rk th e, Selenotopographische Fragmente) appea red in 1791, followed by a sec- ond volume in 1802. There were similar volumes devoted to each of th e planets.\" As might be expected, Mars came in for its share of atte ntion. Schroeter's first observations of it wer e made with th e smaller of the two Herschel telescopes in November 1785. He noticed only a \"few grey, misty, poorly bounded patches,\"? As he followed these patches from night to night, he th ought they often appeared to be similar, but he could never quite convince himself that th ey were identical. At the next op posi tion, in 1787, he was able to use the larger of his He rschel telescopes on M ars for the first tim e, and his ( 36 ) THE P LAN E T MAR S . tons about th e instability of the Martian surface hardened intosusplCI an idlefixe. \"T he spots and streaks on the globe of Mars are always h ing,\" he wrote \"even from hour to hour.

The regIon IS the same one Huygens had figured so well in 1659, so there ought to have been no que stion whatever of the permanence of the markings in this of all region s-S chroeter's failure to recognize it only testifies to the difficulty of perceiving an unfamiliar object correctly and the strong influen ce of fixed ideas. Indeed, some of his later drawings actually show the M artian markin gs in the fo rm of dark belts similar to those of Iupiter, The delusion that th e patches on Mars were mere cloud forms pervaded all of Schroeter's work, and though he made careful observations at all the later oppositions-e-especially the ex- cellent perihelic opposition of August 30, 1798-he never doubted that what he was seeing was a me re floating shell of clouds.11 Schroeter also carried out careful observations of the polar caps, which he considered to be the result of a \"dazzling atmospheric pre - cipitation.\" 12 His measures of the diameter of the planet were very close to those of H erschel , th ough he determined that th e equato- rial and polar diameters agreed to within 1/81 (in this he was more nearly correct than Herschel; the polar and equatorial diame ters are now known to agree to within 1/500). H e confirme d Herschel's re- sults as to the obliquity of the axis and th e nature of the Martian seasons, and concluded th at of all the planets, Mars was the most similar to Earth .\" Schroeter's later days were sad ones. H e lived in th e turbulen t era of the Napoleonic Wars, and the peaceful \" Vale of Lilies\" was engulfed in 1806 when it came under the con trol of the French . Henceforth Schroeter was cut off from the financial sup port he had enjoyed from George III, and th e French did not pay him for his work as magi strate, which included collecting taxes for them. H e Was soon so straitened tha t he found it difficult to keep up the o b- servatory, and his situation became even worse in 1810when he was dismissed from his posi tio n. By Napoleon's decree, Lilienthal be - \"A Situation Similar to Ours\" (37) came part of the Department de Ie Bouche de Weser, which had Bremen as its capital. N evert heless, Schroeter carried on as best he could, and he was able to observe th e Gr eat Co met of 1811. The wo rst was yet to come. In April 1813, as the French were reeling back from their disast rous winte r cam paign in Ru ssia, a skir- mish to ok place near Lilienthal between a French det achment and a small band of Russian Cossacks. A French officer was wo un ded and reported th at his detachment had been fired up on by th e local peas- antry. W ithout further notice, th e French gen eral, Vandamme , gave orders to set fire to Lilienthal. A strong wind fanned the conflagra- tion, which destroyed the government buildings where Schroeter kept many of his books and manuscripts. Schroeter himself was \"o bliged to fly with my family, in o ur night dre sses, to my farm at Adolphsdorf.\" His observatory escaped the inferno but was bro ken into and plundered by French troop s several days later. They \"with a fury the most unprovoked and irrational des troyed or carri ed off the most valuable clocks, telescopes, and other astronomical instru- merits ,\"> Soon afterward the French were expelled from Germany, and Schroeter, reinstated as chief magi strate, attempted with all th e strength left in him to rebuild Lilienthal. But it was too late fo r him to tr y to rebuild his observatory. He kept despair at bay by writ ing up his observations of the Great Comet of 18Il, and then tu rn ed to his ob servations of Mars, which had never been published. M i- raculo usly, m ost of those records had escaped the fire, though a few of the drawings were damaged and had to be redrafted. Schroeter's engraver, Ti schbein of Bremen, began to make copper plates of th e drawings, but Schroeter's eyesight was failing, and the project was still unfini shed when he died in August 1816. For some reason his heirs declined to carry it through to completion.IS Thereafter, Schroeter's manuscripts and drawings of M ars re- mained unknown un til 1873, when Francois Terby, an enthusiastic I student of the red planet who had a private observatory at Louvain, Belgium, and was diligently collecting drawings of Mars for his monograph Ariographie (1875),16 succeeded in tracking them do wn among the effects of one of Schroeter's nephews. Terby later de- po sited the material in the library of the University of Leyden, and Henricus Gerardus van de Sande Bakhuyzen, director of the Ley- ( 38) T H E P LAN E T M AR S den Observato ry, finally edited Schroeter's work on Mars and pub - r hed it in 1881. Although the work appeared too late to have any ISa! ' fI ence Schroeter's drawings nevertheless remain valuable- rc m u , . d Bakhuyzen remarked, their worth is actu ally increased mdee , as of Schroeter's erroneous view that th e spots on Mars \"because . cloud-fo rms which sometimes changed very swiftly, For were mere , h Schroeter ob served these spots, he was not predisposed to see w en e details but his different representati ons of them are as fully the sam ' . . \" 17 free of prejudice and independent of one another as po ssible, It remains sur prising that Schroeter failed to recognize that th e features he saw on the surface were the same . Many of his dra wings show Syrtis Major, and other major features are also easily recog- nized; for instance, he made a vivid record of the round feature th at later became known as Solis Lacus . The most interesting drawings are th ose th at record the now-vanished curved hook, which, as men- tioned earlier, H erschel first depicted in 1783 , a marking Bakhuyzen referred to as \"Spitze B\" and Joseph Ashbrook called the ''Arrow- head\" (fig. 3). Located at about longitude 240 0 w, it extended from Mare Cimmerium into the region known on later maps as Aethio- pis and was one of the most visible features on Mars during the last two decades of th e eighteenth century, rivaling, and sometimes even mistaken for, Syrtis Major itself. Subsequently the hook dis- appeared, in wha t Ashbrook called \"the most st riking change yet recorded on the surface of the red planet.\" 18 The fact that its history is known at all is largely owing to the ast ronomer of Lilienthal and his candid records. Befor e closing the chapter on Schroeter, there is one final fact to consider. We now know that from time to time much of the surface of Mars is obscured by dust sto rms, of which I will have much to say later. Wi th his keen eye, large instruments, and long-sustained observations, Schroeter would have been in an ideal position to record dust storms had any occurred during the period of his watch. I have gon e to the trouble of calculating th e longitude of the cen- tral meridian for each of Schroeter's 231 dr awings of Mars, and have conclud ed tha t there is no clear evidence of dust storm activity-a negative result which is itself of value, since it seems to indicate that there Were no planet-encircling or global storms during the period covered by Schroeter's observations. \"A Situatio n Similar to Ours\" ( 39 ) WITH THE work of Herschel and Schroeter, the first phase of the physical stu dy of Mars was under way. Its rotation period, axial in- clination , seasons, polar caps, and atmos phere were now reason ably well known , and a tentative sta rt had been made on the Martian geography. W hether the markings we re permanent, as Herschel be- lieved, or cloud formations, as supposed by M araldi and Schroeter, remained the first order of business to be settl ed by the observers of the new century. But regardless of the outcome of those further investigations, the planet had acqui red the distinction of being by all odds the mos t Earthlike, and thus had gained immeasurably in interest over th e days when Fontenelle was able to dismiss it in a few lines. \"A Situatio n Similar to Ours\" ( 41) Areographers Mars is by no means an easy object to study. It is a small world, only slightly more than half the diameter of the Earth, and even at its nearest it never approaches closer than 140 times th e dis- tance of the Moon. Moreover, th e features on its surface are of low contrast, and thus are difficult to delineate accurately. To study M ars properly, perfect instruments and a steady atmosphere on Earth are required. The large reflectors used by Herschel and Schroeter showed con- siderable detail and allowed the first reasonably thorough study of the planet's polar caps, axial inclination, and seasons . These instru - ments were far from ideal, ho wever; the mirrors, which we re made of speculum metal -an alloy of copper and tin-we re difficult to figure accurately, and they tarnished easily. (It was onl y in th e late nineteenth century that the more satisfacto ry method of silver coat- ing glass mirrors was introduced.) Meanwhile, the refractor had begun to make a comeback. In 1729, an Englishman named Chester Moor Hall showed that N ew- ton had been premature in considering the problem of the refracto r insoluble.' Hall showed that when a concave lens of flint glass was combined with a convex lens of crown glass, the chromatic aberra- tion produced by one lens could be made to nearl y cancel that of the other for a certain band of wavelengths; say, the yellow and gr een spectral region to which the human eye is most sensitive. He had discovered the secret of the achro matic lens, but he himself did no t pursue it further, and the importance of his discovery was not fully I Â· ed by other opticians. It was not until after 1750 that another rea IZ IÂ· hman John D ollond, went into bu sin ess with his son PeterEng IS , ake achromatic lenses on a commercial basis. tom A ood refractor with a z.y-inch (64-mm ) o bjective lens could hgave a length of 20 inches (51 em) instead of 20 feet (6.1 m ), now . the days of the aerial telescop es. Obviously, thi s was a tre- as 10 mendous improvement; but even so, the early instrume nts of th e type were far from perfect. Their components were .not co rrectly matched, and bright objects seen th rough th em continued to have a troublesome amount of unfocused light (secondary spectru m ), so that the y were surrounded by gre en and w ine -colo red fringe s. Later, in order to correct for the secondary spectrum, Peter D ol- lan d began adding yet a third component to his lenses. One of the se triplet lenses with a 3.75-inch (9s-mm) aperture was purchased by Neville Maskelyne for the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and another, of 3.8 inches (97 mm), was acquired by the wealthy con- noisseur Dr. William Kitchener, who commented that \"it shews the disc of th e Moon and of Jupiter as white and as free from colour as a Reflector,\" ? But progress in this direction was limited. Lenses larger th an about 4 inches (IO cm ) in diameter proved to be almost impossible to make because the flint disks always developed streaks and veins during casting. S CHR O E T E R MADE few obser vations of M ars after 1800. Instead, the most diligent observer of the period was a Frenchman, Honore Flaugergues, who is best remembered today as the discoverer of the Great Comet of 18n. H e had a pri vate o bservato ry at Viv iers (Ardeche), in southeastern France, whos e m ain instrument was a rather inefficient achromat of 44-foot (13-4-m ) focal length, giving a usual magnification of only 90 X. Flau gergues began ob ser ving Mars at th e opposition of 1796, but carried out especially thorough studies at th e oppositions of 1809 and 1813, the latter being the first perihelic opposition of the new century. He noted the more promi- nent patches on the disk, which app eared dark reddish to him, and calculated th e times at which the plan et's rotation ought to br ing the same aspects into view again. H e found great inconsistencies, however, and was unable to believe that he was actu ally observ- ing th e solid surface of the planet. In stead, he accepted Schroeter's conclusion that only atmospheric features were on view. \"T hese Areographers ( 4 3 ) patches seemed to me to be in gen eral confused and badly defined,\" he wrote in 1809, \"to an extent that it was difficult to distinguish exactly their outlines and their full extent. I can say only th at nor. mally the south part of th e disk was th e region of Mars which Con- tained th e princi pal patches.\" 3 As noted earlier, we now know that Mars is sometimes obscured by dus t clouds and veils, and some his- to rians claim that Flaugergues was th e first to record th em .' H ere I must disagree; Flaugergues simpl y wasn't a good enough ob server, and his telescope was too sm all and to o crude to have produced trustworthy results. It is clear that for all his diligence, he achieved no significant advance ove r Schroeter or even M arald i. In add ition to his rather confused observatio ns of the Spots on Ma rs, Flaugergues noticed the rapidity of th e south polar cap's melting and remarked that if it consisted of ice and snow, \"as every- one believes,\" thi s proved that Mars, despite its greater distance from the Sun, mu st be warmer than the Earth! MEANWHIL E, important developments had been taking place in optics. In 1799, a Swiss art isan named Pierre Louis Guinand had discovered that flawless disks as large as 6 inch es (15 em) in diameter could be cast from flint glass if the flint was stirred while it was cool - ing . Guinand moved to Munich in 1805, and there he joined forces with a brilliant young optician, Joseph Fr aunhofer, who under Guinand's supervision became extremely proficient in glassm aking. Moreover, Fraunhofer practically devised the science of correctly designing achromatic objective lenses using onl y two components. By 1812 he had succeeded in producing a fine achromat 7.5 inches (19 em) in diameter. Fraunhofer's refractors produced clear, brilliant images of the Moon and planets, and were a ma rked improvement over the large reflectors used by Herschel and Schroeter. By 1813, the year Schroeter's ob servatory at Lilienthal was destroyed by the Fren ch, the refract or was once more coming to dominate astron- omy-indeed, the nineteenth century would become the \"century of the refracto r.\" Among the first to use a Fraunhofer refract or to view Mars was Georg Karl Friedrich Kun ow sky. He was a lawyer by profession, and served as Iustizrat in Berlin , but Kunowsky was also a keen amateur astronomer. With a 4.5-inch (rr-cm) Fraunhofer refracto r, he made a number of sketches of the dark patches at the unfavorable ( 4 4 ) T H E P L A N E T MA RS sl'tion of 1821-22. 5 U nlike Schroeter and Flaugerg ues, how- opp oKUllowsky came to the conclusio n that th e patches were fixed ever, S of the surface.

T hat bemg the case, It IS easySyrtIS 1 to unde rstwd wh y no one had seen any point in attempting to draw a map of the planet. A LL OF THIS would change with the advent of Wilhelm Beer wd Johann Heinrich M adler, who began the next new era in the study of Mars-a period Flammarion described as the \"geographi- cal period.\" Thus far the study of Mars had advanced by slow and uncertain step s; after Beer and M adler many uncertainties re- mained, but henceforth th e results rested on a firme r basis. Flam- marion , in his incomparable fashion , said it best : \"Christopher Columbus was happy when he was halted by th e Am erican con - tinent du ring his voyage of circumnavigation beyond Asia. M ars does not have its Christopher Columbus. He achieved fame by the single fact of touching America; a phalanx of astronomers has been busy for more than a century studying their celestial continent. But Beer and M adler deserve to be remembered as the true pioneers in this new conquest,\" ? Madler was born in Berlin in 1794, the son of a master tailor ? He had taught him self to read by the time he was four, and a maternal un cle, Paul Strobach, recognizing his abilit y, pushed for him to get a sound education. At age twelve he was sent to the Friedrich-Werdersche Gymnasium in Berlin. Meanwhile his inter- est in astronomy had surfaced, inspired by the comet Flaugergues had discovered- the Great Comet of181!. Madler proved to be an excellent scho lar and seemed destined for an academic career, but then disaster struck - when he was nineteen, an outbreak of typhus claimed both his parents and his maternal uncle , and he found him- self weighted with the responsibility of supp orting four younger siblings. H e abandoned his academic dreams and enrolled in the tuition-free Kiisterschen Seminary in order to stu dy to become an elementary school teacher. At the same time he began giving les- sons as a private tutor, and in 1819 he founded a school in Berlin for children of parents w ith limited means-ob viously not a highly lucrative way to make a living. Meanwhile, he began attending lee- Areographers ( 4 5 ) tures at the Uni versity of Berlin and heard, among others, P. G. L. Dirich let on higher mathematics and Johann Elert Bode and Johann Franz Encke on astronomy. A turning point in his life came in 1824, when he met W ilhelm Beer, who had applied to him for private lessons in higher mathe- matics and astronomy. Beer, a well-to-do banker wh o had JUSt taken over the family banking business from his father, Jakob Herz Beer, was then twenty-seven years old. His brothers were th e poet Michael Beer and the composer Jakob Beer, who styled himself Meyerbeer and went on to become the mo st successful op eratic composer of his day. After he met Madler, Beer decided to set up his own observatory. The main instrument was a 3.7s-inch (9s-mm ) Fraunhofer refractor, which was mounted equatorially and equipped with a clock drive allowing it to follow the apparent drift of the stars. Beer set it up near his villa, on a platfo rm in the famous Tiergarten under a rotat- able dome 12 feet in diame ter whose shu tte rs opened upon a swath of sky 20Â° wide. The telescope was in place by 1828, and two years later Beer and Madler began to use it for mapping the Moon, the work for which they are best remembered. (It has long been recog- nized th at most of th e actua l mapping was don e by Madler; Beer's main contribution was in allowing him to use the observatoryl) They had been mappi ng the Moon for several months when Mars's perihelic opposition on September 19, 1830,presented them with a great op po rtunity. For several weeks aro und this date, Beer and Madler observed Ma rs extensively. Their first goal was to pre- cisely determine its ro tation period, and at the same time they hoped to estab lish once and for all whether or no t the patches on the surface of Mars were variable,\" Beer's 3.7S-inch Fraunhofer refractor, th ough of modest size, was first class and gave a sharper definition than the larger reflectors of Herschel and Schroeter. Even so, Beer and Madler found the Mar- tian surface featu res to be weak and ill-defined - which explains how th e sharp disagreement as to their natu re and permane nce could have gone on for so long. They wrote that the use of a micrometer did not seem convenient to us, th e thick- ness of th e threads causing more unce rtainty in measurement of such fine objects th an was produced by estimating by the eye ( 4 6) THE PLANET MARS Th drawings were executed immediately at th e telescope . alon~.

It 10 179, u lay only 8Â° south of th e equator, and they reg~rded i~ as a conve - nient reference point for determ ining the rotation penod of Mars . Later astron om ers concurred in the aptness of their choice-e ver since Beer and Madler, th at feature has defined the zero meridian of Mars and Camille Flammarion later named it the Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani). Rather th an giving names to the various mark- ings they mapped, Beer and Madler simply designated them with letters-thus the small round patch was indicated by the letter a) Syrtis Major by efh)and so on . From their observations of the patch a) they put the rotation period at 24 hours, 37 minutes, 9.9 seconds . In 1830, Beer and Madler began a careful study of the south polar cap.They followed its rapid shrinking and noted that thi s continued until the Martian season corre sponding to our mid-July. Then the cap began slowly to increase again . These observations lent strong suppOrt to th e idea that it consisted of ice and snow. Although Beer and Madler were able to confirm some of their earlier results at the oppositions of 1832 and 1834-3S, they added little that was new. In 1837 they began to use a much larger in- Strument, the o.o-inch (24-cm) refractor of the Ro yal Observatory of Berlin. Despite this superior instrument, however , they were Areographers ( 4 7 ) much hampered by Mars's greater distance from the Earth and the \"almost unprece~ented bad weather\" in Berlin. Neverth eless, they were able to achieve some useful results. They revised the rotation period to 24 hou rs, 37 minutes, 23 .7 seconds -ve ry close to the presently accepted value. This was, they noted, 2 minutes shOrter than the period published by William Hersc hel, but they were able to account for the discrepancy after carefully reviewing Herschel's records from 177 7 and 1779. During the inte rval Herschel had used to compute the rotation period, Mars had completed one more rotation than he had realized. W hen this was factored in, the agree- ment with thei r own results was excellent . In 1830, the rapidly shrinking south polar cap had been tilted toward the Earth; in 1837, it was the north polar cap. The two caps showed markedly different behavior; both were centered within a few degrees of the poles, but the south polar cap grew much larger. At the same time, its retreat was more rapid and comple te; the smallest size Beer and Madler recorded for the south pola r cap was 6 0, whereas the north polar cap never shrank below 12Â° or 14 0. There are perfectly logical reasons for these differences, and they have to do with the nature of the Martian seasons. To make this clear, it is useful to introduce a calendar based on L., the areocen- tric longitude of the Sun, which gives Mars's position in its orbit relative to the Sun -Mars line at the northern spring equinox, which marks the beginning of northern spring. This point is defined as L, = Â°0. The northern spring lasts from L, = 0Â° to 90 0 , sum mer from 90 Â° to 180 Â°, fall from 180 Â° to 270 Â°, and winter from 270 Â° to 360 Â° (or 0 Â° ). (As on Earth, seasons in the Martian southern hemi- sphere are 180 Â° out of phase with those of the northern hemisphere, so that the southern hemisphere has its summer when the north- ern hemisphere has its winter, and vice versa.) Since Mars's year is almost twice as long as one Earth year- it lasts for 668.6 Martian days, or Sols (I Sol = 24 hours, 37 minutes, 22.663 seconds) - it fol- lows that Martian seasons will be much longer than those of Earth. They are also more unequal- a consequence of the much greater eccentricity of the Martian orbit . Th e details are given in table 1. Since Mar s's perihelion lies at L, = 250.8 7 Â°, the planet passes this po int late in th e southern hemisphere spring. Mars is then 26 mil- lion miles (43 million km) nearer to the Sun and receives 45 percent more solar radiation, than at aphelion (L, = 70 .87Â°) . Thus sou th- ( 4 8) TH E P L A N E T MAR S E 1 Duratio n of Martian Seasons Relative to T hose of Earth 1'j\\BL .-- Martian season Duration on Areographic Northern Southern M ars Earth longitude hemi sphere hemi sphe re (Sols) (days) (days) (L,)- 0_90Â° spring fall 194 199 92.9 90-180Â° sum mer winter 178 183 93.6 180-2 70Â° fall spring 143 147 89.7 270- 0Â° winter summer 154 158 89.1 -;:rce: c.

Conversely, the southern hemi- sphere autumns and winters, which occur near aphelion, are much colder and long er. Th e southern hemisphere is thus a place of ex- tremes; the northern hemisphere is one of relative moderation. The behavior of the polar caps reflects these idiosyncrasies. The south polar cap grows greatly during the southern hemisphere's long, cold winte r and shrinks rapidl y during the short, hot summer. The north cap, reflecting that hemisphere's more moderate seasons, does not vary between such wide extremes. There are composi- tional differences as well, about which I will have more to say later. The northern cap is mainly made up of water ice, the southern cap of frozen carbo n dioxide. In addition to their studies of the polar caps, Beer and Madler cominued to sketch the dark patch es on the planet. The dark area surrounding the north polar cap seemed to undergo especially marked changes- in 1837 it was of unequal width and not every- where equally black, though it was still noticeably darker than the other Spots; by 1839 it had become faint and narrow. These change s would be explained, they suggested, if the dark area was marshy soil moistened by meltwater from the retreating snow. There were tim .es In 1837 when Mars was nearly featureless apart from the polar patch, which always remained distinctl y in view. Indeed, even the patch efh (Syrtis Major ) was by no means well defined . Despite the Areographers ( 49) unste~diness of the atmosphere at Berlin that year, it is tem pting to believe that so me of the obscurations may have been genuine! Martian -caused by the dust clouds and veils that are known to de- velop from time to time. In 1840, Madler combined all the observations and drew th e first map of Mars ever made. Admittedly, it leaves much to be d esired but it nevertheless represents a tremendous step forward. That sam~ year, Madler left Berlin to become director of the Dorpat Observa_ to ry in Estonia, and at the opposition of 1841 he made only a few observations with the o.o-inch (za -cm) Dorpat refractor. The ex- perience of 1837 was repeated; though he wa s able to recove r some of the spots of earlier years, he lo oked in vain for others, including th e prominent round pa tch a. He was no longer so certain of the long-term stability of the markings. B EER AND MADLER tower so far above th eir contempo raries that there is a distinct danger of forgetti ng th e o ther observers who were active at th at time. There was W illiam Herschel's son John, for exam ple, a great astronomer in his own right. H e considered the ocher areas of Mars to be continents and suggested that they might be similar to the red limestones of Earth; th e dark areas he reg arded as seas since, he noted, wa ter absorbs light mo re strongly than land. H e also reco rded green ish tints in th e seas, though these he sus- pected of be ing illusory-a mere optical effect resu lting from con- tr ast with th e ocher areas. As we shall see, th e colors of Mars woul d become one of the most debated features of the planet. Ano ther leading astronomer of the period was Francois Arago, who in 1830 became di rector of th e Paris Observato ry. He too remarked on the colors of the planet , finding a rosy tint o bvious at low powers; with larger instruments, however, this passed successively to o range, yel- low, and finally to lemon.'! He agreed with the younger Herschel th at the greenish tint of the dark areas wa s a contrast effect . The next perihelic opposition took place on August 18, 1845, and it is memorable for the discovery by Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel, of the Cincinnati O bservato ry, of th e large detached area of the south polar cap (centered at 75Â° S, 320 Â° w) that begins to sep arate from the cap's rim at about the same Martian seasonal date each year (L, about 240 Â° ). The final remnants do not disappear for another twenty or thi rty days. This feature is still sometimes referred to as ( 50 ) THE P L A N E T MA R S \"Mountains of Mitchel;' but the name is a misnomer-in stead web . g mountainous, the region is actually depressed relati ve to of em . rr oun di ng terr ain. the su As B ET TER telescopes became more widely available, and more d more people acquired the passion to observe, th e number of an tl.ons of Mars increased. The improvement in the quality of observa .. . . . s in th e thirty )'ears after Beer and Madler did their work drawmg is dramatic. In 1856, for example, the English amateur astronomer and ioneer photographer Warren De la Rue made several excellent p fl . SÂ·M Â·drawings with a 13-inch (33-cm) re ector- m one, yrtis aJo r, or the Hourglass Sea, app ears very narrow; in another, the conspicu- oUS round patch described by Beer and Madler is represented as a pointed tongue. At the opposition of 1858, Mars was extensively observed by the Jesuit astronomer Angelo Secchi, directo r of the observatory of the Collegio Romano in Rome.P Secchi used a 9.5-inc h (24 -cm) equa- torial refractor with magn ifying powers of 300--400 X. In one o f his first observati ons, on May 7, 1858, he described \"a large triangu- lar patch , blue in color.\" T his was none other than the well -known Hourglass Sea, but Secchi gave it a different name : he called it the \"Atlantic Canale; ' comme nting that it \"seems to play the role of the Atlantic which, on Earth, sep arates th e O ld Continent from th e New .\" Thus th e first occur rence of the fateful term canale, which in Italian can mean either \"channel\" or \"canal.\" Secchi himself was in- consistent; later he called the same feature the \"Sco rpion\" - a not inapt compariso n to its appearance at the time. Secchi wa s im pressed with the great variety in th e tints of the Martian features and even attempted to make the first color repre- sentations of the planet in pastels . He described th e dark areas sur- rounding the polar caps as \"ashen colored;' but most of the other dark areas appeared bluish, with an occasional tint of green. As for the nature of th e M art ian markings, he wrote : It is clear th at the varia tions [in the polar caps] can be exp lained only by a melti ng of the snow or a disappearance of the clouds covering th e polar regions. These aspects also prove that liquid Water and seas exist on Mars; thi s is a natural result of the behav- ior of th e snows. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that Areographcrs (51 ) the blue markings which we see in the equatorial regions do not change sensibly in form, whereas the whi te fields in the neigh- borhood of the poles are adjacent to reddish fields which Can only be continents. Thus, the existence of seas and continents has been today conclusively proved.v ... At the perihelic opposition of July 1860, Mars was very far to the south, and thus difficult to observe from the Northern H emi- sphere of the Earth, where most observatories were located. At the next opposition, in 1862, Mars was more favorably placed, and a number of observers took advantage of the opportunity, includ- ing Secchi in Ro me, Lord Rosse in Ireland, and William Lassell on Malta. An import ant series of drawings was made by the director of the Leyden O bservato ry, Frederik Kaiser, who reworked th e rota - tion period by comparing his drawings with those made by H ooke and Huygens in the seventeenth century-his result was 24 hours, 37 minutes, 22.6 seconds.> H e also compiled the best map of the planet up to tha t time, continuing to use letters to designate the various features. Another skillful observer was J. Norman Lockyer, an Englis h astronomer destined to playa prominent role in late Vic- torian science .IS Lockyer used a 6.2s -inch (ro-crn) refractor, and his drawings of Mars, in th e estimation of E. M . Antoniadi, \"gave us the first really truthful representation of the planet.\" 16 T his English astronomer accepted the basic permanence of the dark areas, th ough he no ted that there were obvious variations over time. Thus, to give but one example, Solis Lacus -the \"Oculus,\" or Eye, as it was then known -which had been depicted as nearly circular by Beer and Madler, had become distinctly elongated by Lockyer's time. Still other variations Lockyer believed to be accounted for by clouds- indeed, his disks indicate that there were some rather persis tent veils over Mare Erythraeum in 1862. Like Secchi, he believed that the greenish areas were seas and the ruddy areas continents. This belief was by now generally accepted, though Secchi was premature, to say the least, in considering that it had been proved. A few astronomers, at any rate, remained skeptical. An Ox ford pro - fessor of geology named John Phillips, one of the most active ob- servers of Mars at the opposition of 1862, wrote that \"a great part of the northern area appeared bright, and often reddish, as [if ] it were land, while a great part of the southern area was of the grey ( 52) THE P LAN E T MAR S hich is considered to indicate water, but relieved by various ~w . f a tint more or less approaching to that of the bnghter tractS 0 . f the northern hemisphere.\" 17 Though he hedged regardmg spaces 0 h th e dark patches were actual seas or mere gray plains likewhet er f th e Moon he pointed out that if they were actual seas, the those 0 ' . . . , ular reflection ought to be VISIble on them.

Will iam Rutter Dawes, the son of a mathe- matics teacher and once an astronomer on an expedition to Botany Bay, Australia. Dawes had studied medicine as a young man and later became a clerg yman with a small Independent congregation at Ormskirk, north of Liverpool. After failing health forced him to give up his congregation, he devoted himself entirely to astron- omy. In the I840She was an assistant at the private observatory of a wealthy businessman, George Bishop, at St. John's Wood, London. After his second marriage- to an Ormskirk solicitor's widow- Dawes acquired the financial independence he needed to set up his own private observatories, first at Cranbrook, Kent, and then, from 1857 until his death in 1867, at Haddenham, Buckinghamshire. He Was an exceptional observer noted for the keenness of his sight; but eagle-eyed as he was at the telescope, he was so terribly nearsighted that he could pass his wife in the street without recognizing her! Dawes had already made some drawings of Mars in 1862 and at earlier oppositions. In 1864, he used an 8-inch (zo-cm) Cooke re- fractor, usually with a magnifying power of 2s8 x. His drawings, Areographers (53) wrote Richard Anthony Proctor, \"are far better than any others. . . . The views by Beer and Madler are good, as are some of Secchi's (though they appear badly drawn) . Nasmyth's and Phillips', D e La Rue's two views are also admirable; and Lo ckyer has given a better set of views th an any of the others. But there is an amount of de- tail in Mr. Dawes' views which rende rs th em superior to any yet taken .\" 19 Camille Flammarion concurred: \"The drawings by . . . Dawes brought a new precision to stu dies of Mars.\" 20 A case in point: what Beer and Madler had taken as a small, perfectly roun d spot (the feature the y had designated a) was seen by Warren De la Rue as pointed and by Lockyer as an elongated patch; D awes, ho wever, resolved it into a bay with two forks, whose extensions, he noted, gave the impression of \"tw o very w ide mouths of a river, which however I could never trace . . .. It may be that the sea has receded from that part of the coast, and left the tongue of land ex- posed .\" 21 This was the famous \"D awes' forked bay\"-a name that is still used from time to time. By the 1860s, Beer and Madler's chart was hopelessly out of date. Kaiser's was a definite improvement, but he had done nothing to improve on the old lettering system of nomenclature, which was proving more and more inconvenient. Over the years, a few names had come into general but unoffic ial use for the mo st prominent or singular features - Hourglass Sea and Oculus, for exampl e- but most of the features remained unnamed. The first attempt to find a more suitable Martian nomenclatu re was mad e by Proctor. He was a prolific writer of popular books on astronomy and, as we have seen, a great admirer of Da wes. In 1867, Proctor drew up a map of Mars based , somewhat crudely, on Dawes's drawings. \" He explained his system of nomenclature by saying, \"I have appli ed to the different features the names of those ob servers wh o have studied the phy sical peculiarities presented by Mars .\" For later reference , some of his nam es are here paired with th ose later proposed by Schiaparelli: proctor's no menclature has often been criticized, mainly because f his names honored English astronomers, but also be- so many 0 h sed many names more than once-in particular, Dawes cause e u appeared no fewer than six times (Dawes Ocean, Dawes Continent, Dawes Sea, Da wes Stra it, Dawes Isle, and Dawes Forked Bay). Moreover, as Schiaparelli later complained, Proctor's map did \"not even give an accura te representation of the ob servations of D awes himself.\" 23 Even so, Proctor's names are not without charm, and for all thei r shortco mings th ey were a foundation on which later astronomers could-and did-improve. T H R 0 UGH D AWE s ' s skillful work, the main outlines of the Mar- tian \"seas\" and \"continents\" - as most of the astronomers of the day assumed them to be - had been reliably depicted. Moreover, on those same dra wings on which the broader features of the Martian disk were so artfully and accurately portrayed, tentative indications of a class of finer details were now rising for the first time above the threshold of perception. From some, though not all, of the pointed extensions of the dark seas there seemed to be prolongations into thin, wispy streaks, which imperceptibl y disso lved again into the broad ocher parts of the planet. The same ocher areas, Secchi had noted, were not uniform but seemed to be filled with fine detail, whose nature \"it was impossible to depict, or even for the imagina- tion to capture.\" 24 All of this was suggestive.

New comb tri ed to gain a share of the credit for himself, impl ying in an article th at appeared in the New YOrk Tribune tw o days after th e discovery was ann ounced th at H all had not fully appreciated what he had found until he- Newcomb- had worked out th e period of revolution fro m th e pre- liminaryobservations. Mean whil e, in N ew York , H olde n and D raper were also getting into the act. On August 28, H old en ann ounced that th ey had used Draper's 28-inch (71-cm) reflector to discover a thi rd satellite, and on returning to Washington, H old en claimed to have found yet a fourth . Hall was skeptical and wrote to Arthur Searle of H arvard: \"I think it will turn out that th e Draper-Holden moon and the re- cent H olden mo on do not exist.\" ? He attempted to confirm these alleged discoveries with the Washington refractor without success, and later computations showed that Holden's mo on did not even obey Kepler's laws of motion. \"Its existence was therefore a math e- matical impossibility;' Hall wrote to Edward C. Pickering of Har- vard Observatory, adding bitterly: \"If I were to go through this experience again other people wo uld verify their own moons? \" Rumors of Holden's spurious moons would continue to circu- late in the astronomical community for years, and Holden became known as the man \"who had set all Washington astronomers laugh- ing by detecting a . . . satellite of M ars with an impossible period and distance, and remaining deceived by, it for months!\" ? But Holden, in Hall's view, at least, had behaved more admirably than Newcomb. As late as 1904 Hall was still bitter about New comb's attempt to usurp credit for the discovery of the satellites, and wrote to S. C. Chandler, [r.: \"Newcomb was greatly excited over my dis- cover y. Holden was away, and Draper made a blunder, and after- wards Holden behaved very well. N ewcomb felt disapp ointed and sore, and something is to be allowed for human nature under such circumstances . He was always greedy for money and glory.\"10 In response to a suggestion by H enry Madan of Eton, England, Hall nam ed the satellites Phobos (Fear) and Deimos (Flight), after the attendants of Mars mentioned in the fifteenth book of H omer'S Iliad: \" H e spake, and sum moned Fear and Flight to yoke his steeds.\" Hall continued to watch th e new satellites until the end of Oc tober, and his observations gave him the information he needed to work out the mass of Mars-th e amount of matter it contains-from its ( 62 ) TH E P LAN E T MAR S the moon s' motion s.

T HERE WERE other important stu dies of Mars in 1877 as well. Nath aniel Green, an amateur astronomer and professional portrait artist who at one time had given lesson s in painting to Queen Vic- toria, made a careful stu dy with his I3-inch (33-cm) Ne wtonian re- flector on the eastern Atlantic island of Madeira, a site renowned for its pellucid skies. Green drew up a map and also noted brighteni~gs at the limb and terminato r which he identified correctly as mormng and evening clouds (fig. 5),12 Another valuable set of observations was made by Englishman Henry Pratt, using an 8-inch (zr-cm) re- flector. Pratt reported that \"in moments of the finest definit ion the markings have exhibited a stippled rather than a streaked character, and glimpses were obtained of a structu re so complicated and deli- cate th at the pencil cannot reproduce it. . . . Frequently what at first sight appeared as a broad hazy streak has been, by patient watch- ing for the best moments, resolved into several separate masses of f d 1Â· ki \" 13shading enclosing lighter portions full 0 very e reate mar ngs. But by far the mo st important development of th e memorable 1877 opposition - after Hall's discovery of th e satellites, of course- Was the landm ark study of the planet begun by th e Italian astrono- mer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, who wo uld become the leading expert on the planet for the next two decades (fig. 6). Schiaparelli was born on March 14, 1835, in the town of Savi- gHano, in the Piedmont region of northwestern Ital y, not far from the French border.r' The town lies among the foo thills of the Alps 1877 (6 3) which he successfully put the wires of the micrometer (incidentally, Schiaparelli, like Dawe s, was very nearsighted; again, th is did not interfere with his wo rk at the eyepiece). Robert G. Aitken, a highly respected observer of double stars with the much larger telescope at the Lick Ob servatory, would later say of Schiaparelli's measures of the double star fJ Delphini that \"the residuals shown in Schia- parelli's measures . . . will not seem very large-in fact it is surp ris- ing that measures of such a pair could be obtained at all with so small a telescope.\" 18 In 1877, Schiaparelli began his studies of the planets. Before de- scribing what he found out about Mars, I will sum marize som e of the results he obtained on the other planets. At the time , the rota- tions of all the planets from Mercury to Ma rs were believed to be about twenty-four hours. The rotation of Mars had, of course, been established beyond dispute, and indeed was well known to with in a tenth of a second . However, Schiaparelli had little confidence in the rotations ascribed to Mercury and Venus, and he decided to in- vestigate the matter further. Venus is brilliant but difficult to observe because it usually shows only nebulous and ill-defined surface markings. In December 1877, Schiaparelli made out a pair of bright oval spots near the southern cusp of the planet, and also a shadowy streak. The markings were unusually conspicuous by Venusian standards, and he kept them under obser vation for two months, during which he failed to detect the slightest change in either their form or their po sition relative to the terminator. H e therefore concluded that Venus's rotation was very slow, between six and nine months, and probably equal to the peri od of its revolution - 224.7 Earth days.\" Thi s announce- ment received support from some quarters , and disagreement from others. Indeed, the question of Venus's rotation continued to vex visual observers right up to the early 1960s. It was finally settled only by advanced methods of radio astronomy.s? Unlike brilliant Venus, Mercu ry had received little attention from astronomers; being inn ermost to the Sun, it is notoriously difficult to observe. Schroeter, in 1800, had offered the onl y posi- tive dete rmination; he had observed exclusively in twilight periods, and he deduced from the blunted appearance of the southern cusp, which seemed to be unchanged from one night to the next , th at the period of rotation must be right around twenty-four hours. Schia- (68) T H E PLANET MA RS parelli found the twilight condition s generally unfavorable because of the planet 's low altitu de, and instead decided to tr y to observe Mercury during broad daylight, when it was higher in the sky. B e made the first tests in June 1881, and was encouraged enough to plan a regular stu dy in 1882. Tha t year he made every effort to keep the planet under continuous surveillance, observing it on February 4-10 , March 31- April 28, May 24-31, Augus t 5-21, and September 19-30. Although most of the observations were made around the times of Mercury's greatest elonga tio ns from the Sun, the planet was near superior conjunctio n in August, and Schiaparelli succeeded in following the small gibb ous disk, then only 4\" of arc across, to within 3.5 0 of the Sun . W ith his fine refractor he made out markings on the surface which, he wro te, usually appeared \"in the form of extremely faint streaks, which under the usual condi- tions of observations can be made out only with the greatest effort and atte ntion .T\" Schiaparelli's best observations were made in 1883-84. He was on the verge of making his results public then , but he decided to wait until he had had a chance to observe Mercury with the ob- servato ry's new ro-inch (49-cm) refractor, which was installed in 1886. Th ese studies added nothing substantially new. Finally, in 1889, he was ready to announce his main result : the rotation period of Mercury, he declared, is equal to that of its revolution, eighty- eight days, and thus one side of the planet is always perpetually in daylight and the other in darkness. Th ough his observations had indicated a definite slow drift of markings across the disk, he ex- plained this as an effect of librat ion, already well known in the case of the Moon, with its captured rotation with respect to the Earth. The Moon's libration is simply a result of the fact that the constant rate of the Moon's axial spin gets out of step with its changing ve- locitv in its elliptical orbit, thereby producing an apparent rocking movement to and fro. Mercury, because of its very eccentric orbit around the Sun, would be expected to have a very marked libra- tion, amounting to some 470 21 ' in longitude. But even granting Such a broad allowance for variation in the observed position of the planet's features, Schiaparelli still found discrepancies, and he remarked to the English astronomer William F. Denning that the ~arkingswere \"extremely variable.\" Sometimes they seemed to be partially Or totall y obscured.\" More over, the planet showed \"some 1877 ( 69) brilliant spots which change their position.\" T hus Schiaparelli con- clud ed that th e surface of Me rcur y was sometimes covered by \"veils [of] .. . more or less opaque condensation s produced in th e atmo- sphere of Mercur y, which fro m afar presents aspects analogous to th ose which our Earth would show from a similar distance.\"22 Other observers, including Henri Perrotin, Percival Lo well and Rene Jarry-Desloges, confirmed th e eighty -eight-day rotatio~ period. So, most notably, did the skilled Greco-French astronomer Eugene Michael Antoniadi, who between 1924 and 1929 carried out a careful stu dy of Mercury with th e 33-inch (Sj -crn) refractor at Meudon Observatory, near Paris. H e agre ed with Schiaparelli's rotation peri od , and also supported th e existence of Mercur ial clouds. Am ong the leading observers of th e planet, only th e French astronom er Georges Fournier was unabl e to reach a definite con- clusion as to the rotation of Mercury.\" In fact, Fournier's diffidence proved to be justified. T he true rotation of Mercury was discovered only in 1965 by radio astrono- mers. In stead of being equal to the period of revolution , 88 days, it is precisely two -thirds of thi s- 58.65 days. How could th e visual ob servers have been so far wrong? It turns out that 58.65 days is not onl y two-thirds of Me rcur y's peri od of revolution around the Sun, it is close to half of the period between its successive appear- ances in the same phase as viewed from the Earth (the syno dic period, which in Me rcur y's case is n6 days). Thus, when Mercury comes to its greatest elongations from the Sun and is best placed for observation, astronomers in the Northern Hemisphere tend to see the same features ; it is natural to conclude from this th at the planet always keeps the same face toward the Sun.24 The selective observatio n of the planet through periodic observing windows has been called the stro boscope effect. The synchronism is not perfect; after about seven years new regions of th e planet begin to swing into view-but by the time seven years had passed, Schiapa reIli had already made up his mind and had given up regular observing of th e planet. As for his successors, their results demonstrate onl y too clearly that once a definite expectation is established, it is inevit able that subsequent observers will see what they expect to see, refining their expectations in a continuing process until finally everyo ne sees an exact and detailed -but ultimately fictitiou s-picture. Even Antoniadi was misled; ironically, by the time he began his ( 7 0 ) TH E P L AN E T MAR S d of Mercury, the same features had returned to the disk that stud ~een present for Schiaparelli 's observations. He too kept the ha d h . . under observation for only seven years, an t us It ISnot sur- lanet p . . that (with due allowan ce made for differences in their dr aw- pnsillg . . .

I HO P E the reader will forgive me for going into the episode of Mercury's rotation at such great length. It provides, I think, an ex- cellent int roduction to the Ma rtian \"canal\" affair because it clearly illustrates what Antoniadi onc e referred to as \"the snares awaiting the observer at each stage of his work ,\"> snares from which no observer, no matter how skillful or cautious, can ever be entirely immune. These snares are nowhere better documented than in the history of the famo us, or infamous, Martian canals. We now return, there- fore, to the fall of 1877, with Mars close to the Earth. Schiaparelli was eager to test the 8.6-inch Merz refractor-which he had been using for two years to stu dy double stars- on Mars. It is clear that he did not at first intend to devote himself to a continued series of observations of the planet. Rather, he explained, I desired only to experiment to see whether our refractor . possessed th e necessary optical qualities to allow for the study of the surfaces of the planets. I desired also to verify for myself what was said in books of descriptive astronomy about the sur - face of Mars , its spots, and its atmosphere. I must confess that, on comparing the aspects of the planet with the maps th at had been most recentl y publi shed, my first attempt did not seem very encouraging?? FUrther study showed, ho wever, that his drawing s agreed quite well with the best made at previous oppositions, such as those by Kaiser and Lockyer. Th us, on Septembe r 12, 1877, he resolved on a careful study for the purpose of drawing up a new map of the planet. He gene rally used a magnifying power of 322Xon the Me rz refractor (and later, when the disk had become very small as the planet receded to a great distance from the Earth, 468x ). Meticulous 187 7 ( 71) observer that he was, he was not satisfied to rely on eye estimates of the positions of features. Instead , he based his map on micrometric measures of the longitudes and latitudes of sixty-two distinctly rec- ognizable points on the planet. Th e resulting map was a trem endous advance over anything that had appeared before. It was, Camille Flamm arion declared, \"a trul y remarkable piece of wo rk, and One showing features which the old observers of Mars could never have s~specte~. It depended for its successful completion On an un flag- gmg persIstence, an excellent eye, a rigorous method of observation and a good instrument/' ?\" Precisely for this reason, Schiaparelli found himself faced with a dilemma. At first he had intended to adhere to Proctor's nomencla- ture, which Flammarion had already adopted for his 1876 map, with a few changes; for example, Flammarion had decided to retain the older name Mer du Sablier, French for \"H ourglass Sea,\" instead of using Proctor's Kaiser Sea. On looking through his 8.6-inch Merz, however, Schiaparelli found that drastic changes were necessary; some names had to be abandoned, and many new ones had to be introduced to describe the numerous features being seen for the first time . Proctor's four main \"cont inents\" were actu ally a multitude of islands, several of his \"seas\" had disappeared or shrunk to insig- nificance (Main Sea, Dawes Sea), while still others had opened up. \"In order to avoid misunderstandings and mistakes;' Schiaparelli wrote, \"I had to create a special nomenclature, which served my particular purpose. This nomenclature, which was devised while I was laboring at the telescope and is probably not with out many shortcomings, was retained in my memoir only because it described perfectly what had been seen.\"2 9 He named the bright and dark areas on Mars after terrestrial lands and seas, and did so without apology, since, he explained, in general the configurations seen represented such a clear anal- og y to those of the terrestrial map that it is doubtful whether any other class of names would have been preferable. Do not brevity and clarity also induce us to use such words as island, isthmus) strait) channel) peninsula) cape) etc.? Each of which pro- vides a name and description which expresses well what could not otherwise be expressed except through long paraphrases that would need to be repeated each time one spoke of the co rre ( 7 2 ) T HE P L A N E T M AR S sponding object. .. . In o rder to avoid prejudice regarding the nature of the features on the planet, these names may be regarded as a mere artifice. . . . After all, we speak in a similar way of the seas of the Moon, knowing very well that they do not consist of liquid masses.\" Rather than follow Proctor and use the names of past, and in some casesstill living, observers of th e planet, Schiaparelli drew his appellations from his intimate knowledge of classical literature and the Bible. The ancient Greek founder of physical geography, Di - caearchus, had drawn a line through the middle of his map of th e Mediterranean world running from the pillars of Hercules in th e west to the Taurus Mountains in the east, which he had called the \"great diaphragm .\" Schiaparelli drew a similar line on Mars run- ning between the belt of dark markings to the south and the light er regions to the north. The main dark areas, which were given the names of bodies of water, were, proceeding eastward from the Her- culis Columnae (Columns of Hercules) in the extreme west : Mare Sirenum (Sea of Sirens), Mare Cimmerium (Sea of the Cimmeri- ans), Mare Tyrrhenum (Tyrrhenian Sea), Mare Hadriaticum (Adri- atic Sea), Syrtis Major (Gulf of Sidra), Sinus Sabaeus, Margaritifer Sinus (Pearl-bearing Gulf, the old name for the rich coast of India), Aurorae Sinus (Bay of the Dawn), and Solis Lacus (Lake of the Sun , recalling the legend according to which the Sun rises \"in the baths of the ocean\"). The bright areas were named for lands. Thus Au- sonia (It aly) was separated from Libya by the Tyrrhenian Sea, and other lands included Hellas (Greece), Aeria, Arabia, Eden , Chryse, Tharsis, and Elysium, names which have since become a rich part of Martian lore. \"I do not ask that the [nomenclature] be approved by astrono- mers in general, nor do I request the honor of its universal accep- tance;' Schiaparelli wrote modestly. \"To the contrary, I am ready to accept as final whichever one is recognized by competent au- thority. Until then, however, grant me the chimera of these eu- phonic names, whose sounds awaken in the mind so many beautiful memories.\" 31 The plain fact of the matter is that Schiaparelli had effectiVely refashioned Mars with a set of romantic and wistfully eVOcative names, who se power, despite his stated cautions, was not to be 10 hst On t e human capacity to yearn after lost paradises and 1877 ( 73) waterways, that was adopted in English, with far-reaching cons-, quences.es Schiaparelli's earlier training in draftsmanship had given him the ability \"to transcribe quickl y onto paper the almost cinematic im- pressions of the figures observed in the field of the telescope.\" 36 However, his eye was \"strongly affected by daltonism ,\" or colo-, blindness; thus, as he himself admitted, he \"failed to distinguish gradations of red and green,\" and he onc e described the gener al appearance of the major markings as \"almost like that of a chiaro- scuro made with Chinese ink upon a general bright backg round.\" 37 On the other hand, his color-blindness seems to have made him more sensitive to delicate markings at the threshold of visibility; as a record of fleeting impressions, his observations are unrivaled .3s THE CANALS appeared to Schiaparelli only one or two at a time rather than as a whole network. Moreover, and strangely, they were not always best seen when Mars was nearest the Earth but in some cases long afterward; in the words of Percival Lowell, \"distance .. . is not, with the canals, the great obliteratorr'\"? Some of Schia- parelli 's own notes in this regard are well worth quoting. On Octo- ber 4,18 77, when the planet's disk was 21 \" of arc across, he recorded in the yellow region between Margaritifer Sinus and Aurorae Sinus only the broad Ganges canal, even though he enjoyed moments of perfect definition. The same area remained unchanged when he studied it again in early November, but on February 24 , 1878, on a disk of only 5.r \" are, he found in this hitherto blank region the Indus, which was now \"easily visible .\" Though later observers were baffled by these observations, the re is a perfectly logical explanation. We now know that dust clouds develop on Mars and are especially frequent during summer in the Martian southern hemisphere, when the planet is near perihelion, Though at times only parts of the surface are covered, at other times the clouds may spread into planet-encircling or even global storms enveloping all the surface features; the latter was the case, for example, in 197I. Schiaparelli made pe rhaps the first reliable ob - servations of these clouds. Already at the end of September 1877, he had made out a large, bright cloud east of Solis Lacus . On O cto - ber TO, he found that Mare Erythraeum and Noachis were covered. In beginning his observations that evening, he found that every- (7 6) THE P LA NET MAR S ppeared normal between 2 40 0 and 3500 W longitude; he then thing aPted his observations to secure a set of measures of a new interru that had been discovered a few days earlier by Wilhelm Tern- cornet \" , t Arcetri. On returning to M ars, w ith the central mendian now pd a b k \"M is btanding at 8 0 longitude, he wrote in his note 00: ars IS eau- s,fu1 The Mare Erythraeum in large part appears covered by cloud. tl . hi is dim The continent of Deucalion is hardly observable .Noac IS 1 . fI owever, Arabia is plainly in view, and the Sinus Sabaeus stands I \" 4 0out as wel as ever. In addi tion to these clouds, which stood out in contrast to the dark areas beneath them, the re seemed to be still others in the bright as where \"their presence becomes recog nizable only in a nega-are , tive sense-tha t is, not from what is seen of them, but from what they hide from view,\":\" From September to D ecember 1877, the greater part of the planet between the line of the \"great diaphragm\" and latitude 30Â° N appeared thus \"covered with clouds;' including the conti nental area in which the Indus afterward made its belated appearance. Schiaparelli noted that in the period around opposi- tion, which was shortly before the summer solstice in the southern hemisphere of Mars, clouds and veils were frequent, but that by January, February, and March 1878 the atmosphere of the planet had largely cleared . Thus man y of the canali, hitherto veiled by mists and clouds, were revealed for the first time despite the much reduced size of the disk . SCHIAPARELLI WAS NOT the first to see the canali. A few ill- defined streaks appear in Schroeter's drawings, and there seems to be at least one in a drawing by Beer and Madler; still others were recorded by Secchi, Kaiser, and Lockyer, and D awes was especially prolific in noting them. But with Schiaparelli the canali became the dominant motif of the planet, as a simple glance at his map suffices to show. Ma rtian research, long dominated by a simple \"analogy to the Earth\" approach, and moving confidently forward as ob servers fOund further correspondence at each successive stage of discovery, had clearly entered a startling new phase. 1877 (77) telescope could not be used for this purpose until so late a date; bUt it has shown its great power in such work . . . and has conclusively proved that whatever may have been the condition of the 'COnti_ nent' .previous to July it was certainly in its normal condition from that time onward .\" 24 This was far from the last word. Despite the great power of the Lick astronomers' telescope, their observations proved to be no less subject than others to the always distracting \"person al equa- tion.\" The representations of Holden and Keeler differed marked! not only from those of Schiaparelli and Perrotin but also from on~ another, leading Flammarion to write in near despair: \"Can one really suppose that it is even the same face of the planet that is being depicted here? ... What different aspects!\"25 SCHIAPARELLI USED a new telescope in 1886 and 1888- the ro-inch (49-cm) Merz-Repsold refractor. There is an inte resting story concerning this telescope. Following his 1877 observations of Mars, Schiaparelli had been invited to give a lecture to the Academy of the Lynx-eyed in Rome. The talk was well attended, and he was asked to present the lecture again a few days later to the king and queen of Italy at the Quirinal Palace. This time he hinted that with a telescope as large as the great refractor at the U.S. Naval Ob- servatory in Washington, D. c., then the largest in the world, he would very likely be able to find out even more about Mars, \"a world little different from our own.\" He described his add ress as a \"very exciting phantasmagory,\" and later told Otto Struve that \"by employing a little the Flammarionesque style, I managed the affair rather well\" (the reference being, of course, to the French astro no- mer who was well known for his passionate advocacy of the idea of extraterrestriallife).26 The king and queen were impressed, and when Schiaparelli's request for a larger telescope came before the Chamber of Deputies, it was overwhelmingly approved. Optically, the ro-inch refractor was not quite of the same high standard as the 8.6-inch (zz-cm) Merz, and it suffered fro m a con- siderable blue spectrum; nevertheless, Schiaparelli used it almost exclusively in all his observations from May 1886 onward. In 1886 he had failed to see any geminations, but in 1888 they reappeared once again, and the results he got with the large refractor surpassed ( 86) THE P LAN E T MAR S . xpectations. \"1 believe that 1 saw the planet well enough on 9, hiS e and 27 May;' he told Terby, 25 and 1 began to be almost satisfied, having confirmed at least three or four geminations. But I had a happy surprise on 2 and 4 June; and only then did I have any idea of the power of a ro-inch aper- ture for Mars! I then saw that the memorable days of 1879-80 and 1882had come back for the first time, and that 1 could again see those prodigious images presented in the telescope field as an engraving on steel; again there was all the magic of the details, and my only regret was to have the disk reduced to 12\" in diame- ter. Not only could I confirm the gemination of the Nepenthes (quantum mutatus ab ilia!) and the reappearance of the Triton of 1877, but I could again see Lacus Moeris, reduced to a very small point, but sometimes perfectly visible and scarcely sepa- rated from the Syrtis Major.'? His views of the Boreo-syrtis and neighboring regions were not asclear, however: \"What strange confusion! What can all this mean] Evidently the planet has some fixed geographical details, similar to those of the Earth. . . . Comes a certain moment, all this disappears to be replaced by grotesque polygonations and geminations which, evidently, seem to attach themselves to represent apparently the previous state, but it is a gross mask, and I say almost ridiculous.\" 28 IN 1890,Mars was considerably nearer to the Earth than it had been in 1888, but it was much farther south, making observations from Northern Hemisphere observatories difficult. Schiaparelli wrote to Terby that he had discovered a new set of canals around Solis Lacus and that Solis Lacus itself had been \"unable to escape the principle of doubling which tyrannizes the entire planet: it is cut crosswise by a yellow band dividing into two unequal parts.\" 29 At the Lick Observatory, the results with the largest telescope in the world were no more satisfactory than they had been in 1888. Holden blamed the unusually severe winter weather, which had lasted late into the spring, so that the fine seeing usually found on Mount Hamilton during the summer did not commence until late JUly or August, by which time Mars was receding from the Earth and too low in the west to be well observed. Nevertheless, he took Confirmations and Controversies (87) tinents, \"If the color is of visible ground - that is to say, of the sur- face:' he speculated, \" . . . we can assume that the surfaces are sterile and sandy. [But] to us, it seems impossible to condemn a world to a fate of thi s kind, above all a world in which all the elements of life seem to come together as the y do on Mars .\" 3 8 In stead , he thought, the reddish color must be from vegetation: Why, we may ask, is not the Martian vegetation green ? Wh y should it be?-is the reply. From thi s point of view, there is no reason to regard the Earth as typical in the uni verse. Moreover the terres trial vegetation can itself be reddish, and has been fa; the majority of the continents; the first terrestrial plants were lycopods, whose color is a \"M artian\" reddish yellow. The green substance which gives our vegetation its color-chlorophyll- is made up of two elements; one green, the other yellow. These two eleme nts can be separated by chemical processes . It is there- fore perfectly scientific to admit th at under cond itions different from th ose on Earth, the yellow chlorophyll can exist alone, or be do minant.'? Flammarion main tained that Mars was at a later stage of evolu- tion than Earth, which explained th e relative scarcity of water on its surface and th e comparative smoothness of its continents.'? Moun- tains, he said, are rare, though the terminato r projections proved that some peaks exist. At last he came to the problem of the canals. T his, he acknowl- edge d, was \" th e mos t delica te part\" of his book.\" T hough per- sonally he had succeeded in seeing on ly the broadest of the canals (Nilosyrtis, Ganges, and Indus), he accepted the existence of the Schiaparellian network. But explanation was no t so easy. There was nothing analogous to the canals on Earth. He rejected the idea of th e physicist A. Fizeau that they might be open crevasses in im- mense ice fields, and also the view of E. Penard that they were cracks caused by the cooling of the planet; they were simp ly roo regular to allow such explanations. \"On a globe;' he asked, \"could Nature trace such straight lines, cutting each other in such a fash- ion? . .. The more we look at these drawings, the less that we can attribute them to blind chance.\" 42 In the end, he concluded th at the canals were watercourses, adding: \"The actual conditions on Mars are such that it would be wrong to deny that it could be inhab- ( 94 ) THE P LA NET MAR S , ed by hu man species whose intell igence and methods of action It uld be far su perior to our own.

Indeed, recall that R . S.

The first actual experiments in this direction were made by Charles Piazzi Smyth, who set up a temporary mountain observ~Â­ tor y on the peak of Teneriffe (12,192 ft, or 3,720 m) in 1856. HI S reports, historian of astronomy Agnes M . Clerke later wrote , \"gave Confirmations and Controversies ( 95 ) Speculation has been singularly fruitful as to what the se mark- ings on our next to nearest neighbor in space may mean. Each astronomer holds a different pet th eor y on the subject, and pooh- poohs those of all the others. Nevertheless, the most self-evident explanation from the markings themselves is probably th e true one; namel y, that in th em we are looking upon the result of the work of som e sort of intelligent being s. . . . [T]he amazing blue network on Ma rs hints that one planet besides our own is actu- ally inhabited now. W ith this lecture Lowell had \"taken th e popular side of the most popular scientific question about,\" as W. W. Campbell would later declare.\" and had - in rather unscientific fashion - ann ounced his conclusions before he had even put eye to eyepiece. Lowell documented his arrival at Flagstaff, on May 28, I894, in a letter to his mother, to whom he wrote nearly every day: \"Here on the day. Telescope ready for its Ar izon ian virgin view. . . . Today has been cloudy but now shows signs of a beautiful night and so, not to bed, but to post and then to gaze.\" 23 The two telescopes, the rs- inch Brashear and the rz-inch refractor borrowed from H ar- vard, were mounted together inside the dome designed by Picker- ing (which still lacked its Canvas cover). The astronomers- Lowell, Pickering, and Douglass-had taken temporary accomm odations in a hotel in town, but Lowell and Pickering set up camp in the dome that night to be ready for \"early rising Mars .\" However, they were clouded out, and rain fell through the open dome. Finally, on May 3I, the sky cooperated, and they used the rz -inch refracto r for their first view of the planet. The following night Lowell recorded his first impressions with the rs -inch refractor: \"Southern Sea at end first and Hourglass Sea .. . about equally intense. . . . Ter- minator shaded, limb sharp and mist-covered forked-bay vanishes like river in desert.\"24 Lowell's use of the word desert is remarkable, for it contains the kernel of his later theory about the planet. Per- haps Lowell's imagination had already been captured by the lonely desert south of Flagstaff, whose appearance as seen from one of the San Francisco Range peaks he later described: The resemblance of its lambent saffron to the telescopic tintS of the Martian globe is strikingly impressive . Far forest and still farther desert are transmuted by distance into mere washes of color, the one robin's-egg blue, the other roseate ochre, and so bathed, both, in the flood of sunshine from out of a cloudless burnished sky that th eir tints rival those of a fire-opal. None oth erwise do the Martian colors stand out upon th e disk at the far end of the journey down the telescop e's tube. Even in its mottlings the one expanse recalls the other.\" Lowell and Pickering recorded the canal Lethes on June 7, and Lowell gloated: \"This is the first canal seen here thi s opposition, and in all likelihood the first seen anywhere.\" Two days later he found it \"very broad and glimpsed double,\" but still a novice to the astronomical trade, he doubted himself: \"These sudden revelation peeps may or may not be the truth .\" On June I9 he wrote: \"W ith the best will in th e world I can certainly see no canals.\"26 After only a month of observing, Lowell returned to Boston, leavingthe observatory in the hands of Pickering and Douglass. In Lowell's absence, Pickering attempted to measure the polarization of light from one of the dark areas but found that the reflected light from Mars was not polarized. This meant tha t the area was prob- ably not covered with water.\" Douglass, meanwhile, was verifying Pickering's I892 observation that there were canals crisscrossing the dark areas. The evidence was clearly growing that these areas were not seas after all. But if not seas, then what? Lowell retu rned to Flagstaff in early August. When the observa- tions of Mars had begun, in June, it had been early spring in the Martian sout hern hemisphere; now it was getting into high sum- mer-the souffle-thin polar cap was melting rapidly, and Lowell noted a dark band around it, which he described as a \"ring of antarc- tic ocean.\"28 Later, the antarctic sea also disappeared, while corre- sponding changes took place in the dark areas located in the south- ern hemisphere- what had at first appeared as a uniform dark belt Stretching \"unbroken from the Hourglass Sea [Syrtis Major] to the columnsof H ercules\" had begun to break up into islands and penin- sUlas. \"It will at once be seen how this bit of evidence fits into the other\" L I, owe I suggested. \"If the polar sea were thus to descend in a :~tfreshet toward the equator such are the appearances the freshet fight be expected to present. As the water progressed farther and arther north th e regions it left behind would gradually dry up, and ( ro6) TH E P LAN E T MAR S Lowell (107) at the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh, complained to Ge orge Ellery Hale: \"I dislike his style .. . . It is dogmatic and amateurish, One would think he was the first man to use a telescope on M ars, and that he was entitled to decide offhand questions relating to the efficiency of instruments ; and he draws no line between wh at he sees and what he infers.\" 36 H ale and Keeler, w ho were th e coeditors of the influential Astrophysical Journal) eventually declined to pub- lish any of Lowell's submissions in th eir journal. Lowell's Martian theory immedi atel y made him one of th e mOSt prominent men in Boston, and he did not appear to min d the celeb- rity, at least judging by a vignett e from about thi s tim e related by Ferris G reenslet: He had bo ught for his life en g arfon a sm all high house on the upper side of West Cedar Street. There during the winter a young editor and publisher from New York, passing with a bag of manu- scrip ts to his own modest establishment in the next block, used to observe him every weekday at five-thirty. His handso me head was to be seen vis-a-vis the Boston Evening Transcript beneath a life-sized plaster Venus similar to those that infest th e Athe- naeum. Visibility was perfect, for the shade was alw ays raised to the very top of the window as if to admit no impedi ment to a message from Mars.37 After seeing his book .Mars through the press in De cember 1895, Lowell set sail for Europe to confer with em inent M artian ob servers there. In Paris , he dined with Flammarion in his apart- ment on the Rue Cassini, describing the occasion in a lett er to his father : \"T here were fourteen of us, and all that could sat in chairs of the zodiac, under a ceiling of pale blue sky, appropriately dotted with fleecy clouds, and indeed most prettily painted. Flammarion is nothing if not astronomical. His whole apartment, which is itself au cinquieme, blo ssoms with such decoration.\" 38 In addition to their mutual interest in Mars and extraterrestrial life, the two men shared a fascination with the occult-Lowell, as we have seen, had held seances in his house in Japan, and Flammarion sometimes invited mediums to his Paris apartment. Flammarion had fro m the first commended Lowell for founding \" an observatory insp ired, as t~;; at Iuvisy, with the dominant idea of stu dying the conditions of li d rec' on th e surface of the planets of our system:' 39 He su bsequen Y ( IIO) T HE P L A NE T M AR S nized the importance of Lowell's Martian observ atio ns, which ~re,he wrote, \"of the highest interest, though certainly controver- 'a! and th ey advanc e our knowledge of the planet, even if we do sr , h bri hinot accept them as definiti ve.\"40 He could not, owever, nng irn- If to accept Lowell 's conclusion that the dark areas were tracts of se tation He still regarded them as seas, although, he admitted,vege . they were in many places probably little more th an marshes.\" From . Lowell traveled on to Milan, where he met the man he ad -PariS, mired above all others and always referred to as cher maitreMartien. What Schiaparelli's expectations of the American may have been are less certain, though he later confided to Francois Terby: \" It is certain that Lowell commands superio r means to any hitherto employed on Mars. If his perseverance and enthusiasm do not de sert him, he will make considerable contributions to areography; on the other hand, he needs mo re experience, and must rein in his imagination:'42 At about th is time the Milan astronomer was becoming increas- ingly aware of problems wi th his eyesight; while observing Mars, he confided to Terby, he was troubled by \"a diminution of the sen - sibility to wea k illuminations; I attribute thi s to the observations of Mercury near th e Sun carried out from 1882 to 1890:'43 Moreover, the air over th e growing and increasingly polluted city of Milan was no longer as tranquil as it once was . Finally, in Ma y 1898, Schia- parelli ann ounced his retirement from ob servational work: The time has come to let others take over th e careful study of the pheno mena of Mars. I will publish my ob servations, in the hope th at time will resolve the feeling s of doubt and distrust with which they are received by nearl y one and all. Whoever Wishes to study Mars successfully, must have a keen eye (like my left eye; my right is useless for observations), and must work in a calm atmosphere with a tele scope that is able to concentrate the rays in the red part of the spectrum - the other rays must be eliminated with a colored glass. Add to thi s as prerequisites long practice and great prudence in the conclusions one draws from the observations.44 . But though his eyes were no longer keen enough to place him In the first rank of planetary observers-indeed, he published none of the observations he made after 1890-Schiaparelli nevertheless rem ' atned th e leading authority on Mars, and his pronouncements Lowell ( II I) of large instruments for planetary work. In particular, he declared his skepticism about the canal-filled drawings of Mars made by ob servers (including Williams himself) using small telescop es, and went on to describe the very different result s he had obtained With the great refractor in 1894 : On several occasions during that summer, princip ally whe n the planet was on the meridian shortly after sunr ise-a t which time the conditions . . . are often exceptionally fine at Mount H amil- ton -its surface has shown a wonderful clearne ss and amount of detail. This detail , howe ver, was so intricate, small, and abun- dant, that it baffled all attempts to properly delineate it. Th ough much detail was shown on the bright \"continental\" regions, the grea ter amount was visible on the so-called \"seas.\" Under the best conditions the se dark regions, which are always shown with smaller telescopes as of nearly uniform shade, broke up into a vast amount of very fine details,\" Though he found these details impossible to draw and difficult to describe, Barnard saw, or seemed to see, analogies to the rugged terrain around Mount Hamilton itself: To those, however, who have loo ked down upon a mo un tainous country from a considerable elevation, perhaps some concep- tion of the appearance presented by these dark region s may be had . From what I know of the appearance of the country about Mount Hamilton as seen from the observatory, I can imagine that, as viewed from a very great elevation, thi s region, broken by canyon and slope and ridge , would look just like th e surface of the se Martian \"seas.\"9 No one had ever seen Mars so clearly. The views Barnard had after sunrise with the 36-inch refractor revealed a scene utterly un- like the hard, sharp features sho wn in the average drawings of the day. This new Mars was a revelation. There was nothing artifi- cial looking anywhere on the surface-on thi s last point, at least, Barnard had no doubt. THE LAST important development during the memorable year 1894 was the publication of a provocative paper by th e English astronomer Edward Walter Maunder (fig. 14) . As far back as 1879, FI G UR E 14 . Edward Walter Maunder. (Courtesy Mary Lea Shane Archives of the Lick Observatory) Maunder had made out, at least in qu alified form, some of the Schiaparellian canals, though he had tended to agree with N athaniel Green's interpretation of th em. \"Where I have represent ed shaded districts, [Schiaparelli] has drawn hard lines corresponding with the borders of those districts;' Maunder had declared in 1882, \"so that where he has given a number of parallel and interlacing lines, I should myself have rather shown faint shaded districts between thOse lines.\" 10 He now looked at th e canal que stion from a new per- spe . CtlVe th at went far toward resolving the \"canal deadlock .\" ( lI S) T HE PLA NE T MAR S How the EyeInterprets ( lI 9) po sit on the surface. Thus the conclusion once again seemed to follow: the caps mu st be water ice. EVEN I F they were formed of water ice however the cap, , s un- do~b~edly contained only minute quantities of water. From the rapidity of their melting, de Vaucouleurs estimated th at they were only a few centimeters thick. Thus, the planet was obviously ex- tremelyarid. Lowell had compared the salmon -colored areas of the planet to the Painted Desert of Arizona. There had never been any doubt tha this is what they were -dusty deserts, desolate almost beyond the ability of anyone to imagine and vast by terrestrial standards, since altogether they occupied an area ten times larger than the com- bined areas of the Saharan , Libyan, and Nubian Deserts on Earth. As for their composition, the pioneering polariscopic observations of Bernard Lyot, who studied the specific way light was reflected from Mars and compared it with that of various minerals, indi- cated that the deserts might be covered with a layer of volcanic ash. Later, Audouin Dollfus demonstrated a close match with pulver- ized limonite, a compound rich in iron oxides. The seasonal wave of darkening affecting the dark areas also seemed to be well established. Again, Lowell's observations were largely confirmed, and indeed embellished, by a number of other skillful observers of the planet. Thus Fournier wrote: \"As the spring advances, the dark shading progressively encroaches from the pole towards the equator across the seas. Th is advance, across wide ex- panses and along channels, takes place at a variable speed, but nearly always very rapidly; a few weeks only suffice to change the land- scape cornplerelv\">' Some of the markings seemed to change in a regul ar way with the seasons-for example, Antoniadi claimed that Syrtis Major ap- peared broad and dark in winter, narrow and weak in summer; Pando rae Fretum underwent a pronounced darkening each sum- mer, and so on. Still other changes did not appear to be seasonal. Thus Nep enthes-Thorh showed a dramatic broadening in 1888 and again between I9II and 1929; and Solis Lacus, whose classical form had been an ellipse with its long axis lying east-west, underwent a marked tran sformation in 1926 so that its long axis ran north and sout h. These changes were carefully recorded by Antoniadi, who (15 6 ) THE PLANET MAR S was certain that they were due to \"an invasion by the dark or green- ish vegetation on to the lightly-shaded or rosy areas adjacent to the d k \" 22great ar areas. The changes of color that affected the dark markings also seemed to be seasonal. Lowell , to whom the disk presented \"washes of color, the one robin's-egg blue, the other roseate ochre,\" had re- marked that some of the dark areas changed from bluish green to brown and then to yellow with the arrival of midsummer in the southern hemisphere, reminding him of the changes observed in terrestrial vegetation during dry summers and autumn. Anto- niadi paid no less minute attention to the coloring of the planet . In 1924, he and his associate Fernand Baldet described complex color changes spreading from the polar regions. \"Not only the green areas;' An toniadi wrote, \"but also the greyish or blue sur- faces, turned under my eyes to brown, lilac-brown or even carmine, while other green or bluish regions remained unaffected. . . . It was almost exactly the color of leaves which fall from trees in summer and autumn in our latitudes.\"23 These observations were somewhat suspect because they were made with large refractors, in which chro matic aberration can never be entirely eliminated . Observations with reflectors were less objec- tionable. Thus E. E. Barnard, using the 6o-inch (I.52-m) reflector at Mount Wilson in I9II, described the disk of Mars as \"feeble salmon;' while dark markings such as Syrtis Major and Mare Tyrrhe- num were \"light-gray.\" 24 G. P. Kuiper, using the Sz-inch reflector at McDonald O bservatory, similarly found that in the spring of 1956 the dark areas were predominantly neutral gray, although he also noted \"a touch of moss green\" in some of the equatorial regions .\" The greenish colors naturally suggested chlorophyll. Chloro- phyll looks green because it reflects light in the green part of the spectrum ; however, it absorbs strongly in the infrared . Therefore, if the dark areas on Mars contained chlorophyll-bearing plants, they ought to look dark in infrared photographs. In fact, however, just the opp osite was true. Thus, any plants on Mars could not contain chlorophyll; instead, they were widely believed to be primitive but hardy organisms, perhaps similar to terrestrial lichens. Various attempts were made to detect the presence of organic materials spectroscopically, and there was a brief flurry of excite- ment in 1959 when W. M . Sinton announced that he had found The Ling ering Romance (1 57 ) Mars, had been inspired by the publication of this book\" (c.

Wrote Wallace: \"The figure he uses in his calculations for the actu al albedo of the earth, 0.75, is also not only improbable, but almost self- contradictory, because the albedo of cloud is 0.72, and th at of the great cloud -covered planet, Jupiter, is given by Lowell as~o:75, while Zollner made it on ly 0.62. Again , Lowell gives Venus an albedo of 0.92, while Zo llner made it only 0.50 and Mr. Gore 0.65. This show s the extreme un- certainty of these estimates, while the fact that both Venus and Jupiter are who lly cloud-covered, wh ile we are only half-covered, renders it almost certain that our albedo is far less than Mr. Lowell made it. It is evident that mathematical calculations fou nded upon such un certain data cann ot yield trustworth y results. But this is by no means the only case in which the data employed in thi s paper are of uncertain value.. .. It requires a prac- ticed mathematician, and one fully acquainted with the extensive literatu re of this subject, to examine these various data, and track them th rough the maze of formulae and figures so as to deter mine to what extent they affect the final result \" (Is Ma rs Habitable?p. 51). 47.

Some of the Viking I orbiter images revealed a cloud that cast a shadow of unusual shape that was consistent with an erup tion , and was tentatively identified by Leonard Martin of the Lowell Observatory as a steam vent; it is located at 79Â° w, 16Â° s, between Solis Lacus and Tithonius Lacus, near the location where the Japanese observers recorded their flares. 32.

Tombaugh's view is that \"the Martian canals were glob al fracture fault lines, perhaps induced by intern al heating and expansion, bursting a thick rigid crust at the round spots known as oases, or tr iggered by aster- oid impacts at the round spots known as oases\" (Clyde W.

Among others who recognize d that a flat Mars did not follow from the apparently smooth terminator was V. A. Firsoff, who wrote in Our Neighbour Worlds (London: Hutch inson , 1952), p. 23: \"O n the Moon five-power binoculars will reveal a wealth of detail , but if her phase is full the moun tains will not stand out clearly, as they cast no visible shadows. This is how we see Mars at opposition thro ugh the most powerful telescopes . . .. Moreover, Mars has a sensible atmosphere, and , although this is remarkab ly transparent, it does intervene, especially at the limb or terminato r, where accidents of the terrain will show best . To sum up , it is perhaps not very significant that no mountains or marked dif- ferences in altitude of the ground have been discovered on Mars by direct observation, and our estimates of heights and depressions on his surface must needs be somewhat problematic.\" 36.

During the I89 0S and early I9 00S, Percival Lowell, who saw only one dust cloud during eleven years of observation, wrote in Mars and Its Canals (p. 89) : \"If we are uncertain of the precise character of the Martian climate, we know on the ~ther hand a good deal about the Martian weather. A pleasing absence of It over much of the planet distinguishes Martian conditions from our own. That we can scan the surface as we do without practical interruption day in and day out proves the weather over it to be permanently fair. In fact a clear sky, except in winter, and in many places even then, is not only the rule, but the rule almost without exceptions. In the early days of Martian stu dy cases of ob- scuration were recorded from time to time by ob servers, in which portions of the disk were changed or hidden as if clouds were veiling them from view. More modern observations fail to support this deduction, partl y by absence of instances, partly by other explanation of the facts. Certainly the recorded instances are very rare.\" 14. For obl iquitie s above 54Â°, the average yearly solar insolation be- comes greater at the poles than at the equator (this is actually the case for Uranus, with obliquity 9 7.9 Â°, and the Pluto-Charon system, with obliquity II8 .5 Â°). 15.

In this respect , the July IO , 1986, oppositio n was one of the Worst pos- sible, since despite the large apparent diameter (22\" of arc) the planet was almost as far south as it can get-between - 230 and -28 0-th roughout the prime observing window. On the other hand, condition s at the Sep- tember 28, 1988, opposition were as favorable as they had been at any time since 1909-the apparent diameter was 23\", and the planet lay close to the celestial equator so that an observer at mid-northern latitudes had to peer through only half as much air mass as was necessary in 1986. 2.

These disto rtions are further compounded by a poor signal-to-noise ratio .\" On the oth er hand, he noted that \"when one views video pictures at rates above the threshold for 'flicker fusion: our eye-brain combination fills in part s of the picture that are missing for short intervals. . . . By filling in or 'integrat ing' the scenes, we average out noise and smo oth out incrementally displaced or distorted images\" (Thomas Dobbins to William Sheehan, personal cor- respondence, February 17, 1995).
