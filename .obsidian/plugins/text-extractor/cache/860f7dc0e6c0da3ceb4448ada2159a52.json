Two examples of such phases, which are the subject of this work, are gapped Quantum Spin Liquids and Fractonic systems. Our purpose is to inves- tigate topological-like effective ﬁeld theories descriptions for several exactly solvable models of 2D quantum spin liquids and 3D fractonic systems. We do that by taking the continuum limit of the theory after using an explicit map between the micro and macroscopic degrees of freedom. Moreover, besides the study of well known lattice models, we also propose a 2D Type-I lattice fracton model, which is exactly solvable and is topologically ordered. In addi- tion to those, this work reviews a few fracton mechanisms, such as exactly solvable models, coupled-layer constructions, and bottom-up approaches to effective descriptions. v Acknowledgements I want to immensely thank my advisor Pedro Gomes who has guided me towards the steps to become a researcher in theoretical Physics.

These simple features are the keystones in order to isolate a given phenomenon and study it. In addition, physical systems also present distinct qualitative properties as the number of constituents N is increased. Indeed, as we in- crease N new phenomena are able to emerge and the description of the system may eventually become quite complicated [2]. Depending on how large N is, new approaches and theories are needed in order to describe the physics of such systems. Roughly, N ∼ 1 Quantum mechanics N ∼ 10 − 100 Atomic Physics N ∼ 100 − 10 5 Chemestry N ≳ 10 5 Condensed matter physics. In the last few decades, condensed matter physics has been an effervescent research area with interdisciplinary interests, ranging from pure theoretical descriptions to quantum com- puting technology. In this way, it provides a rich laboratory to develop and test theoretical ideas describing interesting phenomena. With the proper technology, materials can be sub- mitted to extreme conditions of temperature and external ﬁelds, so that quantum effects are macroscopically visible. Such systems are denoted as quantum matter, where impressive phe- nomena may emerge due to high-entanglement and strong interactions among the constituents [3]. Quasi-particle excitations with exotic properties are a signature of a strong coupled physical system. Within the context of quantum matter, quasi-particles usually emerge in topologically ordered systems [4, 5]. The most prominent example is the Quantum Hall system [6]. Such ex- citations are called anyons and possess intriguing properties like fractional charge and statistics [7]. In the last decades, new kinds of topologically ordered systems were discovered, as the Quantum Spin Liquids (QSL) and, more recently, the so-called fractonic phases. Quantum Spin Liquids are quantum phases of matter whose topological ordering proper- ties emerge from spin ﬂuctuations [8]. This is in contrast with the Quantum Hall ﬂuids, where the topological nature follows from correlations between charged degrees of freedom. In QSL, the quantum states present a high degree of entanglement between all spins of the system. It means that one cannot perform a local measurement in the system without affecting all other spins. The severe entanglement of the quantum states is the essential ingredient for the emer- gence of exotic properties, as non-local quasi-particles and robust gapped states [4]. Although they may be very complicated systems, they provide beautiful theoretical descriptions along with deep physical insights. 2 Chapter 1. Introduction Fractons were ﬁrstly realized in certain 3D lattice models involving only local interactions between spin degrees of freedom [9–11]. In addition to certain topological aspects, they exhibit even more exotic properties, such as restricted mobility: they typically move in planes, lines or are completely immobile [12, 13]. Furthermore, certain low-energy properties carry ultraviolet information (UV/IR mixing), in contradiction to the usual property of decoupling of scales [14]. These unusual characteristics make the problem of ﬁnding low-energy descriptions very challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for fractonic systems have been proposed, as gapless higher-rank gauge theories [15], topological-like gapped ﬁeld theories [16–18], stacks of coupled layers [19], and parton constructions [20]. The theoretical description of the above systems can be done in principle from two perspec- tives. One can start from a microscopic description, with an underlying lattice structure, or one can start directly from the macroscopic point of view, in terms of low-energy descriptions. The central purpose of this work is to investigate the interplay between these two approaches in the context of QSL and fractonic systems. We consider several exactly solvable lattice models and discuss how to ﬁnd the corresponding effective ﬁeld theories. The main original results contained in this work are: i) Derivation of the low-energy effective ﬁeld theory for the ZN Toric code; ii) Derivation of an effective description for the Wen plaquette model; iii) Construction of a two-dimensional Type-I fracton model; iv) Derivation of an effective ﬁeld theory for the above fracton model; v) Study of general properties of 2D Chern-Simons-like fractonic theories. This work is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we review general properties of topological ﬁeld theories, which are useful throughout the work. In addition, we brieﬂy review QSL and fracton phenomenology. In order to acquire some intuition about lattice models and their ef- fective ﬁeld theories, in Chapter 3, we study 2D topologically ordered systems, such as the Z2 lattice gauge model and exactly solvable QSL models (Toric Code and Wen Plaquette model). In Chapter 4, we study three 3D exactly solvable lattice fracton models: the X-Cube, Chamon, and Haah codes. In Chapter 5, we discuss the coupled layers construction, which is able to per- turbatively recover the X-cube model from coupled stacks of 2D Toric codes. In Chapter 6, we investigate bottom-up approaches for continuum effective ﬁeld theories for fractonic systems. Finally, in Chapter 7, we explicitly derive the effective ﬁeld theory in a top-down approach for the X-Cube model, the Chamon code, and also for a 2D Type-I fracton system. 3 Chapter 2 Topological Phases of Matter In this chapter we review some properties of topological quantum ﬁeld theories, as the emergence of anyons and the ground state degeneracy. In addition, we review some properties of quantum spin liquids and we brieﬂy summarize the main characteristics of fractonic phases of matter. 2.1 Topological Quantum Field Theory Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFT) are a class of quantum ﬁeld theories which are an indispensable keystone in modern theoretical physics. TQFT emerge naturally in the low- energy limit of effective theories for topological phases of matter as, for example, the Quantum Hall Effect. For the purposes of this work, we discuss two types of topological quantum ﬁeld theories, namely, Abelian Chern-Simons and BF theories. Chern-Simons theories are expressed as local terms in the Lagrangian for gauge ﬁelds. They can be seen as “kinetic terms” for gauge ﬁelds which are able to capture topological aspects of the underlying manifold and gauge group. Let us consider the Abelian Chern-Simons action deﬁned over three dimensional manifold M SCS = k 4π ∫ M d3xϵµνρaµ∂νaρ, (2.1) with aµ an U(1) gauge ﬁeld and k a dimensionless parameter, called the Chern-Simons level. For the case in which the underlying gauge group is non-Abelian, cubic terms ∼ aµaνaρ also contribute for the CS action. Due to the Levi-Civita symbol structure, the CS theory can only be deﬁned on odd spacetime dimensions. In section 6.2, however, we will see a generalization of it in order to describe 3 + 1 dimensional systems. Up to boundary terms, the Chern-Simons theory is invariant under gauge transformations aµ → aµ + ∂µα. It is also invariant under the Poincare group. We can see the topological character of the Chern-Simons term by noting that it does not depend on the metric of the manifold M. In fact we can write such term in a metric-free way SCS = k 4π ∫ M a ∧ da (2.2) with a a one-form, d the exterior derivative and ∧ the wedge product between them. The Chern-Simons theory does not require a metric space, that is, the notion of distances and an- gles are not important for its physics. The theory is invariant under manifolds continuous deformations. In mathematics, we call such transformations homeomorphisms and that is the 4 Chapter 2. Topological Phases of Matter reason we call such ﬁeld theory topological. As we will see in the following and through ex- amples in Section 3, the topological aspect of such theories plays a major role in the robustness of the low-energy properties of topological phases of matter. Let us now analyze the physics contained in the Chern-Simons theory. Let fµν = ∂µaν − ∂νaµ ne the U(1) gauge invariant ﬁeld strength associated to the aµ ﬁelds. The classical theory has the equations of motion fµν = 0 ⇔ da = 0, (2.3) which tell us the local physics it contains is trivial: There are no gauge invariant propagating degrees of freedom. Let j a one-form subjected to the conservation law d ⋆ j = 0. The coupling to matter ﬁelds can be performed by the current term LCS − a ∧ ⋆j, which leads to classical equations of motion fµν = 2π k ϵµνρ jρ, jµ = (ρ, j1, j2). (2.4) It attaches magnetic ﬂux to the matter density 2πρ = kB. This is, together with its topological aspect, the most striking feature of Chern-Simons theories. The role of the CS theory is to attach magnetic ﬂux to the excitations, which transmutes their statistics. In the process to exchange two identical particles, they feel an Aharonov-Bhom effect due to each other the magnetic ﬁeld that contributes to the statistical phase [21] ν = 1 2k . (2.5) For ν = 0 and ν = 1 we have bosons and fermions, respectively. For arbitrary ν, we have anyons. Even in the presence of matter, the CS theory has no propagating degrees of freedom. Upon quantization, it will give us a fully gapped theory. Albeit it has a gapped spectrum, it may gives us interesting physics. If the underlying manifold M has nontrivial topology, nontrivial physics may emerge. In this case, another class of gauge invariant objects are present in the theory: Wilson loops. Wilson loops are holonomies around non-contractible closed loops γ on the manifold W(γ) = exp (i ∮ γ a) . (2.6) For simplicity, let us consider the case in which the manifold is homeomorphic to a T2 × R =homeo M, with T2 a genus 1 torus. In coordinates, it means the opposite edges in both directions x and y of a plane are identiﬁed, as in Figure 2.1. For such case, where the manifold FIGURE 2.1: Torus as a plane with identiﬁed edges. In such topological space there are two non-contractible loops. 2.1. Topological Quantum Field Theory 5 topology is nontrivial, large gauge transformations α are allowed. Such transformations receive this name because they have a global aspect and cannot be continuously deformed into the identity α = 0. Namely α(x, y) = 2πn1x1 L1 + 2πn2x2 L2 , n1, n2 ∈ Z. (2.7) They wind around the two spatial directions of the L1 × L2 torus n1 times around a given direction and n2 around the other. This class of gauge transformations leave the Wilson loops invariant ai → ai + 2πni Li , W(γi) → exp (i ∮ γi aidxi + 2πni ) (2.8) with γi being a closed curve around the i-th direction of the torus. Under canonical quantization, a non-vanishing commutator is induced between the conju- gated ﬁelds a1 and a2 [a1(⃗x, t), a2(⃗y, t)] ≡ − 2πi k δ(2) (⃗x − ⃗y) (2.9) and consequently W(γ1)W(γ2) = e 2πi k W(γ2)W(γ1). (2.10) The above expression tell us that the ground state is k−fold degenerated. In fact, for a genus g manifold, the ground state is kg-fold degenerate [6], indicating the CS sensitivity to the mani- fold topology. The global aspect of such operators indicate us how robust is the ground state degeneracy. Any local operator to be added in the Lagrangian does not split the degeneracy, in contrast to usual quantum theories. Other class of TQFT frequently used in this work is the BF theory. BF-theories can be thought as generalizations of Chern-Simons theories for arbitrary spacetime dimensions D. In general, they involve topological interaction terms A ∧ dB, with a a one-form and c a (D − 2)−form ﬁelds SBF = k 2π ∫ M a ∧ dc. (2.11) As the CS theory, the above action contains no local gauge invariant degrees of freedom. In- stead, the relevant degrees of freedom are the Wilson lines and their “dual”, t’Hooft operators W(γ) = exp(i ∮ γ a) and V(Σ) = exp(i ∮ Σ c), (2.12) for a closed curve γ and a closed (D − 2)-surface. From now, we are mainly interested in the case D = 2 + 1 dimensions. In this case, both the Wilson and t’Hooft operators are string- like, dc is the topological conserved current, and the BF term corresponds to the coupling of a current with a vector ﬁeld a. The physics contained in the BF theory is very similar to Chern-Simons in the sense that it is sensitive to the topology of the underlying manifold M and it attaches magnetic ﬂux to matter in the presence of external currents. The main difference is that, when put on a nontrivial manifold, large-gauge transformations leave both operators (2.12) invariant. In the case that M =homeo T2 × Z , for any closed loops which transverse the system in the 1 and 2 directions, 6 Chapter 2. Topological Phases of Matter the operators obey W(γ2)V(γ1) = e 2πi k V(γ1)W(γ2) and V(γ2)W(γ1) = e 2πi k W(γ1)V(γ2). (2.13) Each one of the algebras (2.13) have a k-dimensional representation, leading to a k2-fold ground state degeneracy. It can be seen by considering the set {∣ ∣nx, ny〉} of Ax and Ay eigen- states with eigenvalues Ai |nx⟩ = e2πini/k |nx⟩. From the algebras in (2.13) we see that V(γ1) (W(γ2) ∣ ∣nx, ny〉) = e 2πi(nx −1) k (W(γ2) ∣ ∣nx, ny〉) (2.14) V(γ2) (W(γ1) ∣ ∣nx, ny〉) = e 2πi(ny +1) k (W(γ1) ∣ ∣nx, ny〉) , (2.15) with ni = 0, . . . , k − 1 for i = 1 and 2. The role of the V(γi) operator is either to measure the c ﬂux through the i direction or to insert a ﬂux through the i⊥ direction. The same is valid for the W(γ) operators. In general, for a manifold M with genus g the ground state degeneracy is k2g [6]. In summary, TQFT are very useful to describe topological phases of matter and are able to account for the ground state degeneracy, the fully gapped spectrum, the phase robust character and the emergence of quasi-particles. 2.2 Quantum Spin Liquids Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are insulating phases of spin-materials that do not present spontaneous magnetization, even at very low temperatures (T ∼ 0). Such phases usually present interesting features, as the presence of excitations with fractional statistics and the emergence of gauge ﬁelds. The high entangled nature of these phases provides their nontrivial properties, which make them of great interest in physics, and also make them challenging. There are many spin liquid phases which behave differently, amid a bunch of these present the same geometrical symmetries. Thereby, dealing with order transitions between such phases, Landau theory of phase transitions is not applicable: a topological phase transition theory is required. It is important to say that not all spin liquids present topological ordering, as gapless QSL for example [4]. Also worth of mention, is that QSL may exist in both 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions [22]. Unfortunately, so far QSL were not experimentally observed, and their study hides some giant difﬁculties. The high degree of interaction needed among the constituents of the system and the difﬁculty to deal with decoherence in ordinary materials are the main difﬁculties in experimental QSL research. In the theoretical context, the strongly interacting character of QSL usually makes them non-perturbative systems. In this fashion, even the theoretical description of QSL is not an easy task. There are several approaches which have been used to study and explore QSL physics, as slave-particles decomposition and mean-ﬁeld theory. We will explore exactly solvable gapped quantum spin liquids, as the two-dimensional lattice models Toric Code and Wen Plaquette model (See Chapter 3). Let HQSL be a quantum lattice Hamiltonian describing a gapped quantum spin liquid. Its ground state usually presents a certain kind of entangled ordering, which is not magnetic since ⟨0| ⃗Si |0⟩ = 0, (2.16) 2.3. Fractons 7 where i represents the lattice site. Such property plays an important role in QSL. If we allow perturbations in the original Hamiltonian H = HQSL − ∑ i ⃗h · ⃗Si, (2.17) we see that they have no crucial role in lifting the ground state degeneracy ⟨H⟩ = ⟨HQSL⟩ −〈∑i⃗h · ⃗Si〉 = ⟨HQSL⟩. This is a consequence of the robust topological character of the ground state degeneracy. The high degree of entanglement may allow non-local excitations, that is, excitations that can only be created by non-local operators. Although the system may be constituted of only bosonic spin degrees of freedom, excitations with fractional quantum numbers may emerge as a result of the underlying entanglement. The work in Ref. [8] provides an extensive review on the topic, regarding theoretical ad- vances and potential experimental platforms of QSL. 2.3 Fractons A general feature of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasi-particles with exotic properties, such as fractional statistics and fractional charge. In fractonic topological phases of matter, quasi-particles with “fractional mobility” appear. Such particles are called fractons and have their mobility restricted to sub-manifolds. They are called sub-dimensional particles and, for three dimensional systems, are usually classiﬁed as: • Fractons - Excitations whose mobility is completely restricted, they cannot move at all as individual excitations; • Lineons - Particles which can move only along lines; • Planons - Particles which can move only along two dimensional manifolds, usually planes. We refer as fractonic phases of matter physical systems whose excitations are fractons. Such phases are topologically ordered in the sense that they present topological properties, as ground state topology dependence, robust phenomenology against perturbations and emer- gent quasi-particles. Although there are several works in three-dimensional gapped fracton systems, it is believed that they do not exist in 2 + 1 dimensions. We propose an example of such system, both in the lattice and in continuum, in Section 7.1. Even though fracton phases are topologically ordered, they are not truly topological. Gen- eral properties of such systems are UV/IR mixing and that the ground state degeneracy de- pends on the size of the system. In contrast to truly topological systems (See Section 2.1), the fractonic ones are not invariant under continuous deformations. Within the context of fractonic systems, they are usually classiﬁed in two groups: • Type I - Fractons per se are immobile particles. However, they are able to move along the system as part of bound states with other fractons; • Type II - Fractons do not move at all. The dependence of ground state degeneracy (GSD) on the system size places a big challenge in ﬁnding continuous ﬁeld descriptions of such systems. One of the main principles of effective ﬁeld descriptions is the decoupling of the physics in distinct scales. The fact that the long 8 Chapter 2. Topological Phases of Matter wavelength physics must take into account what happens on short lengths goes against the renormalization group philosophy and signals an IR/UV scales mixing in the underlying ﬁeld theory [14]. In this sense, effective ﬁeld theories for fractons cannot be TQFT’s, but must be, somehow, similar to them. 9 Chapter 3 Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories In this chapter we will study the properties of two-dimensional lattice models as well as their Effective Field Theories (EFT). First, we will study, in some details, the properties of the Z2 lattice gauge theory and its corresponding EFT. Then, we will study other two 2D lattice models, the Toric Code and Wen Plaquette model, which are both exactly solvable models and correspond to gapped quantum spin liquids. 3.1 Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory The Z2 lattice gauge theory is the simplest gauge theory that presents nontrivial topological order: deﬁned on a torus, its ground state has a four-fold topological degeneracy. Due to its simplicity, in this section we study this system in a very detailed way. We mainly follow the references [4] and [23]. Let Λ be a L × L square lattice, constituted by N sites (vertices of the lattice), with periodic boundary conditions in both directions, forming a torus. We deﬁne a qubit degree of freedom on every link ℓ of the lattice. It is useful to denote the link ℓ = (ij) in terms of the sites i and j that it connects to. The Hilbert space per link Hℓ is two-dimensional and the total Hilbert space is given by the product of them H = ∏ℓ ⊗Hℓ. Albeit dim(H) = ∏ℓ dim(Hℓ) = 22N, we do not observe this amount of physical states. The role of the Z2 gauge structure is to identify different qubit conﬁgurations as the same physical state. In order to fully characterize the physical properties of this system, we will deﬁne a subspace Hphys composed of all the physical states. In order to deﬁne the quantum Hamiltonian of this system, we write the local operators which act on the qubits in terms of the Pauli operators Zℓ and Xℓ. The Hamiltonian is deﬁned as HZ2 = −g ∑ p ∏ ℓ∈∂p Zℓ − t ∑ ℓ Xℓ, (3.1) where g and t are coupling constants, p is a square plaquette and ∂p is its boundary. Let us denote the set of four links ℓ connected to the lattice site i as the star set si and consider the 10 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories local operator Gi = ∏ ℓ∈si Xℓ, (3.2) which obeys G2 i = 1. This operator anti-commutes with the Zℓ Pauli operator if ℓ ∈ si and trivially commutes with it otherwise. In another words it “ﬂips” the z-component spin of the four qubits lying in the star si GiZℓGi = −Zℓ, ℓ ∈ si. (3.3) These operators generate the Z2 gauge structure for the model, locally acting on the sites. The identity element of this group is the non-action of Gi in any site, that is, the identity op- erator I = ∏ ⊗Iℓ. As mentioned before, the gauge structure identiﬁes different qubit conﬁg- urations as the same physical state. We say that two qubit conﬁgurations |ψ1⟩ , |ψ2⟩ ∈ H are gauge equivalent if |ψ2⟩ = G |ψ1⟩ for some element G of the Z2 gauge group . This relation de- ﬁne an equivalence relation which enable us to deﬁne a physical Hilbert space Hphys ∼= H/ ∼ identifying all the equivalent spin conﬁgurations with an unique physical state. The Hamiltonian HZ2 is invariant under gauge transformations [Gi, HZ2] = 0 ∀i ∈ Λ, (3.4) which follows from the fact that there is always an even number of Zℓ operators emanating from each site i. The dimension of the physical Hilbert space is dim(H) divided by the number of indepen- dent gauge transformations. Naively, since there are N lattice sites, one can think that there are 2N independent gauge transformations. However, to correctly count dim(Hphys) it is useful to introduce the Invariant Gauge Group (IGG). The IGG is a subgroup of Z2 gauge group, com- posed by all the elements that leave all qubit conﬁgurations invariant. For this model, the IGG contains only two elements: the Gi action in every lattice site and the identity element: IGG = { ∏ ∀i∈Γ Gi, I}. (3.5) The existence of a nontrivial Invariant Gauge Group causes a reduction of the number of inde- pendent gauge transformations. To see this, let us consider two spin conﬁguration |ψ1⟩ , |ψ2⟩ ∈ H and keep in mind that, by deﬁnition, ˜G |ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩ for any |ψ⟩ ∈ H and ˜G ∈ IGG. Then, if these two spin conﬁgurations are gauge equivalent |ψ2⟩ = G |ψ1⟩ for some element G of the Z2 gauge group, it is also gauge equivalent for an element G ˜G, since |ψ2⟩ = G( ˜G |ψ1⟩) = G ˜G |ψ1⟩. The two distinct group elements G and G ˜G actually perform the same gauge transformation, as ilustred in Figure 3.1. In general, for a ﬁnite gauge group G, the number of independent gauge transformation is given by the coset G/IGG. In our case there are 2N/2 independent gauge transformations and then 22N/ (2N/2) = 2N+1 distinct physical states, gauge inequivalent to each other. The g and t parameters of the Hamiltonian set two energy scales. In the following, we analyze how the system behaves in extreme limits of such parameters. What we see is that this system present different behaviors depending on the relation between those parameters. In one regime we have a topological deconﬁned phase and in the other we have a non-topological conﬁned phase: 3.1. Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory 11 FIGURE 3.1: Two distinct gauge group elements lead to the same qubit conﬁgu- ration. Both elements are identiﬁed in the coset G/IGG. • g ≫ t: For t → 0, the ground state minimizes the plaquette terms Bp with eigenvalues +1 for every p. We can explicitly ﬁnd the system ground state introducing the product state |⇑⟩ = ∏ℓ ⊗ |↑ℓ⟩, with |↑ℓ⟩ ∈ Hℓ. Although this state minimizes the system energy, it is not invariant under gauge transformations. One can construct a gauge invariant ground state performing the gauge transformation |0⟩ = ∏ i∈Λ (1 + Gi) |⇑⟩ . (3.6) The energy of such states is E0 = −gN, (3.7) and the low-energy excitations, siting in the plaquette p, correspond to negative eigen- value states of the plaquette operator Bp. We call such excitations visions and they corre- spond to a nontrivial Z2 ﬂux through a plaquette. They can be created by applying the Xℓ Pauli operator on some link ℓ. The fact that every link is shared by two plaquettes forces these excitations to be created in pairs. The local action of the Pauli operator on a link creates two excitations. In order to have a locally isolated excitation, one must apply a Xℓ operators along a string. Explicitly, let γ∗ be a string deﬁned in the dual lattice with endpoints in the plaquettes a and b, then Bp ( ∏ ℓ∈γ∗ Xℓ |0⟩ ) = f p ( ∏ ℓ∈γ∗ Xℓ |0⟩ ) , with f p = {−1, p = a or b, +1, otherwise, (3.8) which tell us this state has one excitation in each endpoint of γ∗, as indicated in the Figure 3.2. FIGURE 3.2: Visions (red plaquettes), created in the endpoints of the string γ∗ in the dual lattice. The notation ℓ ∈ γ∗ means that the link ℓ crosses γ∗. There are no local operators which creates a single Z2 excitation - this characteristic is 12 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories topological in the sense that it survives to perturbations and to the introduction of new degrees of freedom. This phase is gapped: the energetic cost to create a pair of excitations is very large ∆E ∼ 4g. The gapped character of topological phases makes them very robust against perturbations. The topological character of this phase becomes clear once we realize that the ground state is not unique. Actually, deﬁned on a torus, the ground state has a four-fold degeneracy. Indeed, we have a hint of such degeneracy if we try to label our physical states through the gauge invariant Z2-ﬂux through a plaquette p. Since there are N plaquettes with eigenvalues Bp = ±1 under the constraint ∏ p Bp = 1, (3.9) we have only 2N/2 gauge invariant labels, which cannot label all the 2N+1 physical states. Let us show explicitly the degeneracy, by showing at ﬁrst that the gauge group operators Gi do not exhaust the set of commuting operators with the Hamiltonian. Deﬁne the non- local operators V1 = ∏ ℓ∈γ∗ 1 Xℓ , V2 = ∏ ℓ∈γ∗ 2 Xℓ (3.10) W1 = ∏ ℓ∈γ1 Zℓ , W2 = ∏ ℓ∈γ2 Zℓ (3.11) with γa and γ∗ a , for a = 1, 2, closed paths along the i-axis of the torus deﬁned on the lattice and the dual lattice, respectively (Figure 3.3). From their deﬁnition, follows from the Pauli operators algebra that V1W2 = −W2V1, V2W1 = −W1V2, (3.12) with all other commutators vanishing. The Wa operators are called Wegner-Wilson loop operators and they play an important role in our analysis because they are gauge invari- ant objects [Wa, Gi] = 0. FIGURE 3.3: Closed strings in the direct and dual lattice along both x1 and x2 directions. When V1 or V2 act on the ground state |0⟩, they ﬂip every spin located at the links which cross these x1 or x2 lines. Since [V1, H] = [V2, H] = 0 the states V1 |0⟩ , V2 |0⟩ , and V1V2 |0⟩ (3.13) 3.1. Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory 13 are also eigenstates of HZ2 with energy E0. One could ask if these three states are not simply gauge equivalent conﬁgurations to |0⟩. They are not. Note that the ground state |0⟩ obeys W1 |0⟩ = |0⟩ and W2 |0⟩ = |0⟩ . (3.14) The eigenvalue of the Wa operators is a gauge invariant quantity, that is, there is no way to change it through gauge transformations. From the anti-commutation relation (3.12) follows that all other states in (3.13) have different gauge invariant eigenvalues. As an example: W2V1 |0⟩ = −V1W2 |0⟩ = −V1 |0⟩ and W1V1 |0⟩ = V1W1 |0⟩ = V1 |0⟩ . (3.15) Similar analysis follows for the other two states. Thus, these are indeed four physical degenerate states. Now, the 2N/2 gauge invariant Bp and the four fold degeneracy are enough to characterize every2N/2 × 4 = 2N+1 states. At non-zero t, we can consider it as a perturbation. Albeit this term may break symme- tries, it is not able to break the ground state degeneracy until the L-th order in perturba- tion theory. The perturbation term ∼ −tXℓ acts on the link ℓ and ﬂips its spin. In order to the perturbation lead a ground state (3.13) into another it must be able to invert a whole line of spins. If the linear size of the system is L, then it only happens at L-th order. In the thermodynamic limit L → ∞ the energy splitting between the states (3.13) ∆E ∼ g (t/g)L vanishes. Actually, the four-fold degeneracy is robust against any local perturbation and is the most important feature of the Z2 gauge theory. • g ≪ t: This phase consists of a non-aligned phase. The eigenstates of the Xℓ operator with positive eigenvalue is |⇒ℓ⟩ and, for g = 0, the ground state of the system is simply ∏ℓ ⊗ |⇒ℓ⟩. It is not hard to see that the gauge structure is now trivial: every gauge trans- formation (3.2) maps any state in H into itself (modulo a global phase). Thus, trivially Hphys ∼= H and dim Hphys = 22N. We can successfully use the 22N eigenvalues of the operators Xℓ to completely label the physical states. The energy of the ground state is E0 = −2Nt and the gap to the ﬁrst excited state is ∆E ∼ 2t, which does not go to zero, for large t, even in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to the topological phase, in this phase, the excitations can be individually created by a local application of the Zℓ operator and the ground state is no longer degenerate. We call this phase the trivial phase. Thus, to summarize, in the g ≫ t phase, the ground state is degenerated and has Z2 visions as low-energy excitations. We call this phase the Z2 deconﬁned phase. In the g ≪ t, the ground state is non-degenerated and the low-energy excitations are just qubits oriented against the ﬁeld t. We call this phase the Z2 conﬁned phase by the simply fact that the visions do not appear in the spectrum. Effective Field Theory Based on the work in Ref. [23] we are able to ﬁnd an effective ﬁeld theory which captures the phenomenology present in the Z2 lattice gauge model (3.1). In order to get a continuum theory, we embed the discrete Z2 gauge structure into a continuous U(1) group. Let us introduce U(1)- compact gauge ﬁelds Ai,α situated at the link ℓ = (i, i + ˆeα) between the sites i and i + ˆeα with α = 1, 2. The discrete and continuum degrees of freedom are related by [23] Zix → exp (iηi Aix) and Ziy → exp (−iηi Aiy) , with ηi = (−1)ix+iy. (3.16) 14 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories In general, the effective U(1) gauge theory posses distinct UV physical properties than the original Z2 model. We expect, however, that both theories describe the same physics not in all energy scales but only in the infrared limit. Based on this argument, a potential term ∼ −L cos(2Aiα) is added in the Hamiltonian in an ad hoc way so that the conﬁgurations Aiα = 0, π are favored in the large L limit. In order to replicate the Pauli operators anti-commutation algebra, we introduce conjugated “electric ﬁelds” Eiα [Aiα, Ejβ] = iδijδαβ, (3.17) with the identiﬁcation Xiα → exp (πiηiEiα) . (3.18) Since Aiα is a periodic variable, Eiα has integer eigenvalues. The Hamiltonian, in terms of the U(1) ﬁeld is HU(1) = −K ∑ □ cos (ϵαβ∆α Aiβ) + h ∑ i,α E2 iα − L ∑ iα cos (2Aiα) , (3.19) where ∆α fi ≡ fi+ ˆeα − fi. The ﬁrst term in (3.19) follows from the plaquette terms and the second one were added to provide dynamics to the ﬁelds. It is worth to mention that the Gauss law is ∆αEiα = 0 is compatible with our matter-free theory Gi = +1. Although we have been referring to A as an U(1) gauge ﬁeld, the third term in (3.19) is not invariant under gauge transformations Ai,α → Ai,α + ∆α fi. In favor to grant it gauge invariance, we use the Stueckelberg trick, i.e., we promote the gauge parameter to a dynamical ﬁeld which transforms appropriately under local transformations. It corresponds to introduce a matter ﬁeld Θi, with the corresponding conjugated momenta ˆNi, and to couple it to the gauge ﬁeld HU(1) = −K ∑ □ cos (ϵαβ∆α Aiβ) + h ∑ i,α E2 iα − L ∑ iα cos (∆αΘi − 2Aiα) + ̃h ∑ i ˆN2 i , (3.20) with [Θi, ˆNj] = iδij. In this fashion HU(1) is invariant under gauge transformations Aiα → Aiα + ∆α fi, Θi → Θi + 2 fi. We see that The ﬁeld Hi ≡ exp(iΘi) possesses charge 2 under the gauge group U(1). We now take the continuum limit of the Hamiltonian (3.20), which describes gapped matter coupled to an U(1) compact gauge ﬁeld. The U(1) group topology causes the proliferation of monopole instanton solutions throughout the system, making even the symmetric phase completely gapped [24]. In the continuum limit of (3.20), the monopoles degrees of freedom Φ are taken into account by an external Lagrangian Lmon(Φ) so that the continuum Lagrangian is given by LU(1) = LH + Lmon , with LH = ∣ ∣(∂µ − 2iAµ) H∣ ∣2 + g|H|2 + u|H|4 + K (ϵµνλ∂ν Aλ)2 , (3.21) where the new parameters are functions of the old ones. The continuum gauge transformation of the ﬁelds, by its turn, reads Aµ → Aµ + ∂µ f and H → Hei2 f . 3.1. Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory 15 The two phases of (3.21) correspond to the two phases of (3.1), which can be accessed by tuning the g parameter below or above the critical value gc. For g > gc, in which ⟨H|H⟩ = 0, the matter ﬁeld H decouples and the monopoles proliferate ⟨Φ|Φ⟩ ̸= 0, giving rise to a conﬁning gapped phase. There is no topological order and it corresponds to the conﬁning phase of (3.1). For g < gc, ⟨H|H⟩ ≡ H0 ̸= 0 is responsible for the Higgs mechanism which gives the U(1) gauge ﬁelds a mass. This is a deconﬁned phase, where the monopoles are not condensed ⟨Φ|Φ⟩ = 0. Although the amplitude degree of freedom H0 is frozen, there are nontrivial topo- logical excitations associated with Higgs ﬁeld phase. As H goes q times around a vortex it gains a phase of 2πq at the time that a gauge ﬂux of ∫ d2x (∂1 A2 − ∂2 A1) = πq (3.22) is trapped in the vortex core [25]. Such point-like defects have ﬁnite energy and correspond to the Z2 visions in the lattice model. Because of the presence of the monopoles source term the trapped ﬂux is only deﬁned modulo 2π implying that q is only deﬁned mod 2, precisely as Z2 visions require. Finally, we can argue that in the Higgs phase, the EFT for the Z2 lattice model is a BF theory. We note that the Higgs phase of (3.21) can be dualized to a topological theory. To see it, let us consider a Higgs ﬁeld with charge p under the U(1) gauge ﬁeld a D ˜φ = (∂ − ipa) ˜φ. (3.23) In the Higgs phase the radial mode of the ﬁeld is frozen and we focus on the dynamics of the phase degree of freedom ˜φ = meiφ, dictated by m2(∂µφ − paµ)(∂µφ − paµ) + 1 4e2 f 2 a . (3.24) In the strict low-energy limit m → ∞ all local degrees of freedom are swept away since the aµ ﬁeld becomes pure gauge aµ = 1 p ∂µφ. In fact, the low-energy physics is determined by global degrees of freedom which depends on the underlying manifold topology. In order to understand this point, we shall manipulate the Lagrangian to make it explicit. First, we dualize the scalar ﬁeld φ to a new gauge ﬁeld b ∂µφ ≡ bµ. (3.25) The scalar-gauge duality is accompanied by the pure gauge constraint ϵµνρ∂νbρ = 0, (3.26) which can be enforced through Lagrange multipliers cµ. In this fashion, the Lagrangian (3.24) is equivalently written as m2(bµ − paµ)(bµ − paµ) + 1 2π ϵµνρcµ∂νbρ + 1 4e2 f 2 a . (3.27) Now we shift the ﬁeld bµ → bµ + paµ m2b2 + 1 2π ϵµνρcµ∂νbρ + p 2π ϵµνρcµ∂νaρ + 1 4e2 f 2 a , (3.28) 16 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories and integrate it out 1 2(4π)2m2 f 2 c + p 2π ϵµνρcµ∂νaρ + 1 4e2 f 2 a . (3.29) It is now explicit that, in the deep infrared m, e2 → ∞, the long-distance physics is dominated by BF topological ﬁeld theory p 2π ϵµνρcµ∂νaρ. (3.30) Thus, we see that the EFT for the Higgs phase of the Z2 gauge lattice model corresponds to the BF theory with quantized level p = 2. For a generalized ZN gauge lattice model, it would correspond to p = N. By the analysis in Section 2.1 we see that it correctly captures the N2 ground state degeneracy of a generalized ZN lattice gauge theory. The usage of ad hoc arguments and the dual photon duality obscures the precise relation between the lattice and the BF continuum degrees of freedom. As an alternative, in the next section we propose to use a map, as in Ref. [18], to explicitly ﬁnd the BF theory from the lattice in a more direct way. 3.2 Toric Code In contrast to the Z2 gauge lattice model, which we could only solve for some regime in the space of parameters, the toric code is an exactly solvable model. Indeed, the toric code can be thought as the topological phase of the Z2 gauge model, with the addition of star interacting terms. As we will investigate, there are two kinds of excitations in this model, which carry nontrivial mutual statistics. Here we follow the discussion in [26] and [8]. The Toric Code is a two-dimensional model proposed by Kitaev [26], with a two-dimensional Hilbert space in each link of a square lattice given by the following Hamiltonian HTC = −Je ∑ i Ai − Jm ∑ p Bp, Je, Jm > 0, (3.31) with the sum over plaquettes p and lattice vertices i. In the above expression, the star operator Ai = ∏ ℓ⋉i Xℓ, (3.32) is the product of the X Pauli operators on the four links ℓ connected to the site i. The plaquette operator Bp = ∏ ℓ∈∂p Zℓ, (3.33) is a product of the Z Pauli operator on the boundary ∂p of a plaquette p. All the operators As and Bp commutes among themselves for every sites and plaquettes [Ai, Aj] = [Bp, Bp′ ] = [Ai, Bp] = 0. (3.34) The two ﬁrst commutators vanish since they involve only one “ﬂavor” of Pauli operators (X for the star and Z for the plaquette operators) and they trivially commute among themselves. The last commutator vanishes trivially for the cases in which Ai and Bp do not share any link. For the case in which the site i relies on a corner of the plaquette p, they share two links and 3.2. Toric Code 17 their commutation follows from the algebra: [Ai, Bp] = X1X2Z5Z6[X3X4, Z3Z4] (3.35) = X1X2Z5Z6  X3Z3 {X4, Z4} ︸ ︷︷ ︸ 0 − {X3, Z3} ︸ ︷︷ ︸ 0 Z4X4   (3.36) = 0, (3.37) with the links 3 and 4 being the two common shared links. Since all the operators are compatible we can ﬁnd the ground state exactly. The ground state are characterized by positive eigenvalues of Ai and Bp for every site and plaquette of the lattice. Let {sℓ} be the set of eigenvalues at the links ℓ in a given spin conﬁguration and Bp(s) = ∏ℓ∈∂p sℓ a measure of the plaquettes eigenvalues. If Bp(s) = −1, we say there is a vortex on the plaquette p in the spin conﬁguration {sℓ}. Let |↑↑ . . .⟩ = ∏ℓ ⊗ |↑⟩ℓ, with Zℓ |↑⟩ℓ = +1 |↑⟩ℓ and let Pi ≡ (1 + Ai) 2 (3.38) be the star projector in the lattice vertex i. Then, the ground state of this model is explicitly given by |0⟩ = ∏ i Pi |↑↑ . . .⟩ . (3.39) This is, indeed, the ground state of the Hamiltonian since Ai |0⟩ = |0⟩ and Bp |0⟩ = |0⟩ for every vertex i and plaquette p, namely Ai |0⟩ = Ai ∏ j Pj |↑↑ . . .⟩ = AiPi︸︷︷︸ Pi ∏ j̸=i Pj |↑↑ . . .⟩ (3.40) = ∏ j Pj |↑↑ . . .⟩ = |0⟩ ∀i, where we have used the fact that AiPi = Ai (1 + Ai) /2 = (Ai + 1) /2 = Pi. In addition, Bp |0⟩ = Bp ∏ i Pi |↑↑ . . .⟩ (3.41) = ∏ i Pi Bp |↑↑ . . .⟩ ︸ ︷︷ ︸ +1|↑↑...⟩ = |0⟩ , ∀p. (3.42) Since Xℓ |↑⟩ℓ = |↓⟩ℓ and the star operator involves a product of X operators, the action of Ai on the product state |↑↑ . . .⟩ is to ﬂip the up spins pf the four links connected to the site i. The product of projector Pi on all the vertices i will ﬂip spins in such way that (3.40) and (3.41) are satisﬁed. In order to have Bp(s) = +1 everywhere, there must be an even number of ﬂipped spins connected to each lattice vertex i, which is geometrically achieved by ﬂipped spins along closed loops. At the same time, in order to have Ai(s) = +1 everywhere, |0⟩ must be a superposition of all such closed loop states. This is necessary since, at every measure of the star operator Ai |0⟩, we ﬂip all the spins connected to i (spins up goes to spins down and vice-versa) and because (3.40) we still need to recover the original state. This state is highly entangled and is an example of a string-net condensate [27]. 18 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories In a loop conﬁguration basis, we can write the ground state as a superposition of spin con- ﬁgurations {s} such that it contains no vortices: |0⟩ = ∑ {s:wp(s)=1∀ p} cs |s⟩ . (3.43) As previously argued, the application of the star operator Ai in this state maps a loop con- ﬁguration |s⟩ into another one, mapping the state |0⟩ into itself, which tell us that all the cs are of equal weight. If the lattice is deﬁned in a plane, the previous discussions are enough to com- pletely determine the ground state of the system. However, this does not hold if the system is deﬁned in nontrivial topological spaces. Let us impose periodic boundary conditions, or equivalently, deﬁne our lattice on a torus. There are more than one ground state. In fact, in a g = 1 genus topological space, the ground state is four-fold degenerate. We can vizualize this degeneracy through the introduction of the Wilson loop variables wγ(s) = ∏ ℓ∈γ sℓ, γ = γ1, γ2, (3.44) with γ1 and γ2 two non-contractible loops wrapping the torus. As in the case of the Z2 gauge lattice model, the presence of these global excitations keep the energy of these states the same since they do not create local excitations Bp = −1 nor As = −1. In this way, we have four different ground states: ∣ ∣ ∣0ωγ1 ωγ2 〉 = ∑ {s:Bp(s)=1∀ p} cωγ1 ωγ2 |s⟩ (3.45) Let us now study the excitations of this model. Excitations corresponding to the star oper- ators that are characterized by Ai(s) = −1 in the vertex i and are pairwise created above the ground state at the endpoints i1 and i2 of the string operator W(e) γ = ∏ ℓ∈γ Zℓ. (3.46) We call each Ai(s) = −1 excitation an “electric” particle e, which correspond to the state |i1, i2⟩ = W(e) γ |0⟩ . (3.47) The energetic cost to create a single e particle is 2Je. Analogously, we call the vortex excitations Bp(s) = −1 magnetic particles m. The energetic cost to create a single m particle above the ground state is 2Jm and they are created in the plaquette endpoints of the dual lattice string W(m) γ∗ = ∏ ℓ∈γ∗ Xℓ. (3.48) If the endpoints of γ∗ are located at the plaquettes p1 and p2, the quantum state corresponding to the pair of m excitations created above the ground state is given by |p1, p2⟩ = W(m) γ∗ |0⟩ . (3.49) 3.2. Toric Code 19 So far we know that the excitation spectrum corresponds to well localized excitations of the type e or m which carry Z2 charge. To fully characterize them, it is natural to ask about the particle statistics. Let us consider the braiding operator Rab which exchanges the particles a and b. FIGURE 3.4: The braiding operator. Source: [28] FIGURE 3.5: Two exchanges. Source: [28] When the two particles are distinguishable, Rab give us the sense of mutual statistics. Let us consider an initial state |ψinit⟩ which contains both an electric and a magnetic excitations. Let us move the e particle around the m particle around a closed loop L |ψﬁn⟩ = ∏ ℓ∈L Zℓ |ψinit⟩ . (3.50) Using the Stoke’s theorem ∏ ℓ∈L Zℓ = ∏ p∈A Bp, (3.51) with A being the area contained in L = ∂A. Then, since we have a m particle Bp = −1 inside L |ψﬁn⟩ = − |ψinit⟩ , (3.52) which indicates us a nontrivial statistics. The process is graphically represented in Figure 3.6. FIGURE 3.6: Braiding of e and m particles. Source: [28] Doing the same procedure, we ﬁnd that the e and m particles are bosons (Figure 3.7). 20 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories FIGURE 3.7: The electric and magnetic excitations are bosons. Source: [28] Not all the excitations in this model are bosons. The nontrivial mutual statistics allow us to construct, however, a composite particle which has nontrivial statistics. Consider the bound state ϵ = e × m. As it is graphically represented in Figure 3.8, the ϵ particle is a fermion. FIGURE 3.8: The composite excitation ϵ is a fermion. Source: [28] To summarize, the fusion rules of the toric code excitations are e × e = 1 e × m = ϵ (3.53) m × m = 1 e × ϵ = m (3.54) ϵ × ϵ = 1 m × ϵ = e. (3.55) The action of the Pauli operators on any one of the ground states is to create excited states, which are orthogonal to |0⟩. In this fashion, we see that in fact the states are not magnetically ordered ⟨0| Zℓ |0⟩ = 0 and ⟨0| Xℓ |0⟩ = 0. (3.56) Such property plays an important role in quantum spin liquids. If we allow perturbations on the original Hamiltonian (3.31) H = HTC − hz ∑ ℓ Zℓ − hx ∑ ℓ Xℓ (3.57) we see that they have no crucial role in lifting the ground state degeneracy ⟨H⟩ = ⟨HTC⟩ − ⟨hz ∑ℓ Zℓ + hx ∑ℓ Xℓ⟩ = ⟨HTc⟩. This is just a consequence of the robust topological character of the ground state degeneracy. In fact, for an L × L periodic square lattice, only perturbations in L−th order in hz and hx would be enough to connect two distinct ground states. The ground state (3.43) is an example of a string-net condensate state. Such states with non-local excitations naturally leads to topological phases of matter [27]. In the section 5.1 we will see that the ground state of the X-Cube model, when constructed from two-dimensional Toric Code layers, corresponds to a condensate of strings. In such states, fermions and bosons may emerge in the system, associated to the endpoints of the strings. Wen proposed such mechanism as a way to unify bosons and fermions [4]. 3.2. Toric Code 21 Generalization to the ZN case Generalization to the ZN case is possible through the introduction of the ZN Pauli operators (See Appendix A). As argued in [29], the ZN Toric code can be thought as the ZN lattice gauge model in the presence of charged matter. In this fashion, the Toric Code EFT is also given by a continuum BF topological theory. It is deﬁned on a square lattice with the Hamiltonian given by HTC = −Jm ∑ p Bp − Je ∑ i Ai + h.c., Je, Jm > 0 (3.58) with the sum on plaquettes p and lattice vertices i. In the above expression, the star and pla- quette operators are written in terms of the ZN Pauli operators Ai = ∏ ℓ⋉i Xℓ, Bp = ∏ ℓ∈∂p Zℓ. (3.59) The ZN degrees of freedom located at the links have a sense of orientation, more speciﬁc, X−ℓ = X† ℓ where −ℓ refers to the inverted orientation of the link ℓ. In 3.59 the star operators are deﬁned so that all links point towards i and the plaquette operators are deﬁned so that the links are oriented in the anti-clockwise orientation. Analogously to the N = 2 case, in the ZN Toric Code all operators commute so that the ground state for HTC can be explicitly found. If the lattice is equipped with periodic boundary conditions we ﬁnd that the ground state is not unique, but is N2-fold degenerated. It holds for any values of Je > 0 and Jm > 0. The system is completely gapped and excitations above the ground state are created at the endpoints of the open line operators W(γ) = ∏ ℓ∈γ Zℓ and V(γ∗) = ∏ ℓ∩γ∗ Xℓ, (3.60) where γ and γ∗ are strings on the lattice dual lattice, respectively. The excitations created by W(γ) are commonly called electric particles or charges (e particles) and the ones associated to V(γ∗) are called magnetic particles or vortices (m-particles). Electric excitations are localized at site i and magnetic at plaquette p and correspond to eigenvalues of the operators ˜Ai ≡ Ai + A† i and ˜Bp ≡ Bp + B† p, ˜Ai |ψ⟩ = 2 cos (2π/N) |ψ⟩ and ˜Bp |ψ⟩ = 2 cos (2π/N) |ψ⟩ . (3.61) Such excitations have an energetic cost of 4Je/m cos (2π/N). Excitations with “charge” q and “vorticity” n, both quantities deﬁned mod N, can be created at the endpoints of higher order string operators W(γ)q |0⟩ and V(γ∗)n |0⟩. In this fashion, ˜Ai |ψ⟩ = 2 cos(2πq/N) |ψ⟩ and ˜Bp |ψ⟩ = 2 cos(2πn/N) |ψ⟩. There are other operators that commute with the Hamiltonian and can be used to characterize excitations. In contrast to the operators ˜Ai and ˜Bp, the Hermitian operators ¯Ai = i (Ai − A† i ) and ¯Bp (similarly deﬁned) are able to distinct between excitations and anti-excitations. They obey ¯AiZℓ |0⟩ = a Zℓ |0⟩ and ¯AiZ† ℓ |0⟩ = −a Z† ℓ |0⟩ (3.62) with a ≡ 2 sin (2π/N). Although the elementary excitations e and m are bosons, they have nontrivial mutual statis- tics. When we move an electric excitation with charge q around a magnetic excitation with 22 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories vorticity n, the wavefunction acquires a nontrivial phase ∣ ∣ψ f 〉 = ωqn |ψi⟩ . (3.63) For the case of the usual toric code model, N = 2, this gives (−1)qn, showing that the composite excitation with q = n = 1 is a fermion. The Toric code is invariant under both time-reversal T (see Appendix A) T : X ↦→ ω∗X and T : Z ↦→ ω∗Z† (3.64) and charge conjugation C : X ↦→ X† and C : Z ↦→ Z†. (3.65) The C transformation is a charge conjugation operation in the sense that it maps the ZN Toric code e and m excitations into their ZN antiparticles. The action C : W(γ) ↦→ W(γ)† = W(−γ) and C : V(γ∗) ↦→ V(γ∗)† = V(−γ∗) has precisely the effect of exchanging particles and anti- particles (and vortices and anti-vortices) a ↔ −a. Effective Field Theory Now we shall derive the low-energy effective ﬁeld theory for the ZN toric code model by following the method developed in [18]. The basic idea is to represent the spin operators in terms of ﬁelds that are well-deﬁned in the continuum limit, namely, Xℓ ≡ exp (it(1)KA (ℓ)) (3.66) and Zℓ ≡ exp (it(2)KA (ℓ)) . (3.67) In this representation, K is a 2 × 2 anti-symmetric matrix K = ( 0 k −k 0 ) and K−1 = ( 0 − 1 k 1 k 0 ) , (3.68) where the precise value of k will be ﬁxed by demanding that these operators satisﬁes the ZN algebra (A.1). The vectors t’s are chosen as t(1) = (1, 0) and t(2) = (0, 1) (3.69) and A(ℓ) corresponds to the column vector A(ℓ) = ( A1(ℓ) A2(ℓ) ) , (3.70) with the components satisfying the nontrivial commutation relation [Aa(l), Ab(l′)] ≡ −2πi(K−1)abδl,l′. (3.71) By writing explicitly the operators (3.66) and (3.67), Xℓ = exp (ikA2(ℓ)) and Zℓ = exp (−ikA1(ℓ)) , (3.72) 3.2. Toric Code 23 we see that in order to reproduce the ZN algebra (A.1), we set k ≡ 1 N . (3.73) Now we are ready to derive the low-energy effective ﬁeld theory. Let us specify a link as ℓ ≡ (i, α), i.e., with its origin at the site i and with α indicating the corresponding direction and orientation, α = ±1, ±2. In this way, it is convenient to encode the information of different directions in terms of independent ﬁelds, namely, A1 (i, 1) ⇔ b1 (i + ˆe1 2 ) , A1 (i, 2) ⇔ b2 (i + ˆe2 2 ) , A2 (i, 1) ⇔ a2 (i + ˆe1 2 ) , A2 (i, 2) ⇔ −a1 (i + ˆe2 2 ) . (3.74) The new ﬁelds ai and bi are located at the links. In terms of these ﬁelds, the commutation relation (3.71) splits in [a1(i + ˆe2 2 ), b2(j + ˆe2 2 )] = 2πiNδij (3.75) and [a2(i + ˆe1 2 ), b1(j + ˆe1 2 )] = −2πiNδij. (3.76) According to the identiﬁcations in (3.74), the star and plaquette operators read Ai = exp [i 1 N (a2(i + ˆe1 2 ) − a2(i − ˆe1 2 ) − a1(i + ˆe2 2 ) + a1(i − ˆe2 2 ))] (3.77) and Bp = exp [−i 1 N (b1(i + ˆe1 2 ) + b2(i + ˆe1 + ˆe2 2 ) − b1(i + ˆe1 2 + ˆe2) − b2(i + ˆe2 2 ))] . (3.78) In the continuum limit, they reduce to Ai ∼ exp [i 1 N (∂1a2 − ∂2a1)] (3.79) and Bp ∼ exp [−i 1 N (∂1b2 − ∂2b1)] . (3.80) Consequently, the continuum limit of the Hamiltonian (3.58) is H ∼ −Je ∫ d2x cos [ 1 N (∂1a2 − ∂2a1)] − Jm ∫ d2x cos [ 1 N (∂1b2 − ∂2b1)] . (3.81) Now it is immediate to construct an effective action describing its low-energy properties. The ground state corresponds to the case where all the cosines are maximized. This can be imple- mented in the action through Lagrange multipliers. We can write the effective action describing 24 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories the low-energy properties of the toric code as Se f f = − ∫ dtd2x 1 2πN [b1∂0a2 − b2∂0a1 − b0 (∂1a2 − ∂2a1) − a0 (∂1b2 − ∂2b1)] . (3.82) The ﬁrst two terms of this action imply the commutation relations (3.75) and (3.76), whereas the remaining ones correspond to the ground state constraints, implemented via the Lagrange multipliers a0 and b0. The theory (3.82) is nothing else but the BF action S = ∫ T2×R d3x 1 2πN ϵµνρaµ∂νbρ. (3.83) We can bring this to a more conventional normalization by rescaling the ﬁelds aµ → Naµ and bµ → Nbµ. With this, the action becomes S = ∫ T2×R d3x N 2π ϵµνρaµ∂νbρ, (3.84) together with the commutation relations properly rescaled, [a1(⃗x), b2(⃗x′)] = 2πi N δ(⃗x − ⃗x′) (3.85) and [a2(⃗x), b1(⃗x′)] = − 2πi N δ(⃗x − ⃗x′). (3.86) This leads correctly to a N2-fold ground state degeneracy. Let us examine how the discrete symmetries T and C act on the ﬁelds of the continuum theory. This can be extracted from the corresponding transformations of the spin operators, translating them to the ﬁelds according to (3.72). Under time-reversal T , the ﬁelds transform as a0 → a′ 0 = −a0 b0 → b′ 0 = b0 a1 → a′ 1 = a1 − 2π l b1 → b′ 1 = −b1 + 2π l a2 → a′ 2 = a2 − 2π l b2 → b′ 2 = −b2 + 2π l , (3.87) where l is the lattice spacing. Under charge conjugation C, the ﬁelds transform as a0 → −a0 b0 → −b0 ai → −ai bi → −bi. (3.88) It is immediate to check that these transformations leave the action (3.84) invariant. It is also interesting to consider the theory coupled with external currents. Coming from the lattice, there is a clear identiﬁcation of particle and vortex currents. The ﬁelds a are associated with the star operator (3.79) and then can be coupled with a particle current ja. On the other hand, the ﬁelds b are associated with the plaquette operator (3.80) and a can be coupled with a vortex current jb. The gauge invariant coupling ∫ a · ja + b · jb imply the following transformations of the currents T : {(ja 0, ja i ) ↦→ (−ja 0, ja i ), (jb 0, jb i ) ↦→ (jb 0, −jb i ), and C : {(ja 0, ja i ) ↦→ (−ja 0, −ja i ), (jb 0, jb i ) ↦→ (−jb 0, −jb i ), (3.89) 3.3. Wen Plaquette Model 25 which are the expected transformations for particle and vortex currents [30]. We shall see now how the line operators of the continuum theory follow immediately from the map (3.72). Consider the closed Wilson lines of electric type W(γ) ≡ ∏ ℓ∈γ Zℓ, γ = γ1, γ2, (3.90) where γ1 and γ2 are lines that wrap around the torus in the directions x1 and x2. Mapping them into their continuum version we have that, in the x1 direction W(γ1) = exp ( − ∑ i∈γ1 iA1(i + ˆe1 2 ) ) = exp ( −i ∑ ℓ∈γ1 b1(ℓ) ) ∼ exp (−i ∫ ⃗x+N1 ˆe1 ⃗x dx1b1(x)) = exp (−i ∮ γ1 dx1b1(x)) , (3.91) where we have used that there are N1 sites in the x1 direction and ⃗x ∼ ⃗x + N1 ˆe1 are the same geometrical point. In the same way, for the curve γ2, we obtain W(γ2) = exp (−i ∮ γ2 dx2b2(x)) . (3.92) Proceeding similarly for the magnetic operator, it follows that V(γ∗) = exp (−i ∮ γ dxiai ) . (3.93) The algebra V(γ∗ 1 )W(γ2) = e 2πi N W(γ2)V(γ∗ 1 ), V(γ∗ 2 )W(γ1) = e 2πi N W(γ1)V(γ∗ 2 ), (3.94) following from (3.75) and (3.76) ensures the N2-fold ground state degeneracy, as discussed in the Chapter 2. One further check we can do in the EFT is to study the mutual statistics of excitations. In the presence of vortex with vorticity n located at ⃗x0, jb 0 = nδ(2)(⃗x − ⃗x0), the ﬂux constraint associated with b0 is N 2π ϵij∂iaj = nδ(2)(⃗x − ⃗x0). (3.95) In this way, as we move a q-charged electric excitation around a closed path C that includes ⃗x0, the wavefunction acquires an Aharonov-Bhom phase exp{iq ∮ ∂R aidxi} = exp iq ∫ R ϵij∂iajdx1dx2 = exp ( 2πiqn N ) = ωqn. (3.96) This result is precisely the mutual statistics we have found in (3.63). 3.3 Wen Plaquette Model We study now the ZN version of the Wen plaquette (WP) model [31]. It is deﬁned on a two-dimensional periodic square lattice with ZN degrees of freedom lying on the sites, with the Hamiltonian written in terms of commuting projectors. Hence, we can proceed similarly to 26 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories the previous case in order to derive the low-energy effective theory. The Hamiltonian reads HWP = − 1 2 ∑ i gi ( ˆFi + ˆF† i ) , (3.97) where ˆFi ≡ XiZi+ ˆe1 X† i+ ˆe1+ ˆe2 Z† i+ ˆe2 (3.98) and all gi > 0. This model is also exactly solvable due to the simultaneously commutation of all the plaquette operators (commuting projectors), [ ˆFi, ˆFj] = 0 and [ ˆFi, ˆF† j ] = 0, (3.99) which lead to a gapped topologically ordered system. As the low-energy physics depends whether the number of sites of the lattice along each direction is even or odd, we shall study the three cases separately. 3.3.1 Even × Even Lattice Let us ﬁrstly consider an even by even lattice, where all the sites have a well deﬁned parity. We divide the plaquette operators in the Hamiltonian in odd and even sites HWP = − 1 2 ( g1 ∑ i∈Λeven ˆFi + g2 ∑ i∈Λodd ˆFi ) + h. c., (3.100) where i belongs to the even sub-lattice Λeven if ix + iy is even and to the odd sub-lattice Λodd if ix + iy is odd. We also refer to the plaquette operators ˆFi themselves as even or odd according to the parity of the corresponding site i. Similarly, we call a given plaquette even (even) if its inferior leftmost site is even (odd), as shown in Figure 3.9. FIGURE 3.9: We call a given plaquette even if i ∈ Λeven and odd if i ∈ Λodd. For the N ̸= 2 the Hamiltonians (3.97) and (3.100) are not invariant under time-reversal as deﬁned in the Toric code model (3.64). The plaquette operators transform as T : ˆFi → ˆF′ i = XiZ† i+e1 X† i+e1+e2 Zi+e2, and then cannot be mapped into ˆFi nor ˆF† i . However, as discussed in [32], in the case of an even × even square lattice, the ZN WP model is remarkably equivalent to the Toric code. This means that the time-reversal symmetry of the Toric code must corresponds to a different discrete symmetry in the WP model. Indeed, in addition to the charge conjugation deﬁned in (3.65), the Hamiltonian (3.100) is also invariant under T ′ : {X ↦→ ω∗X and Z ↦→ ω∗Z, for X and Z belonging to even plaquettes, X ↦→ ω∗X† and Z ↦→ ω∗Z†, for X and Z belonging to odd plaquettes. (3.101) 3.3. Wen Plaquette Model 27 The T ′ symmetry can be thought as a charge conjugation operation, but only for one type of excitations (the odd plaquettes). We will see that it is precisely the Toric code T symmetry analogue. On an even × even lattice, the WP model contains two types of non-contractible string operators that play the same role as W(γ) and V(γ∗) in the Toric code. Let the paths γ and γ∗ lie on the even and odd plaquettes, respectively. We deﬁne the Wilson operators on even plaquettes (Figure 3.10) W(γ) = ∏ i∈γ Pi, with Pi = {Zi, i ∈ Λeven, Xi, i ∈ Λodd, (3.102) and, in a similar way, the ’t Hooft loop operators on odd plaquettes (Figure 3.11) V(γ∗) = ∏ i∈γ∗ Pi, with Pi = {Xi, i ∈ Λeven, Zi, i ∈ Λodd. (3.103) Let ηi = ix + iy the parity of the site i in which the corresponding two line operators intersect. FIGURE 3.10: Wilson line operators crossing the system in the horizontal direc- tion on the even (white) plaquettes. It is an alternating product of Z (blue dots) or X (red dots) depending if the site is even or odd. FIGURE 3.11: t’Hooft line operators crossing the system in the horizontal direc- tion on the odd (black) plaquettes. It is an alternating product of Z (blue dots) or X (red dots) depending if the site is odd or even. 28 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories They satisfy W(γx)V(γ∗ y) = e 2πi N (−)ηi V(γ∗ y)W(γx) and W(γy)V(γ∗ x) = e 2πi N (−)ηi V(γ∗ x)W(γy), (3.104) which leads to a N2-fold ground state degeneracy. Excitations created above the ground state are described by open line operators. The excitations, corresponding to even and odd pla- quettes, are created at the endpoints of W and V strings and are analogous to the electric and magnetic particles of the Toric code, respectively. In order to ﬁnd the EFT for the even × even WP model, we map the even and odd degrees of freedom into ﬁelds A and B as X = eiA1 and Z = e−iA2 for even plaquettes, X = eiB1 and Z = e−iB2 for odd plaquettes. (3.105) These are precisely the maps (3.72) up to a rescaling of the ﬁelds by a factor of N. Nontrivial commutation rules occur only between even and odd plaquette operators. This is translated in nontrivial commutation relation between A and B ﬁelds [Aa(⃗x), Bb(⃗y)] = ϵab 2iπ N δ⃗x,⃗y. (3.106) In terms of the ﬁelds (3.105), the even plaquette operators are represented as ˆFi∈Λeven = exp i [A2 (i) − A1 (i + ˆe1) − A2 (i + ˆe1 + ˆe2) + A1 (i + ˆe2)] (3.107) and the odd plaquette operators as ˆFi∈Λodd = exp i [B2 (i) − B1 (i + ˆe1) − B2 (i + ˆe1 + ˆe2) + B1 (i + ˆe2)] . (3.108) In the continuum limit, they become ˆFi∈Λeven ∼ exp i [−∂1 A2 − ∂2 A2 − ∂1 A1 + ∂2 A1] ∼ exp i√2 [∂l1 A2 − ∂l2 A1] (3.109) and Fi∈Λodd ∼ exp i√2 [−∂1B1 − ∂1B2 − ∂2B2 + ∂2B1] ∼ exp i√2 [∂l1 B2 − ∂l2 B1] , (3.110) where we have deﬁned the new coordinates ∂l1 ≡ (−∂1 − ∂2) /√2 and ∂l2 ≡ (∂1 − ∂2) /√2. The Hamiltonian becomes H ∼ −g1 ∫ d2l cos [√2(∂l1 A2 − ∂l2 A1)] − g2 ∫ d2l cos [√2(∂l1 B2 − ∂l2 B1)] . (3.111) To obtain the low-energy effective action, we can proceed precisely in the same way as we did in the previous section with the Toric code. We construct an action that reproduces the commutation relations (3.106) as well as the ground state constraints, S = ∫ dtd2l N 2π [−B1∂0 A2 + B2∂0 A1 − B0 (∂l1 A2 − ∂l2 A1) − A0 (∂l1 B2 − ∂l2 B1)] , (3.112) where A0 and B0 are the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the maximization of the cosines in (3.111) (we have absorbed numerical factors in A0 and B0). This action can be compactly 3.3. Wen Plaquette Model 29 written as S = N 2π ∫ d2ldt ϵµνρ Aµ∂νBρ, (3.113) where ∂1 ≡ ∂l1 and ∂2 ≡ ∂l2, which is nothing else a ZN BF topological ﬁeld theory. In the continuum limit the Wilson line operators become W(γ) ∼ exp  −i ∮ γ Aidli   , (3.114) and similarly, the ’t Hooft lines V(γ∗) ∼ exp  −i ∮ γ∗ Bidli   . (3.115) They are exactly the loop operators (2.13) of the BF theory. Under charge conjugation, C : Ai ↦→ −A1 and C : Bi ↦→ −B1. The BF action is invariant under the C ensured that C : A0 ↦→ −A0 and C : B0 ↦→ −B0. (3.116) In addition, T ′ : (A1, A2, B1, B2) ↦→ (A1, A2, −B1, −B2) is a symmetry, ensured that T ′ : (A0, B0, t) ↦→ (−A0, B0, −t), which is precisely the Toric code time-reversal transformation (3.87). As mentioned previously, the WP model deﬁned on an even × even lattice is completely equivalent to the Toric Code [32]. As a reﬂection of this, we have obtained the same low-energy effective theory for both models. The WP model can be mapped into the TC by mapping the clock and shift ZN operators into one another, depending whether they belong to even or odd plaquettes. For even plaquettes, we map Xi → Xi and Zi → Xi. For odd plaquettes, Zi → Zi and X → Z†. Then, schematically Fi with i ∈ Λeven ↔ As, and Fi with i ∈ Λodd ↔ Bp. (3.117) Through this map we see that the WP model is a π 4 -rotated Toric Code, where the sites of the original lattice correspond to the links of the new (Toric code) lattice, as depicted in Figure 3.12. In this way, the T ′ symmetry of the even by even WP model is explicitly mapped into the T symmetry of the Toric code. The equivalence between both models, however, no longer holds in the case that the WP model is deﬁned on an even × odd lattice. 3.3.2 Even × Odd Lattice The low-energy physical properties of the Wen plaquette model is very sensitive to the microscopic details of the lattice. In fact, as discussed in [33], if it is deﬁned on an even × odd lattice it exhibits a different spectrum compared to the previous case (even × even) and the ground state is N-fold degenerate. Due to the periodic boundary conditions, if there is an odd number of sites in the y direction, for example, the parity of the sites is not well-deﬁned in such direction. In this case, it is not possible to split the Hamiltonian into two sub-lattices as in 30 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories FIGURE 3.12: Map between the operators of Wen Plaquette model and the Toric Code. (3.100). With no loss of generality, we set gi = g and write the Hamiltonian (3.97) H = − g 2 ∑ i ( ˆFi + h.c.) . (3.118) Let Nx and Ny be the number of sites along directions x and y, respectively, with Nx even and Ny odd. As we can no longer distinguish among odd and even plaquettes in the y di- rection, we cannot distinguish between “electric” and “magnetic” excitations. Therefore, we generically denote them as p-particles. In this case, there are only two independent holonomies which commute with the Hamiltonian W(γx) = ∏ γx Pi and W(γy) = ∏ γy XiZ† i . (3.119) They satisfy W(γy)W(γx) = e 2πi N W(γx)W(γy). (3.120) In the above relations, W(γx) corresponds to the motion of a p-particle throughout the system around the x direction, whereas W(γy) represents the motion of a pair of p-particles around the y direction. The Figure 3.13 shows both non-contractible operators. Since both W(γx) and W(γy) commute with the Hamiltonian, the algebra (3.120) implies a N-fold degeneracy of the ground state. In contrast to the even × even case, there is no consistent way to introduce two species of ﬁelds A and B. Therefore, we are forced to map all the plaquette operators into a single ﬁeld species Aa: Xi ≡ exp iA2(i) and Zi ≡ exp −iA1(i), (3.121) with the following commutation rule [Aa(⃗x), Ab(⃗y)] = ϵab 2πi N δ⃗x⃗y. (3.122) 3.3. Wen Plaquette Model 31 FIGURE 3.13: Line operators around the system. Application of alternating prod- uct X (red) and Z (blue) along the x direction and application of XZ† (green) op- erators in the vertical direction. Now we can proceed as in the previous case, i.e., we consider the Hamiltonian in the continuum limit and then construct an action for ﬁeld conﬁgurations that minimize the energy and that reproduces the commutation rule (3.122). This leads to the continuum Chern-Simons EFT S = N 4π ∫ d2ldt ϵµνλ Aµ∂lν Aλ. (3.123) The CS action does capture the low-energy properties of the even × odd WP model. Through the map (3.121), one can check that the two lattice holonomies, satisfying (3.120), are mapped into the continuum line operators W(γi) ∼ exp{−i ∮ γi Aidli}. (3.124) Since the sites of the lattice no longer have a well-deﬁned parity in this case, the T ′ transfor- mation (3.101) has no a precise meaning. Only the discrete charge conjugation transformation C remains a symmetry. It can be checked that both the lattice Hamiltonian (3.118) and the con- tinuum action (3.123) are invariant under it. For the case N = 2, the Wen Plaquette model is invariant under the discrete transformation (3.64) T : X ↦→ −X and T : Z ↦→ −Z. (3.125) This is nothing else but the usual time-reversal transformations of 1 2 -spin operators, under which the ﬁelds transform as T : A0 ↦→ −A0 and T : Aa ↦→ Aa − π l . (3.126) Up to total derivative terms, the CS action acquires a global minus signal under T : SCS ↦→ −SCS. We note that the EFT is time-reversal symmetric if both levels N = 2 and N = −2 are identiﬁed, i.e., if we consider only the observables that are not sensitive to the sign of the level. This is also in compliance with the fact that the Pauli algebra XZ = −ZX is reproduced in terms of the ﬁelds independent of the sign of the level, [A1, A2] = ±πi, (3.127) which naturally leads us to identify the Chern-Simons levels N = 2 and N = −2. 32 Chapter 3. Two-dimensional Quantum Spin Liquids Lattice Models and Effective Field Theories 3.3.3 Odd × Odd Lattice As a generalization of the even × odd lattice case, we can deﬁne the line operator Wf = ∏i XiZ† i along vertical and horizontal oriented curves γ1 and γ2. We can also deﬁne line oper- ators Wv along diagonal directions γdi , which cross the whole system until they close to itself, without bending, as illustrated in Figure 3.14. They read [34] Wv = ∏ i Pi, with Pi = {Xi, i ∈ γd1, Zi, i ∈ γd2, (3.128) with γd1 and γd2 the principal and secondary diagonal directions, respectively. The Figure 3.14 represents the principal and secondary diagonals as well as the loops γi along the i = 1 and 2 directions in a square lattice. FIGURE 3.14: Line operators on the square lattice. The Wf operators are deﬁned on γa (blue) curves while Wv are deﬁned on the γdb (red) curves. The curves γd1 and γd2 are referred to as the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively. How many times Wv crosses Wf depends on the lattice size. In fact, for arbitrary odd linear lattice sizes N1 and N2, the line operators Wv(γdb ) cross Wf (γa) a number ρa ≡ lcm(N1, N2)/Na of times, with lcm(p, q) standing for the least common multiple between p and q. In this way, the square lattice with N1 = N2 shown in Figure 3.14 is the simplest case in which the line operators cross only once ρa = 1, for a = 1, 2. In contrast, for the case in which N1 and N2 share no common factor in their prime decomposition lcm(N1, N2) = N1 × N2, we have ρ1 = N2 and ρ2 = N1, i.e., they assume their greatest possible values. The nontrivial algebra between line operators reads Wf (γa)Wv(γdb ) = e 2πiρa N Wv(γdb )Wf (γa). (3.129) The presence of the factor ρ in the algebra does not change the ground state degeneracy. This quantity represents the topological ﬂux inserted on the non-contractible loops and is deﬁned mod N. In this way, the ground state is N-fold degenerate and ρ is the size of the step in which we go through the ZN group. One may be concerned that, if we have, for example, the Z4 group and we adjust the size of the lattice so that ρ1 = 2 and ρ2 = 4, the sets of ground states {1} = {|0⟩ , |2⟩} and {2} = {|1⟩ , |3⟩} would be inaccessible to each other. In another words, there would be no operators able to take states from {2} into {1} and vice-versa. The Figure 3.15 shows the possible ways to run through the Z4 group in steps of 2. 3.3. Wen Plaquette Model 33 FIGURE 3.15: Going through the Z4 group in steps of two would make some states inaccessible. If we start in the states |0⟩ or |2⟩ we could never reach the states |1⟩ and |3⟩. The fact is that it is always possible to access every elements of ZN through applications of Wv(γ1) and Wv(γ2) operators and the example given above can never happen. One can intuitively understand this result by noting that the problematic cases happen when ρ1 ̸= 1 and ρ2 ̸= 1 are multiple of each other. In these cases, it may happen that one cannot reach all states in the ground state space (as in the previous example). However, from the deﬁnition of the ρ factors, ρ1 and ρ2 can never be integer multiples of one another. It roughly tell us that there will always be operators able to map into all states of the ground state space. As the continuum limit is taken, the microscopic details are forgotten and only the low- energy properties survive. The effective ﬁeld theory is given by the Chern-Simons-like theory (3.123) and the relevant degrees of freedom are the line operators (3.124). To summarize, we have obtained EFTs for the Wen Plaquette model in the even × even, even × odd, and odd × odd lattices. The results are in agreement with the proposed EFTs in [35], where the even × even lattice corresponds to a BF theory and the other two cases correspond to CS theories. 35 Chapter 4 Fractonic Exactly Solvable Models As in the case of the topologically ordered systems discussed previously, fractonic order are usually gapped. In this chapter we study three exactly solvable gapped models: the X- Cube model, the Haah and the Chamon code. We investigate their main properties and see how fractonic signatures, as excitation restricted mobility and UV/IR mixing emerge in such models. 4.1 X-Cube Model The X-Cube model is a 3-dimensional system deﬁned on a lattice which presents Type I fractons as excitations. Firstly proposed in [11], it is an exactly solvable model and provides a good model to gain some intuition about general properties about fractons. It is a gapped model and presents fractons, lineons and planons as excitations above the ground state. The X-Cube Hilbert space is deﬁned on a cubic lattice with qubit degrees of freedom living on the links. It is speciﬁed by the Hamiltonian HXC = − ∑ C BC − ∑ µ=x,y,z ∑ vµ Aµ v (4.1) = − ∑ C ∏ l∈∂C Xl − ∑ µ=x,y,z ∑ vµ ∏ l⋉vµ Zl. (4.2) The cube terms BC are products of the twelve X Pauli operators in the cube edges ∂C and Aµ v are products of the four Z Pauli operators at the links connected to the vertex vµ in the plane normal to the µ -direction. The Figure 4.1 illustrates such operators, where the dots lies on the lattice links. FIGURE 4.1: Cube and star operators. Source: [36] All the operators mutually commute and their energies can be minimized simultaneously. This is what gives the model its exactly solvable character and its gapped spectrum. Roughly, 36 Chapter 4. Fractonic Exactly Solvable Models when the Hamiltonian involves a set of non-compatible operators, the low-energy physics al- lows gapless ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom in order to minimize the total energy. This hap- pens, for example, in the Z2 lattice gauge theory (3.1) in its critical point g = gc, t = tc, where the theory is a CFT. We must ﬁnd the ground state |ψ⟩ such that BC |ψ⟩ = Aµ v |ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩, ∀ C and v ∈ Λ. (4.3) Deﬁned on a torus, the ground state is not unique. In fact, if the lattice Λ has Lx × Ly × Lz links, the model ground state degeneracy is given by log2 GSDXC = 2Lx + 2Ly + 2Lz − 3, (4.4) as we shall see soon. This is a hallmark of fracton systems: the ground state degeneracy depends on the lat- tice size. Such characteristic brings up some difﬁculties in ﬁnding continuum descriptions of fracton systems, since they usually only takes into account universal properties of physical systems neglecting most of microscopic details. Equation (4.4) signals to UV/IR mixing, as the low-energy physics (IR) is very sensible to UV details. In order to understand the degeneracy, let us introduce non-contractible loop operators. Let us consider the (µ, n)-plane which is the plane normal to the µ direction lying in the n coordinate in the µ axis. Let γ∗ν (µ,n) be a curve in the dual lattice lying in the (µ, n) plane oriented in the ν ̸= µ direction, as shown in Figure 4.2. FIGURE 4.2: The curve γ∗ν (µ,n) lying in the dual-lattice of the plane (µ, n) crossing the transverse links (in red). The set of non-contractible loop operators T (γ∗ν (µ,n)) = ∏ ℓ∈γ∗ν (µ,n) Zℓ (4.5) commutes with the X-Cube Hamiltonian. Thus, if a given state |0⟩ is a ground state of the system with energy E0, T (γ∗ν (µ,n)) |0⟩ is also a ground state with the same energy. The role of the loop operator is to introduce a Z2 ﬂux in the ν direction of the T2 torus lying in the (µ, n)-plane. There is two possible Z2 ﬂuxes ±1 through the two directions for each of the Lx × Ly × Lz planes, telling us that, in principle, we have 22Lx+2Ly+2Lz distinct ground states. 4.1. X-Cube Model 37 However, not all the loop operators are independent. In fact, they must obey the following three constraints: ∏ n T (γ∗ν (µ,n)) = ∏ n T (γ∗µ (ν,n)) . (4.6) For each pair of distinct directions x − y, y − z and z − x, we have one of the above constraint. The effect of the constraints is to reduce the “naive” ground state degeneracy 22Lx+2Ly+2Lz by a factor of 23, leading us to the ﬁnal expression in (4.4). The application of Z operator at a link ﬂips the sign of all the cube operators BC which has this link in their edges {Zl1, BC } = 0, l1 ∈ ∂C. (4.7) Since a given link is shared by four cubes, the application of Z creates four cube excitations with eigenvalue −1 of the BC operator. These four excitations can be separated from each other through the application of Z on the links of a rectangular membrane geometry, as in ﬁgure 4.3. These “membrane” operators create four excitations in their corners that, individually, are not able to move: the only way to move an individual cube excitation would be applying Z at an edge of the cube. However, this process creates other three excitations, having a large energetic cost. Individual cube excitations have restricted mobility: they are fractons! In contrast, a pair of adjacent cube excitations in this membrane is allowed to move as a bound state. They can be seen as dipole-like excitations which are two-dimensional particles: planons allowed to move in the normal plane of the dipole axis. The X-Cube model presents Type I fractons. FIGURE 4.3: Four cube excitation spatially spaced by the application of the Z operator on a rectangular membrane. Source: [12] In addition, the model presents excitations associated with the Aµ v terms. The application of the X operator on a string of links anti commutes the vertex terms Aµ v . These vertex excitations are created in pairs and can move in one dimension through the application of these X string operators. A given vertex excitation is a one-dimensional particle (a lineon) and cannot be moved along other directions since it would create different kind of excitations. A pair of lineons, a dipole-like object, is a dimension-2 particle allowed to move along the normal plane to the dipole axis. 38 Chapter 4. Fractonic Exactly Solvable Models FIGURE 4.4: A pair of lineons, created by a string of X operators on the vacuum state. Source: [12] 4.2 Chamon Code Proposed in 2005 by Chamon [9], this exactly solvable model can be thought as the 3D gen- eralization of the 2D Wen’s plaquette model 3.97. Firstly investigated due to its quantum glassi- ness property, it was the ﬁrst exactly solvable model which presents fracton phenomenology. As we argue in this section, this model is a three-dimensional gapped Type I fractonic system. The Chamon code is deﬁned on a face-centered cubic lattice with the degrees of freedom living on the faces of the cubes. At each site, both on the cubic vertices and the face centers, we place a spin qubit. More precisely, let us consider the lattice generated by the R3 canonical basis vectors ˆxi, with ˆx1 ≡ ˆx, ˆx2 ≡ ˆy and ˆx3 ≡ ˆz. We refer to as any site in the lattice through their position vector in relation to some origin ⃗x = x1 ˆx1 + x2 ˆx2 + x3 ˆx3, with xi ∈ Z. If a site ⃗x is such that ∑3 1 xi = odd, we call ˆx an odd site. If, on the other hand, the sum of the ⃗x site coordinates is even, we call ˆx an even site. The set of all even and odd sites constitutes the Λeven and Λodd sub-lattices, respectively. The physical system consists of a physical qubit located at every site of Λeven. The sites located in Λodd play the role of link variables between the qubits. This spin conﬁguration forms a cubic faced-centered qubit structure lattice. The unit cell, in this framework, is not generated by primitive vectors but by the composition of the basis vectors ˆxi. For example, the qubits located at the sites associated with the coordinates (0, 0, 0), (2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2), (0, 2, 2) (2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2) (2, 2, 2), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1) (0, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2) form an unit cell in a cubic faced-centered lattice. Deﬁne the “octahedron” operators S⃗x in the even sites ⃗x ∈ Λodd in terms of the Z2 Pauli operators Pi acting on the six next-neighbors qubits living at the even sites: S⃗x ≡ 3 ∏ i=1 Pi ⃗x− ˆxi Pi ⃗x+ ˆxi . (4.8) The Hamiltonian of this system is deﬁned as the sum of such operators ˆH = −h ∑ ⃗x∈Λodd (S⃗x + S† ⃗x) . (4.9) All the S⃗x operators commute with each other. If two octahedron operators share just one site, as in Figure 4.5 a), they apply the same “ﬂavor” of the Pauli operator in the ⃗x ∈ Λeven site and the commutation follows immediately. If two octahedron operators share two sites 4.2. Chamon Code 39 ⃗x ∈ Λeven, as in Figure 4.5 b), the anti commutation relation in both sites cancel each other so that both S⃗x operators commute. FIGURE 4.5: Possibilities of sharing sites between distinct octahedron operators. The black dot belongs to Λodd and the black square belongs to Λeven. In both cases, the operators commute between themselves. Source: Adapted from [18]. The ground state of the model can be exactly found and simultaneously diagonalizes all octahedron operators. The ground state of the lattice model is such that it corresponds to S⃗x = +1 for all ⃗x ∈ Λodd. Let the lattice Λ be a T3 torus (periodic boundary conditions in the three directions) with even length dimensions Lx, Ly and Lz. The ground state degeneracy is GSD = 24g, with 2g = gcd(Lx, Ly, Lz), (4.10) with gcd (x, y, z) the greater common divisor among Lx, Ly and Lz [37]. For the case in which Lx = Ly = Lz ≡ L, we have that 2g = L and log2 (GSD) = 2L. (4.11) Defects in this model correspond to octahedrons with S⃗x = −1 and they cannot be individ- ually created. If we apply, say, the Z Pauli operator at the site ⃗u ∈ Λeven above the ground state, the octahedron operators S⃗x located at the sites ⃗u + ˆx1, ⃗u − ˆx1, ⃗u + ˆx2 and ⃗u − ˆx2 (4.12) will anti commute with it, {Z⃗u, S⃗x} = 0, telling us that four excitations are created. This process requires a large energetic cost of ∆E ∼ 8h ≫ 1 for large coupling h. If we apply the Z operator again, say, at the site ⃗u + 2 ˆx1, in an attempting to move an excitation around, we end up with the creation of two other excitations, what it is energetically forbidden. In fact, the excitations, once created cannot be individually moved: they are immobile fractons. As in the X-Cube model, fractons excitations can be separated apart through a membrane operator. As shown in Figure 4.6, four octahedron excitations are created in the corner of the membrane operator W(M) = ∏⃗u∈M Z⃗u. In every process for excitation creation, both the charge and the dipole momentum are con- served. This is an important feature of this model and will still hold in the effective theory for the low-energy description (see Section 7.3). There are, however, string operators in this model [37], i.e., there are mobile excitations above the ground state. Consider the four fracton excitations created in the sites (4.12) by the application of Z⃗u, in the site ⃗u ∈ Λeven above the ground state. If we apply Z operators along the n-sized string γn = {(⃗u + 2 ˆx1 + 2 ˆx2), (⃗u + 4 ˆx1 + 4 ˆx2), . . . , (⃗u + 2n ˆx1 + 2n ˆx2)} (4.13) 40 Chapter 4. Fractonic Exactly Solvable Models FIGURE 4.6: Membrane operator application above the ground state on a z = cte plane of the lattice. Black dots are even sites, where Z⃗u is applied and white dots are odd sites. The four blue circulated white sites are the location of the octahedron excitations. Source: [37] we move the two excitations previously in ⃗u + ˆx1 and ⃗u + ˆx2 respectively to the sites ⃗u + (2n + 1) ˆx1 and ⃗u + (2n + 1) ˆx2. The fractons are able to move along a line as dipole bound states: a dipole of fractons is a lineon. Such lineons are restricted to move only along cube face-diagonal directions. The Chamon code is, indeed, a Type I fracton system, where individual fractons are able to move only as dipole bound states. Further string operators do exist ins this model (as ﬂexible string operators) and are extensively discussed in [37]. The origin of excitations mobility restrictions relies on the octahedron operators structure. Less obviously, another consequence which follows from it is the conservation of the Z2 charge for any plane Σ⃗t,α. The plane Σ⃗t,α is perpendicular to the cube diagonal direction⃗t = (tx, ty, tz) and is deﬁned as the set of points {(x, y, z) ∈ Λodd|txx + tyy + tzz = α}. There are, in our system, four cube diagonal directions⃗t = {(1, 1, 1), (−1, 1, 1), (1, −1, 1), (1, 1, −1)}. Let s(⃗x) = ±1 be the eigenvalue associated to S⃗x in the site ⃗x ∈ Λodd. The Z2 charges in the planes Σ⃗t,α θ⃗t,α = ∑ ⃗x∈Σt,α s(⃗x), mod 2 (4.14) are conserved under the application of any operator and are called topological charges [37]. As mentioned above, the conservation of θ⃗t,α in such planes follows from the fact that every process in the theory respects the octahedral symmetry. 4.3 Haah Code The Haah Code is a three dimensional gapped fractonic model deﬁned on a cubic lattice. In contrast to the X-Cube model and the Chamon code, the Haah code is a type-II fracton model where the fractons are unable to move, neither as bound states. This is a consequence to the fact that there is no string-like operators in this model. The Haah code was proposed in 2011 by Haah [10] and consists of two qubits per lattice site. The Hamiltonian is written as the sum of two cubic terms H = − ∑ C AC − ∑ C BC, (4.15) 4.3. Haah Code 41 where AC and BC are deﬁned as a product of Pauli operators along the cube edges and are deﬁned in Figure 4.7. In the operators deﬁnition, I refers to the identity operator. FIGURE 4.7: Cube operators in the Haah code. Source: [36] As in the X-Cube model, all the operators simultaneously commute [AC, AC ′ ] = [BC, BC ′ ] = [AC, BC ′ ] = 0 ∀C, C ′ ∈ Λ, (4.16) giving the model exactly solvable and gapped properties. The ﬁrst and second vanishing com- mutation rules follows trivially. The commutation relations among the AC and BC follows triv- ially when they share no qubits and, otherwise, can be understood in terms of the three cases shown in Figure 4.8. In all the three cases, one can verify that they always commute. There is FIGURE 4.8: The cube operators AC and BC nontrivial commutators. They can share four, two or one vertices (in red). always an even number of anti-commutations so that the cube operators always commute. The ground state of the Haah code is an eigenstate of the cube operators AC and BC for every cube C ∈ Λ with eigenvalue +1. For the cases in which Λ is a nontrival topological space, the ground state is degenerate. The counting of the ground state degeneracy, however, is more complicated than in the X-Cube model. In a L × L × L torus, GSD is a complicated non-monotonic function of L and is bounded by above by [10] log2 GSD < 4L. (4.17) This model possesses a self-duality between the two kinds of operators AC and BC, such that sufﬁces to study only one excitation ﬂavor. The structure of the Hilbert space and the operators in the Hamiltonian give the excitations a tetrahedron structure. For illustration purposes let 42 Chapter 4. Fractonic Exactly Solvable Models us act with, say, the IZ operator on a given vertex of the lattice. Four BC cube excitations are created {BC, IZ} = 0, (4.18) in a tetrahedron structure as shown in Figure 4.9. FIGURE 4.9: Application of IZ operator in the indicated (red dot) vertex. It cre- ates four BC excitations in a tetrahedron structure. The cube excitations can be separated from one another by applications of IZ operator in other vertices in a tetrahedral structure. Geometrically this is done by inserting tetrahedron structures inside tetrahedron structures as shown in Figure 4.10. It gives rise to a fractal ar- rangement and for this reason the application of IZ in such lattice vertices is called tetrahedron fracton operator. The fracton excitations appears always at the corners of the tetrahedron frac- ton operator. FIGURE 4.10: Fracton operator in the Haah code. The individual cube excitations are indicated by the yellow stars. Source: Adapted from [12]. This can, of course, be done with the application of others operators than IZ, giving rise to different oriented tetrahedron fractal structures. The same is valid for IX and AC operators. In contrast to the X-Cube model and the Chamon code, dipole bound states of fractons in this model are not mobile. In fact, it can be shown that there are no string operators in the the Haah code [10]. In other words, all possible bound state of fractons are also fractons. 43 Chapter 5 Coupled Layers Construction Topological ordered systems in two dimensions allow us to construct 3d fracton phases. This construction is, in general, non-unique and allow us to build more interesting and richer phases by considering stacks of coupled two-dimensional topological systems. In the inﬁnite coupling limit, stacks of two-dimensional toric code systems result in the three-dimensional X-Cube model. To check this result, we analyze it throughout perturbation theory technology. Up to sixth order in perturbation theory, we recover the X-Cube Hamiltonian while further corrections are suppressed by inverse powers of the inﬁnite coupling constant. The coupling parameter J provides a smooth way to switch between the free toric code layers J → 0 and the X-Cube model J → ∞ through the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are able to understand the X-Cube physics, as the fracton emergence and the ground state degeneracy, in the intermediate coupling limit. In this chapter we mainly follow [19] and [36]. 5.1 X-Cube from Coupled Toric Codes 5.1.1 Strong Coupling We recover the X-Cube model from two-dimensional layers of toric code models and strongly coupling them. Let us consider a set of toric code planes aligned the xy, yz, and zx planes in a square lattice and let us impose periodic boundary conditions in each one of them. The result is a cubic lattice where each vertex i belongs to three perpendicular planes and each link lies in the intersection of two different orthogonal planes. Let us denote a link which starts in the ver- tex j aligned with the unit vector ˆxi as ℓ = (j, ˆxi). The Hamiltonian of this set of non-interacting toric code models is given by a sum of Hamiltonians (3.31), one for each plane P H f ree = ∑ P ( − ∑ i∈P Ao(P) i − ∑ p∈P Bo(P) p ) . (5.1) The upper index o(P) = { ˆx1, ˆx2, ˆx3} refers to as the normal direction to the plane P. In the above expression, the Ao(P) i operator is a product of Z Pauli operators on the four links ℓ connected to the vertex i, all lying in the P plane and the Bo(P) p operator is a product of X Pauli operators on the p plaquette boundary, which belongs to the P plane Ao(P) i = ∏ ℓ⊥o(P) Zo(P) ℓ and Bo(P) p = ∏ ℓ∈∂p Xo(P) ℓ . (5.2) 44 Chapter 5. Coupled Layers Construction The upper index o(P) is necessary on the Pauli operators Zℓ and Xℓ because, from the geomet- rical arrangement of the toric code planes, there are two qubits lying in every link ℓ = (j, ˆxi): one from each of the two planes P which contains ℓ (Figure 5.1). FIGURE 5.1: Two qubits lying in the link ℓ, coming from the planes P1 and P2. The Hamiltonian (5.1) is a free theory in the sense that every plane system is blind to the others. We introduce interactions among them by coupling the two qubits lying in the same geometrical link. The form of the coupling among them will directly affect the resulting theory in the strongly coupling limit. Here we study a ZZ coupling and we are able to recover the X- Cube model in perturbation theory. A different coupling is also possible but gives us a different theory. In fact, a XX coupling in the strongly coupled regime gives us, in perturbation theory, the three dimensional Toric Code system [19]. Let Jz be the coupling constant that measures the strength of the interaction and consider the Hamiltonian H = H f ree − Jz ∑ ℓ Zo(P1) ℓ Zo(P2) ℓ , Jz > 0. (5.3) The o(P1) and o(P2) upper indices tell us in which planes the qubits relying in the ℓ = (j, ˆxi) link belong. Both planes P1 and P2 have o(P1), o(P2) ⊥ ˆxi and are perpendicular among themselves o(P1) ⊥ o(P2). In the strong coupling limit Jz → ∞ in order to minimize the energy of the system, the ground state space obeys Zo(P1) ℓ = Zo(P2) ℓ for every link ℓ. Deﬁne the operators Zℓ ≡ Zo(P1) ℓ = Zo(P2) ℓ and the tensorial product Xℓ = Xo(P1) ℓ Xo(P2) ℓ . As we will show in the following, up to sixth order in perturbation theory and discarding constants terms, we recover the X-Cube Hamiltonian HXC = − ∑ i ∑ µ=x,y,z Aµ i − K ∑ C BC, (5.4) with the operators Aµ i = ∏ ℓ⊥µ Zℓ, and BC = ∏ ℓ∈∂C Xℓ (5.5) and the coupling K ∼ J−5 z > 0. 5.1. X-Cube from Coupled Toric Codes 45 Let us now formally develop the perturbation theory. Since the ground state of our model is highly degenerated, we make use of degenerate perturbation theory (Brillouin-Wigner Per- turbation Theory). The general idea in the following approach is to make use of projectors to separately analyze the perturbation action on the ground state space. In the strongly coupled regime, we write the complete Hamiltonian (5.3) as H = H0 + H1, with H0 the dominant interaction term and treat H1 = H f ree perturbatively with perturbation parameter J−1 z . It is convenient to separate the star and plaquette interactions H1 = H1v + H1p and keep in mind that these two operators commute with each other. The unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 forces the two qubits lying in each link to point in the same direction. In the z ket basis, the state in each link ℓ is a (normalized) superposition |ψ⟩ℓ = cℓ↑ |↑↑⟩ℓ + cℓ↓ |↓↓⟩ℓ so that the system state, lying in the ground state space, is the product state ∏ℓ ⊗ |ψ⟩ℓ. The fact of the ground state is product state is a consequence that we have not yet included interactions among qubits lying in different links. The effect of the perturbation H1v and H1p is to favor some spin conﬁgurations in star and plaquette clusters and to entangle different links qubits. It is this highly entangled quantum state the responsible for fracton emergence and topological properties. To have a physical picture in mind, the action of the star perturbation H1v ∼ ∑P ∑i ∏ℓ Zo(P) ℓ on the ground state will only extract z Pauli operators eigenvalues and will map it into, again, the ground state space (in general, a resulting non-product state). In other words, the H1v operators does not spoil the Zo(P1) ℓ = Zo(P2) ℓ constraint. On the other hand, since the Xo(P) ℓ Pauli operator ﬂips the P-plane ℓ-qubit and leave the other ℓ links qubits unﬂipped (spoiling the constraint), the plaquette perturbation H1p ∼ ∑P ∑p ∏ℓ∈∂p Xo(P) ℓ violates the Zo(P1) ℓ = Zo(P2) ℓ constraint. That is, when it acts on a ground state, it returns us a state which does not lie in the ground state space. We say that the operator H1p has vanishing projection onto the ground state space. Let us consider an eigenstate |ψ⟩ of the complete Hamiltonian H with energy E so that it becomes a ground state of H0 in the absence of the perturbation. Let us decompose it as |ψ⟩ = |ψ0⟩ + |ψ1⟩, with |ψ0⟩ belonging to the ground state space H0 |ψ0⟩ = E0 |ψ0⟩ and |ψ1⟩ to the orthogonal complement. Finally, let P be the projector on the ground state P = ∏ℓ (1 + Zo(P1) ℓ Zo(P2) ℓ ) 2 (5.6) and (1 − P ) be the projector on the complement space. We write the Schrodinger equation H |ψ⟩ = E |ψ⟩ as (E − H0) |ψ⟩ = H1 |ψ⟩ ⇒ |ψ⟩ = (E − H0)−1 H1 |ψ⟩ . (5.7) Applying the (1 − P ) projector to the left of the previous equation and using that (1 − P ) |ψ⟩ = |ψ1⟩ and [P, H0] = 0: |ψ1⟩ = (E − H0)−1 (1 − P ) H1 |ψ⟩ . (5.8) We are able to ﬁnd a formal expression to the perturbed states replacing (5.8) into |ψ⟩ = |ψ0⟩ + |ψ1⟩ |ψ⟩ = |ψ0⟩ + (E − H0)−1 (1 − P ) H1 |ψ⟩ , (5.9) 46 Chapter 5. Coupled Layers Construction which we can formally solve by recursive iteration |ψ⟩ = ∞ ∑ n=0 [ 1 − P E − H0 H1 ]n |ψ0⟩ = ∞ ∑ n=0 (DH1)n |ψ0⟩ , D ≡ 1 − P E − H0 . (5.10) If we were able to perform the sum in (5.10) we would ﬁnd the exact lattice ground state of the complete Hamiltonian H. This is, however, a hard task and we ask another question: considering the ground state space (states which obeys the constraint), what is the effect, order by order, of the aplication of the perturbation DH1 on it? In addition, because Zo(P1) ℓ = Zo(P2) ℓ must be strongly implemented, we are interested in the effect of orders of DH1 on |ψ0⟩ so that it returns us a state which, again, obeys the constraint. Namely, we are interested in the effect of perturbations on the ground state space. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of the Effective Hamiltonian. Note that P H |ψ⟩ = EP |ψ⟩ = E |ψ0⟩ and that, applying P H in the left of the equation (5.10), we get E |ψ0⟩ = P (H0 + H1) ∞ ∑ n=0 (DH1)n |ψ0⟩ = E0 |ψ0⟩ + P H1 ∞ ∑ n=0 (DH1)n P |ψ0⟩ . (5.11) Above, for convenience, we wrote |ψ0⟩ = P |ψ0⟩ and used the fact that P H0 ∞ ∑ n=0 (DH1)n |ψ0⟩ = H0P |ψ0⟩ + H0P ∞ ∑ n=1 [ 1 − P E − H0 H1 ]n |ψ0⟩ ︸ ︷︷ ︸ vanishes, since P (1−P )=0 = E0 |ψ0⟩ . (5.12) From the equations (5.11) and (5.11), we are able to deﬁne an effective Hamiltonian which have |ψ0⟩ as an eigenstate and whose eigenvalue measures the difference between the corrected energy E and the unperturbed energy E0 Heff |ψ0⟩ = (E − E0) |ψ0⟩ , (5.13) with the deﬁnition Heff ≡ P H1 ∞ ∑ n=1 (DH1)n−1 P ≡ ∞ ∑ n=1 ˜H(n) eff (5.14) with ˜H(n) eff being the n-th term in the sum. Albeit each ˜H(n) eff appears in the n-th term, it is not genuinely of n-th order in the perturbation H1. This is so because the exact energy E which appears in ˜H(n) eff = P H1 ( 1 − P E − H0 H1 )n−1 P (5.15) 5.1. X-Cube from Coupled Toric Codes 47 also depends on the perturbative parameter E = E0 + O (J−1 z ). So far, we translated our original problem into ﬁnding the effective Hamiltonian pertur- bation terms in (5.14) such that (5.13) is obeyed. The rightmost and leftmost projectors in the deﬁnition of ˜H(n) eff tells us that H1 (DH1)n−1 will always act on the ground state space and return a result that also lies in the ground state space. The fact is that, analyzing the terms which contribute to the effective Hamiltonian, only the ﬁrst and the sixth order terms give nontrivial contributions. All other different order operators give us either vanishing or constant contributions, which we conveniently set to zero. In order to not getting lost into too boring calculations, in the following we analyze only these two nontrivial contributions and argue that they really recover the X-Cube Hamiltonian. The ﬁrst contribution from the perturbation H1 = H1v + H1p is ˜H(1) eff = P H1vP + P H1pP = P H1vP. (5.16) Higher powers of H1v can be simpliﬁed using the Z2 ∼ 1 property, which gives us constant contributions. Up to ﬁfth order, the action of the H1p operator on the ground state space spoils the constraint Zo(P1) ℓ = Zo(P2) ℓ and contributes trivially for the effective Hamiltonian. Extensive analysis can be performed to conclude that, up to ﬁfth order, all other combinations of powers of H1v and H1p either cancels or contributes trivially [19]. Finally, expanding ˜H(n) eff for n = 6 and being careful with the energy expansion E = E0 + O (J−1 z ), we have the nontrivial contribution ˜H(6) eff ⊃ P (H1pD0)5 H1pP, D0 ≡ 1 − P E0 − H0 . (5.17) Let us analyze the action of this operator, from the right to the left. H1pP : |ψ0⟩ ↦→ | ˜ψ⟩ so that | ˜ψ⟩ is a sum of plaquettes in which the constraint is violated; the operator H1pD0 project | ˜ψ⟩ into the ground space complement, measures its energetic difference in relation to E0 and apply again the plaquette operator, spoiling the constraint on links of more plaquettes, resulting in an intermediate state | ˜ψ1⟩; due to the ﬁfth power of this operator, this process is repeated more four times. Finally the leftmost P projects the resulting state onto the ground state space. The physical intuition is that, as each one of the six H1p are applied on the states, more and more plaquettes spoil the constraint Zo(P1) ℓ = Zo(P2) ℓ (See Figure 5.2). However, there is a special combination of spin ﬂipping which survives to the leftmost projector onto the ground space: when the all the links on the plaquettes which constitute a cube are ﬂipped. In this conﬁguration the constraint is again respected and under projection it is able to survive (See Figure 5.3). The operator (5.17) becomes exactly the X-Cube cubic operator. The effective Hamiltonian Heff = P H1vP + P (H1pD0)5 H1pP (5.18) is exactly the X-Cube Hamiltonian deﬁned in (5.4). The star operators Aµ i comes from the H1v term and the cubic operators BC from the ∼ (H1p)6 term. The energy payed for violating the constraint it proportional to Jz, so that, at each energetic measure H0 in the denominator of D0, it extracts a Jz factor. The coefﬁcient of the cubic term in (5.4) is proportional to J−5 z . 48 Chapter 5. Coupled Layers Construction FIGURE 5.2: The blue links represent violated constrains. The ﬁgure shows ex- amples of resulting states which violate the constraint when ∼ (H1p)n act on |ψ0⟩ for n = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. FIGURE 5.3: In sixth order in perturbation theory, there is a special combination of constraint violation that survives to the leftmost projector in (5.17). 5.1.2 Mapping Between the Degrees of Freedom The Hamiltonian (5.3) for a generic Jz value interpolates between the free toric code models (Jz = 0) and the X-Cube system (Jz → ∞). It suggests a smooth connection between the frac- tonic and toric code topological orders. Let us consider the effect of the interaction term in the weak and intermediate coupling regime. This regime allows us to map the properties of the X-Cube model to the toric code degrees of freedom. For this purpose it is useful to introduce the concept of p−strings. Let us consider the coupling term Zo(P1) ℓ Zo(P2) ℓ in the interpolating Hamiltonian. It anti- commutes with the four plaquettes operators Bo(P) p so that ℓ ∈ ∂p in both planes P that contain the link ℓ {Zo(P1) ℓ Zo(P2) ℓ , Bo(P) p } = 0. (5.19) The action of the coupling operator Zo(P1) ℓ Zo(P2) ℓ on the link ℓ = (j, ˆxi) creates four plaquette defects Bp = −1, as indicated by the black crosses in the Figure 5.4 (a). This is a collection of m-excitations of the toric code, two in each plane P such that o(P) ⊥ ˆxi. To further analyze, it is useful to represent such a collection of magnetic excitations in a string picture. Let us draw a perpendicular crossing line through each plaquette where m particles lie and let us join line segments entering into the same cube. In this picture, the action of the coupling operator creates a closed string - a closed p−string, as indicated in blue in the Figure 5.4 (a). Larger closed p−strings can be created through the action of the coupling operator at links lying in a membrane operator (Figure 5.4 (b)). The letter p, from p−strings, refers to “particles”. 5.1. X-Cube from Coupled Toric Codes 49 FIGURE 5.4: (a) Closed p−string formed by the four m excitations in the two toric code planes. (b) Larger closed p−strings can be achieved through the application of the coupling operator on transversal links on a rectangular membrane. Source: [36] In the decoupled phase (Jz = 0), the ground state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H f ree such that Bp = Ao(P) i = 1 every where. As Jz > 0 is increased, the ground state of H contains more and more closed p−strings, until certain limit where the coupling operator induces a string condensate ground state. In the limit Jz → ∞, where we recover the X-cube model, the ground state contains strings of all sizes which are free to propagate throughout the system. We can now ask how the X-cube physics emerge in Jz → ∞ limit in terms of the toric code planes degrees of freedoms. Let us consider electrical excitations (e particles) on toric code planes. As we will argument, in the condensed phase individual e excitations are conﬁned. To see this, let us calculate the mutual statistics between e particles and p−strings. Let ePµ 0 refers to as an electric particle belonging to the toric code in the plane Pµ 0 such that o(Pµ 0 ) = ˆµ. The process we investigate is the braiding of a p−string at a ﬁxed ePµ 0 particle located at the origin of our coordinate system so that o(Pµ 0 ) can be ˆx1, ˆx2 or ˆx3 corresponding, receptively, to the planes yz, zx and xy indicated in the Figure 5.5. In the magnetic particle picture, for each plane Pν that the p−string intersects there is a magnetic mPν particle lying in that plane. As we braid a magnetic particle around an electric particle, both lying in the same plane, the quantum state gets a π phase (See 3.2 section). This result, which follows from the toric code model, holds individually for each plane in the cou- pled layers system. From the Figure 5.5 the mPz 0 particles associated to the p−string in the plane z = 0 braids around the ePµ 0 particle during the process and get a π phase only if ˆµ = ˆz. If ˆµ ̸= ˆz, the ePµ 0 mutual statistics with the mPz 0 particles is trivial θePµ 0 ,mPz 0 = πδµ,z. (5.20) The very same arguments apply to the yz and the zx planes. Along the braiding process present in the Figure 5.5, the quantum state gets a nontrivial phase θePµ, p−string = ∑ ν=x,y,z θePµ 0 ,mPν 0 = π. (5.21) Because this braiding phase is nontrivial, all individual eP particles become conﬁned in the 50 Chapter 5. Coupled Layers Construction FIGURE 5.5: Braiding of a p−string around an e excitation located in the Pµ 0 plane. The process is performed so that the right side (x > 0) of the string is kept im- mobile and the left side is continuously deformed along the gray dashed path. Source: [36] p−string condensate phase. The Figure 5.7 schematically shows the two phases of the model (5.3). There are, however, allowed excitations in this phase. Let us consider two electric excita- tions ePi and eQi lying in the vertex i of two distinct planes P and Q so that o(P) ̸= o(Q). The bound state of such particles ei µ = ePν i × ePλ i , (5.22) with ˆµ = o( ˆν, ˆλ) the orthogonal direction to both ˆν and ˆλ, is an allowed excitation in the p- string condensate. The e excitations have trivial mutual statistics with the p−strings and are deconﬁned in the Jz → ∞ phase. This follows from the fact that the mutual phase (5.21) receives the contribution of π from two distinct planes and sums to zero modulo 2π. The fusion rules for two e particles lying in the same lattice vertex i can be derived from the toric code fusion rules (3.53) ei µ × ei ν = { ei o(µ,ν), ˆµ ̸= ˆν 1, ˆµ = ˆν } . (5.23) We can understand the above result in terms of the toric code electric excitations. For ˆµ ̸= ˆν ei µ × ei ν = (ePλ i × ePα i ) × (ePλ i × ePβ i ) = ePα i × ePβ i = ei o(µ,ν), (5.24) with ˆµ = o(λ, α), ˆν = o(β, λ) and naturally o(α, β) = o(µ, ν). For ˆµ = ˆν the four eP particles pairwise annihilate each other and results in 1. For the following result, it is important to stress that given an electric excitation eP at a plane P, there is no way to move this excitation in the o(P) direction. Then, if we try to move eµ particles in any direction perpendicular to the ˆµ direction, the bound state ePν × ePλ is broken. In fact, to preserve the bound state, we can only move it the ˆµ direction, i.e., along the intersection line of the planes Pν and Pλ. These one-dimensional particles are exactly the lineons found in the X-Cube model (4.1) associated to the Aµ ν operators. 5.1. X-Cube from Coupled Toric Codes 51 FIGURE 5.6: (a) Open p−string formed by a stack of m excitations in the 2d toric code systems. (b) Deformation of the open string throughout the application of the Zx ℓ Zz ℓ operator. Source: [36] We can also understand the fractons associated to the cube operator BC excitations in terms of the 2d toric code excitations. In the coupled layers model, they correspond to the endpoints of open p−strings. To see it, let us ﬁrst analyze the decoupled limit Jz = 0. A stack of m particles in the xy planes (Figure 5.6 (a)) forms a ﬁnite open p−string in the z-direction. Deformations of the string-bulk can be performed by applying the coupling Zx ℓ Zz ℓ operator. Albeit the bulk of the string can be freely deformed, the application of the coupling operator fails to move the string endpoints around. It follows from the the fact that the coupling operator preserves the Z2 ﬂux through the cubes. In the condensate phase Jz → ∞, inﬁnite open-string bulk ﬂuctuations size are allowed at zero energetic cost, indicating us they no longer carry physical meaning but only their endpoints. The Z2 cube ﬂux conservation under Zµ1 ℓ Zµ2 ℓ tell us that there is no local operator able to change such ﬂux. As a consequence, open-string endpoints excitations are not allowed to move. They correspond to the cube fracton excitations BC in the X-Cube model (4.1) and we denote them by mC. In terms of the toric code variables, the fusion rules for such particles are mC × mC = 1. Let σ be a rectangular membrane in the lattice. Then the following operator creates four mC excitations, one in each of its corners Mσ = ∏ ℓ|ℓ∩σ̸=0 Zz ℓ, (5.25) which in the Jz → ∞ limit becomes Mσ = ∏ ℓ|ℓ∩σ̸=0 Zℓ. (5.26) It is exactly the membrane operator in the X-Cube model (4.3). For the case in which the mem- brane operator acts only along a line, it creates one mC excitation in each of its two endpoints. That is how the toric code m excitations survive to the strong coupling Jz → ∞ limit in the X-Cube picture. To summarize, we have seen how the X-Cube fracton excitations can be directly mapped into the 2d toric code m and e particles: the e particles survive as bound states of two-dimensional particles (each eP particle can move along its belonging plane) and result into a one-dimensional particle (X-Cube lineons). The m particles survive by breaking them into pairs of immobile par- ticles (X-Cube fractons). 52 Chapter 5. Coupled Layers Construction FIGURE 5.7: Two phases of the interpolating Hamiltonian. For small Jz we have a system of free toric codes and for Jz ≫ 1 we perturbatively recover the X-Cube Hamiltonian. 5.1.3 Ground State Degeneracy The layer construction approach allows us not only to understand the excitations nature, but also to understand the ground state degeneracy from the toric code degrees of freedom. Let our system be deﬁned on a T3 torus with dimensions L × L × L. As we explicitly saw in the Section 3.31, the ground state degeneracy for the 2d toric code system deﬁned on a T2 torus is 22 = 4. To do it, let us count how many independent logical operators there are in the system. With periodic boundary conditions, each one of the 3L planes constitutes a T2 torus. Let (µ, n) be the plane orthogonal to the µ direction with µ coordinate n. Let also γ∗ν (µ,n) be the closed loop oriented in the ν direction and which belongs to the dual lattice of the (µ, n)−plane. The ’t Hooft loop operators Tm(γ∗ν (µ,n)) = ∏ ℓ∈γ∗ν (µ,n) Zµ ℓ (5.27) commute with the Hamiltonian (5.3) and their role is to introduce Z2 ﬂux throughout the (µ, n)−plane along the ν direction. In the system there are 3L planes, resulting in 6L logical operators - 2 logical operators for each plane, as in the toric code. The 6L operators, however, are not all independent. Indeed, one can see that for any two distinct directions µ and ν, the logical operators obey ∏ 0≤n<L Tm (γ∗ν (µ,n)) = ∏ 0≤n<L Tm (γ∗µ (ν,n)) ≡ Mµν, (5.28) In the strongly coupled limit, the Mµν quantity is the membrane operator on the entire plane orthogonal to o(µ, ν). There are three pairs of distinct planes, namely xy, yz and zx and, conse- quently, three constraints Mµν = Mνµ. Thus, there are in the total 6L − 3 independent logical operators in the system, each one contributing with a factor of 2 to the ground state degeneracy. Thus log2(GSDXC) = 6L − 3, (5.29) 5.1. X-Cube from Coupled Toric Codes 53 which agrees with our previous result (4.4) for the case in which Lx = Ly = Lz ≡ L. The coupled layer construction philosophy is very similar to quantum wires approach in the sense we understand complicated systems in terms of simpler “building blocks”. Coupling many layers of two-dimensional toric codes we were able to recover, in degenerate perturba- tion theory, the X-Cube Hamiltonian, to understand the fracton degrees of freedom in terms of the electric and magnetic toric code excitations and to successfully count the ground state degeneracy. 55 Chapter 6 Fracton Effective Theories: Bottom-Up Approach So far, we are familiarized with two mechanisms to study fractonic phases: their emergence in exactly solvable models and their appearance in coupled layer construction. In this chapter we study Abelian low-energy effective ﬁeld theories where fractons may appear, making use of general arguments of effective ﬁeld theories. The algorithm is to add all the operators which are compatible with the symmetries of the system in the Lagrangian and then analyze their relevance in low-energy physics. 6.1 Gapless Tensor Gauge Theory Tensor gauge ﬁeld theories can be thought as the tensor generalization of vector ﬁeld the- ories and are expressed in terms of higher-rank gauge tensor ﬁelds Aij(⃗x, t). In an attempt to generalize Maxwell theory, we can build both scalar charge gauge and vector charge gauge theories. As we will argue, both of them are able to describe fractonic phenomena. In general, scalar charge gauge theory means that, as in usual Maxwell theory, our charge density is de- scribed by a scalar quantity. In the other hand, in a vector tensor gauge theory the charges are described by a vector. Let us ﬁrst consider a 3D symmetric scalar charge tensor gauge theory Aij = Aji with the symmetric tensor gauge transformation Aij → Aij + ∂i∂jα. Higher-rank gauge tensor theories naturally leads to higher momentum conservation laws. To see it, we follow [12] and consider the Gauss law in the charged sector. Let Eij = Eji be the conjugate electric ﬁelds and its Gauss law in the presence of charged matter ∂i∂jEij = ρ. (6.1) The above equation reproduces the main characteristic of fracton systems: it restricts particles mobility. Note that the charge, in a region Γ Q = ∫ Γ d3xρ = ∫ Γ d3x∂i∂jEij = ∮ ∂Γ dnj∂iEij, (6.2) can only change through the charge ﬂux through the boundary, that is, it is a locally conserved quantity. Just as in the usual Maxwell vector gauge theory, the Gauss law forbids the creation, say, of single particles in a region of space. In addition, the dipole moment Pi = ∫ Γ d3xρxi = ∫ Γ d3 (∂k∂jEkj) xi = ∮ ∂Γ dnk (xi∂jEjk − Eik) , (6.3) 56 Chapter 6. Fracton Effective Theories: Bottom-Up Approach which is expressed as a integral on the boundary of the Γ region is also locally conserved. The conservation law (6.3) accounts for the fractons phenomenology. One charge, alone, is unable to move, since it would violate local dipole momentum conservation. Charges are allowed to move only as dipole bound states as long as they preserve the modulo and direction of the dipole momentum. The charged particles of this model are prototypes for describing fractons. The key fact responsible for the particle mobility restriction is the second derivative structure of the Gauss law, so that we are able to integrate by parts the above relations. As mentioned, we can also deﬁne a symmetric vector charge tensor gauge theory, that is, a theory in which we promote our charge density to a rank 1 vector. In such theory we are able to construct a theory whose Gauss law reads ∂iEij = ρj. (6.4) This set of equations, in contrast to the previous one, leads to the conservation of both charge ⃗Q = ∫ Γ d3x⃗ρ = ∫ Γ d3x∂i⃗Ei = ∮ ∂Γ dnj⃗Ej (6.5) and angular charge moment ⃗M = ∫ Γ d3x (⃗ρ × ⃗x) = ∫ Γ d3x (∂i⃗Ei × ⃗x) = ∮ ∂Γ dni ( ⃗Ei × ⃗x) , (6.6) where we have made use of the electric ﬁeld tensor symmetry Eij = Eji and deﬁned ⃗Ei ≡(Ei1, Ei2, Ei3). The above conservation relation tell us that in every local process that occurs in- side Γ, ⃗M must be conserved. So, not all particles are allowed to move in any direction. Instead, a particle charged with ρi is allowed to only move along the i direction. This phenomenology accounts for the one dimensional lineons particles. So far we have described how restricted mobility can be naturally embedded in terms of a symmetric tensor gauge ﬁeld. In the following, we construct an effective ﬁeld theory that describes fractonic matter and see how gauge tensor ﬁelds arise naturally. 6.1.1 Gauge Principle In the previous section, we explored mobility restriction properties of charged matter due to the Gauss law in the corresponding symmetric gauge tensor theory. In this section develop, from an EFT viewpoint, a tensor gauge theory for both scalar and vector symmetric tensor gauge theories [15]. The tensor gauge ﬁelds emerges from the gauge principle, which consists of “gauging” a global symmetry, i.e., we make a global symmetry also valid locally. Symmetries and conservation laws requirements will be our leading guide to construct such EFT. Let Φ represent the fractonic matter ﬁeld. We require the theory to be invariant under the transformations Φ → eiαΦ and Φ → ei⃗λ·⃗xΦ (6.7) with α and λi real constants. These symmetry transformations are associated, respectively, to charge and dipole conservation. The imposition of the second transformation to be a symmetry restricts the allowed derivative structure in the theory. The usual spatial derivatives are not 6.1. Gapless Tensor Gauge Theory 57 allowed to be in the Lagrangian since they do not transform in a covariant way: ∂iΦ∗∂iΦ → ∂i (e−i⃗λ·⃗xΦ∗) ∂i (ei⃗λ·⃗xΦ) → e−i⃗λ·⃗x (−iλiΦ∗ + ∂iΦ∗) ei⃗λ·⃗x (iλiΦ + ∂iΦ) → ∂iΦ∗∂iΦ + (λ2 i |Φ|2 + iλiΦ∂iΦ∗ − iλiΦ∗∂iΦ) ̸= ∂iΦ∗∂iΦ. (6.8) Instead, note that: ∂iΦ∂jΦ − Φ∂i∂jΦ → e2i⃗λ·⃗x (Φ∂i∂jΦ − ∂iΦ∂jΦ + iλiΦ∂jΦ + iλjΦ∂iΦ − λiλjΦ2 + λiλjΦ2 − iλiΦ∂jΦ − iλjΦ∂iΦ) → e2i⃗λ·⃗x (∂iΦ∂jΦ − Φ∂i∂j) . (6.9) Following the philosophy of EFT, we write all symmetry compatible operators in the action S[Φ, Φ∗] = ∫ d3xdt |∂tΦ|2 − m2|Φ|2 − g ∣ ∣Φ∂i∂jΦ − ∂iΦ∂jΦ∣ ∣2 − h Φ∗2 (Φ∂2Φ − ∂iΦ∂iΦ) + · · · . (6.10) where · · · contains an inﬁnity quantity of operator terms. In natural units and mass dimension, ﬁxing [xi] = [t] = −1, [Φ] = 1, [m2] = 2, [g] = −4 and [h] = −2, (6.11) which follows from the requirement of the action to be dimensionless. Introducing large mass scale parameter Λ, we deﬁne dimensionless parameters g ≡ ˜g Λ4 and h ≡ ˜h Λ2 . (6.12) They are useful to note that, in a physical process in energy scale E ≪ Λ, ∫ d3xdth Φ∗2 (Φ∂2Φ − ∂iΦ∂iΦ) ∼ ˜h ( E Λ )2 ∫ d3xdtg ∣ ∣Φ∂i∂jΦ − ∂iΦ∂jΦ∣ ∣2 ∼ ˜g ( E Λ )4 , (6.13) which tell us that, the the non-Gaussian term h has a major contribution to the low energy physics than the Gaussian one g. The inﬁnite terms inside . . . in (6.10) will have coupling constants with more and more neg- ative as their operator dimensions get higher and higher. As irrelevant terms, they contribute less and less for in the infrared regime of the theory such that, in practice, we can neglect them. Interactions with other ﬁelds can be introduced by “gauging” the global symmetries (6.7). We gauge the continuous symmetry so that it becomes invariant under transformations with local parameters α(x) and λi(x). As in usual vector gauge theories, the price we must pay to ensure gauge invariance is the introduction of gauge ﬁelds. Under local phase transformations 58 Chapter 6. Fracton Effective Theories: Bottom-Up Approach eiα(x) ∂iΦ∂jΦ − Φ∂i∂jΦ → ei2α (Φ∂i∂jΦ − ∂iΦ∂jΦ + i∂iαΦ∂jΦ + i∂jαΦ∂iΦ − (∂iα∂jα − i∂i∂jα) Φ2 + ∂iα∂jαΦ2 − i∂iαΦ∂jΦ − i∂jαΦ∂iΦ) → ei2α (Φ∂i∂jΦ − ∂iΦ∂jΦ + (i∂i∂jα) Φ2) , (6.14) showing that an extra term (i∂i∂jα) Φ2 emerges. To get rid of it we introduce a symmetric tensor ﬁeld Aij = Aji that also transforms under local phase change and cancels the additional term. Under gauge transformation Φ → eiαΦ, Aij → Aij + ∂i∂jα, (6.15) the derivative operator deﬁned by DijΦ2 = ∂iΦ∂jΦ − Φ∂i∂jΦ − iAijΦ2, (6.16) transforms in a covariant way, namely, DijΦ2 → e2iαDijΦ2. (6.17) A gauge invariant theory is then reached by the replacement of the usual derivative oper- ators by covariant derivatives ones Dij. They provide the coupling between the fractonic ﬁeld Φ and the U(1) tensor gauge ﬁeld Aij. At leading order, S = ∫ d3xdt |DtΦ|2 − m2|Φ|2 − g ∣ ∣DijΦ2∣ ∣2 − h (Φ∗2Di iΦ2 + c.c. ) (6.18) + EijEij − BijBij, (6.19) where we have introduced the covariant time derivative DtΦ ≡ (∂t − iA0) Φ so that, under a time depend gauge transformation A0 → A0 + ∂tα (6.20) and we introduced the gauge invariant electric and magnetic ﬁelds Eij = ∂t Aij − ∂i∂j A0, and Bij = ϵikl∂k Al j. (6.21) The theory in (6.18) is a scalar symmetric gauge tensor ﬁeld theory and has the phenomenology discussed in the previous section with charge density ρ ∼ (Φ∂tΦ∗ − Φ∗∂tΦ). The ﬁeld theory constructed above is a scalar charge tensor gauge theory. We can also obtain a vector charge tensor gauge theory introducing many “ﬂavors” of matter ﬁelds Φa and gauge transformations eiαa(x) in a similar way. The terms ∼ E2 − B2 in the action, in analogy with usual Maxwell theory, leads to gapless theories for both scalar and vector charge tensor gauge theories. The massless excitations are analogous to the photons in vector gauge theories, but with more degrees of freedom. As they are associated with a symmetric rank 2 tensor, they are very close cousins to gravitons. The gravitational aspect of fractons is exploited in [15]. It is interesting to look for gapped fractonic theories, since the exactly solvable lattice mod- els in Section 4 are all gapped. The fractonic theory (6.18) can be turned gapped through the Higgs mechanism, generating mass to the gapless excitations. Pursuing a gapped theory, in the 6.2. Chern-Simons and BF-like Theories 59 next section we investigate Chern-Simons-like theories in 3+1 dimensions. This type of contin- uum ﬁeld theory succeeds to provide low-energy descriptions to the lattice models previously seen . 6.2 Chern-Simons and BF-like Theories BF-theories can be thought as generalizations of Chern-Simons theories for other dimen- sions. In general, BF theories involve topological interaction terms A ∧ dB, with A a one-form and B a (D − 2)−form ﬁelds in a D dimensional spacetime. For the case in 2 + 1 dimensions, dB is the topological conserved current, and the BF term is the current coupling with a vector ﬁeld A. In this section, however, we study generalizations of this type theory, where we may have the A ﬁeld as a tensor ﬁeld. Here we mainly follow [17]. Due to the Levi-Civita symbol structure with only three indices, topological terms between two gauge ﬁelds ϵµνρ Aµ∂νBρ are deﬁned in 2 + 1 dimensions. The generalization to 3 + 1 di- mensions we look for keeps this structure intact. As its cousins in 2 + 1, our theory will have only two spatial components A1 and A2. The price to be paid is the rotational symmetry. The system, instead, remains invariant only under discrete rotations now. Actually, the fracton excitations structure itself, as lineons and planons, doesn’t obey rotational symmetry. Consider two component ﬁeld A1 and A2 so that under an U(1) gauge transformation, they transform as A1 → A1 + D1α, A2 → A2 + D2α (6.22) with Di a derivative operator. The operators Di are generalization of the usual ∂i operators: They may contain more derivatives ∂i∂j . . .. Let the time component of this theory A0 transform as A0 → A0 + ∂tα. Then, the Chern-Simons Lagrangian is LCS = s 4π (A1E2 − A2E1 − (−1)η A0B) , (6.23) where Ei ≡ ∂t Ai − Di A0, and B ≡ D1 A2 − D2 A1 (6.24) are the gauge invariant electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In the above, η = 1 if there are even derivatives and η = 2 if there are an odd number of derivatives in Di. This takes into account how many integration by parts must be taken so that this theory is gauge invariant. This theory contains gapped degrees of freedom in the bulk with an energy gap ∆E ∼ s. The LCS Lagrangian is gauge invariant, up to a boundary term δLCS = s 4π (D1αE2 − D2αE1 − (−1)η∂tαB) = s 4π (D1α∂t A2 + (−1)η∂tαD1 A2 − (D2α∂t A1 + (−1)η∂tαD2 A1) + D2αD1 A0 − D1αD2 A0) , (6.25) so that, for closed of inﬁnite manifolds the theory is gauge invariant. If the underlying space- time manifold contains boundaries, in order to ensure gauge invariance, additional edge de- grees of freedom are needed. In this way, as in the case of usual CS theory, higher-rank Chern- Simons-like theory may be very useful in describing fractonic systems with gapless edge exci- tations. This is the core idea behind bulk-edge correspondence, where the physics in the bulk and the boundary of the system are intrinsically related. 60 Chapter 6. Fracton Effective Theories: Bottom-Up Approach In the absence of matter, the Chern-Simons constraint enforces B = 0. The physical observ- ables of this gapped theory are determined by the gauge invariant holonomies ei ∫ Ai . Irrespec- tive the choice of the Di operators, A1 and A2 are conjugated to each other. For Ai compact, we have discrete and compact Wilson operators. In closed manifolds, this a provides large ground state degeneracy. As we will see in the next chapter, this class of theory is able to provide an EFT for the Chamon Code. Matter is added to the CS Lagrangian by the coupling L = LCS + A0ρ − Ai Ji, provided that the current satisﬁes ∂tρ − Di Ji = 0. (6.26) BF-like theories constructions can be realized in a similar way. With the appropriate deriva- tive operators Di such theories are able to describe Type II fractonic order [38]. We consider two gauge ﬁelds (A0, A1, A2) and (B0, B1, B2) with the following gauge transformations A0 → A0 + ∂tα, B0 → B0 − ∂tα A1 → A1 + D1α, B1 → B1 + ˜D1α A2 → A2 + D2α, B2 → B2 + ˜D2α (6.27) where Di ≡ D(e) i + D(o) i , ˜Di ≡ D(e) i − D(o) i . D(e) i is a differential operator containing an even number of derivatives whereas D(o) i an odd number. The BF-like Lagrangian is LBF = A0 ( ˜D1B2 − ˜D2B1) + B0 (D1 A2 − D2 A1) + A1∂tB2 − A2∂tB1. (6.28) Analogously to the Lagrangian (6.23), LBF is gauge invariant up to boundary terms. In the presence of sources ( ˜D1B2 − ˜D2B1) = ρA (D1 A2 − D2 A1) = ρB, (6.29) with ρA and ρB charges coupled to A and B ﬁelds. If D1 and D2 do not share any common factor, the constraint sufﬁces to kill any propagating degree of freedom in low-energy physics, leading to a completely gapped theory. The A1 ﬁeld is canonically conjugated to B2 and the same is valid for A2 and B1. It may induce nontrivial mutual statistic between ρA and ρB particles. In both the Chern-Simons-like and BF-like theories, the form of the derivative operator is the input of the theory and will determine the physics of the excitations. The gauge structure may allow (or not) gapless boundary modes in the theory and the conservation law, on its turn, may restrict (or not) excitation mobility throughout higher multipole momentum conservation. 61 Chapter 7 Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach In the previous chapter we constructed effective ﬁeld theories for fracton systems based on symmetries, conservation laws and operator relevance. In this chapter, on the other hand, we shall discuss a top-down approach, i.e., starting from the microscopic theory, we shall derive their corresponding ﬁeld theory descriptions. The precise map between the lattice and con- tinuum degrees of freedom is able to provide insights not only about fracton physics but in general properties of topological ordered systems. 7.1 Two-dimensional Type-I Fracton System In this section we will consider gapped fractonic systems in two spatial dimensions. First we propose an exactly solvable lattice model, adapted from the ZN Wen plaquette model, which presents fracton phenomenology. Following the approach in Chapter 3, we use the map present in Ref [18] and ﬁnd a gapped EFT for it. In addition, we generalize such EFT by al- lowing the existence of higher order derivative operators and study the consequences on the excitations mobility. Lattice Model Let us consider a two-dimensional microscopic model deﬁned on a periodic square lattice which presents Type-I fracton phenomenology. In the following, there are ZN qubits lying on the sites of both the original and the dual lattices, as shown in Figure 7.1. FIGURE 7.1: ZN qubits (blue dots) on the sites of the lattice (full lines) and the dual lattice (dashed lines). 62 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach The interacting Hamiltonian is given by a sum of plaquette operators H f rac = − h 2 ∑ p ( ˆBp + ˆB† p) , (7.1) with ˆBp ≡ Xp− ˆa1− ˆa2 Zp+ ˆa1− ˆa2OpXp+ ˆa1+ ˆa2 Zp− ˆa1+ ˆa2 and Op ≡ (X† p)2 (Z† p)2 . (7.2) In the above, p denotes the center of the plaquette and can be located either on the original lattice or on the dual one. The Op term is introduced to keep the Bp plaquette operators neutral under the ZN group. For the N = 2 case, the model results in two copies of the Z2 Wen Plaquette model. In such case, the system does not exhibit fracton phenomenology. The price for the emergence of fractonic properties is the presence of interactions among multiple ZN degrees of freedom in the Bp operators. In the present case, the Bp plaquette operators provide the interaction among ﬁve neighboring ZN qubits. In this section, we are mainly interested in the N ̸= 2 case. This model is exactly solvable, which follows from the fact that all the plaquette operators in the Hamiltonian are compatible. All the possibilities in that two distinct plaquette operators share common sites is depicted in Figure 7.2. From this, we can immediately check that all the plaquette operators commute. FIGURE 7.2: Basic possibilities for two plaquette operators to share common sites (in red). The plaquette operators obey BN p = 1 telling us this is a ZN lattice theory. The ground state is such that Bp |0⟩ = |0⟩ for all plaquettes p of the lattice, which is, however, non-unique. In the Nx × Ny lattice, the dimension of the Hilbert space is N Nx Ny. Due to the constraint ∏p Bp = eiδ, there are N Nx Ny /N independent labels Bp. It indicates us that all the states, including the ground state, are N-fold degenerate. Excitations above the ground state are well localized in space and correspond to Bp |ψ⟩ = e 2πi N |ψ⟩. It is not possible to create isolated excitations through the application of local opera- tors. In addition, isolated particles are completely immobile: they are fractons. There are, as shall see, string operators which are able to move bound states of fractons along straight lines. Therefore, this model corresponds to a Type-I fracton system. There are two kinds of line operators, characterizing the mobility of two types of lineons. Let γ be a straight line oriented in either vertical or horizontal directions and γd be a rigid line which can cross the plaquettes either in the principal (p.d.) or secondary diagonal (s.d) directions. We deﬁne W(γ) ≡ ∏ γ XiZi and V(γd) ≡ {∏γd Xi, γd is oriend with p.d., ∏γd Z† i , γd is oriend with s.d.. (7.3) 7.1. Two-dimensional Type-I Fracton System 63 The excitations above the ground state created by W(γ) and V(γd) are shown in Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4, respectively. The operator W(γ) creates two dipoles, one at each endpoint of the line, which are able to move along the perpendicular direction of the dipole orientation. In contrast, the V(γd) operator creates two dipoles which are, alone, able to move along the dipole axis. FIGURE 7.3: String operator W(γ) (in blue) creating four excitations at its end- points (in red). Although here γ is oriented with the horizontal direction, a verti- cal aligned operator is similarly possible. FIGURE 7.4: String operator V(γd) (in blue) creating four excitations at its end- points (in red). Above, γd is oriented with p.d. and bellow it is parallel to s.d. direction. The two line operators (7.3), deﬁned on non-contractible loops γ and γd obey the algebra V(γd)W(γ) = e 2πiρa N W(γ)V(γd), (7.4) where ρa = lcm(Nx, Ny)/Na for a = x, y depending whether γ is x or y oriented. Since both op- erators commute with the Hamiltonian, such algebra is responsible for the N-fold degeneracy of the ground state. The only way to separate fractons apart is through the application of a membrane operator M(σ) = ∏ ˜σ XiZi, (7.5) where ˜σ means that we apply XiZi on sites of the lattice and not on the ones of the dual lattice. The membrane creates four fractons, one at each corner of it, as show in Figure 7.5. 64 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach FIGURE 7.5: Creation of four fractons through the application of the membrane operator. Effective Field Theory We may ﬁnd the corresponding EFT for such fractonic model by applying the maps (3.66) and (3.67) with the rescaled ﬁeld A → N A Xi = exp iA2 and Zi = exp −iA1. (7.6) We get the continuum B operators ˆB = exp ia2 (∂2 l2 A1 − ∂2 l2 A2 + O(a2)) (7.7) and the continuum Hamiltonian H ∼ −h ∫ d2l cos a2 (∂2 l2 A1 − ∂2 l2 A2 + ...) . (7.8) The derivative are deﬁned as ∂l1 ≡ −∂1 − ∂2 and ∂l2 ≡ ∂1 − ∂2. It leads to the Chern-Simons-like effective action SCS = − N 2π ∫ T2×R d2ldt [A1D0 A2 + A0 (D1 A2 − D2 A1)] , (7.9) with D0 ≡ ∂t, D1 ≡ ∂2 l1 and D2 ≡ ∂2 l2. It is useful to write the above action in a more symmetric way, which resembles the original Chern-Simons theory, namely SCS = − N 4π ∫ T2×R d2ldt [A1 (D0 A2 − D2 A0) + A2 (D1 A0 − D0 A1) + A0 (D1 A2 − D2 A1)] . (7.10) The non-relativistic character of the above theory leads us to an anisotropic dimensional anal- ysis. Let us set [l] = −1 and [t] = −2, then [D0] = [Di] = 2 and [A0] = [Ai] = 1. (7.11) The action (7.10) is invariant under gauge transformations A0 → A0 + D0Λ, A1 → A1 + D1Λ and A2 → A2 + D2Λ, (7.12) 7.1. Two-dimensional Type-I Fracton System 65 up to boundary terms. A gauge-invariant coupling to external currents is of the form Sint = ∫ dtd2l [A0 J0 − A1 J1 − A2 J2] , (7.13) provided that they obey the continuity equation ∂t J0 = D1 J1 + D2 J2, (7.14) which leads to the conservation of the global charge Q = ∫ d2l J0. In addition, given the form of the derivative operators D1 and D2, the generalized charges Q f ≡ ∫ d2l J0 f (l1, l2), with f (l1, l2) = al1l2 + bl1 + cl2, (7.15) are also conserved for arbitrary a, b, c ∈ R. The existence of such generalized charges gives rise to higher multipole moments conservation and can account for the fracton restricted mobility. The form of f (l1, l2) follows from the requirement ∂t f = D1 f = D2 f = 0. To investigate the mobility properties of excitations, let us ﬁrst consider a single charge localized at (l1(t), l2(t)): J0(l1, l2, t) = δ(l1 − l0 1(t))δ(l2 − l0 2(t)). (7.16) From previous arguments, the generalized charges (7.15) Q f = al0 1(t)l0 2(t) + bl0 1(t) + cl0 2(t) = cte (7.17) are conserved for all values of the parameters a, b, c. At ﬁrst sight, it seems that we could ﬁnd a solution of (7.17) allowing certain mobility for the charges compatible with l0 2 = constant − bl0 1 al0 1 + c . (7.18) This solution, however, is not valid for all values of the parameters. Indeed, the case a = c = 0 implies l0 1(t) = constant and l0 2(t) = constant, (7.19) showing there is no mobility of single charges. Nonetheless, dipole-like objects are able to move. Suppose two opposite charged particles, located at (la 1(t), la 2(t)) in the instant of time t with a = 1, 2, J0 = δ(l1 − l1 1(t))δ(l2 − l1 2(t)) − δ(l1 − l2 1(t))δ(l2 − l2 2(t)). (7.20) The conservation of charges in (7.15) yields to a(l1 1l1 2 − l2 1l2 2) + b(l1 1 − l2 1) + c(l1 2 − l2 2) = cte, (7.21) where time dependence is implicit. In contrast to the previous case, there are non-constant solutions for arbitrary a, b and c, e.g., l1 2(t) = l2 2(t) and l1 1(t) = cte b + l2 1(t), (7.22) 66 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach showing that dipole bound states may be mobile through the system. This mobility is repre- sented by the Wilson lines (7.3) W(γ) = e−i ∫ γ A1dli . (7.23) Bulk-Edge Correspondence So far, we studied the system in absence of boundaries, in special, deﬁned on a compact toric manifold. The peculiar derivative structure (7.10) may give rise to a distinct bulk-edge correspondence. We restore gauge invariance by adding dynamical degrees of freedom on the edges, as done in Ref. [39]. Let us consider the system deﬁned on the manifold Ω × R, with Ω = {(l1, l2)|l1 ∈ R, l2 ≤ 0}. In the presence of boundaries, the theory (7.10) is no longer invariant under (7.12) δSCS = − N 4π ∫ dtd2l∂l2 [(∂l2 Λ) (D1 A0 − D0 A1) − Λ∂l2 (D1 A0 − D0 A1)] = − N 4π ∫ dtdl1 (∂l2 Λ) (D1 A0 − D0 A1) ∣ ∣l2=0 − Λ∂l2 (D1 A0 − D0 A1) ∣ ∣l2=0. (7.24) We see that δS = 0 only for the gauge subgroup which obeys ∂l2 Λ∣ ∣l2=0 = Λ∣ ∣l2=0 = 0. (7.25) The price to reestablish the complete U(1) gauge invariance on the theory is to introduce edge degrees of freedom so that δSCS = −δSedge. We deﬁne Sedge = N 4π ∫ dtdl1 ˜φ (D1 A0 − D0 A1) ∣ ∣l2=0 − φ (D1 ˜A0 − D0 ˜A1) ∣ ∣l2=0, (7.26) provided that under gauge transformations φ → φ + Λ, Aµ → Aµ + DµΛ, ˜φ → ˜φ + ∂l2 Λ, ˜Aµ = ˜Aµ + Dµ∂l2 Λ, (7.27) evaluated at l2 = 0, with ˜Aµ∣ ∣l2=0 = ∂l2 Aµ∣ ∣l2=0. Although there is a constraint between ˜Aµ and Aµ, they are independent degrees of freedom. Both ﬁelds Aµ and Aµ + g(l1, t) leads to the same ˜Aµ at the boundary. The edge action (7.26) may store interesting physics at the boundary. To see it, let us note that it counts on an extra invariance under the gauge transformations Aµ → Aµ + Dµα and ˜Aµ → ˜Aµ + Dµ ˜α, for µ = 1, 2. (7.28) We make use of such extra gauge invariance to ﬁx A0∣ ∣l2=0 = vA1∣ ∣l2=0 and ˜A0∣ ∣l2=0 = ˜v ˜A1∣ ∣l2=0. In this fashion Sedge = N 4π ∫ dtdl1 ˜φ (vD1 − D0) A1 − φ ( ˜vD1 − D0) ˜A1, (7.29) where the evaluation at the boundary is implicit. Important to note that the gauge freedom is not completely ﬁxed, we still have the reminiscent freedom A1 → A1 + D1α and ˜A1 → ˜A1 + D1 ˜α, ensured that (D0 − vD1) α = 0 and (D0 − ˜vD1) ˜α = 0. The equations of motion for 7.1. Two-dimensional Type-I Fracton System 67 φ, ˜φ, A1 and ˜A1 give us φ : ( ˜vD1 − D0) ˜A1 = 0 ⇒ ˜A1 ( x2 2 + ˜vt) , ˜φ : (vD1 − D0) A1 = 0 ⇒ A1 ( x2 2 + vt) , A1 : (vD1 + D0) ˜φ = 0 ⇒ ˜φ ( x2 2 − vt) , ˜A1 : ( ˜vD1 + D0) φ = 0 ⇒ φ ( x2 2 − ˜vt) . (7.30) Due to remaining gauge invariance, not all of them, however, correspond to physical degree of freedoms. In fact, both A1 and ˜A1 are pure gauge and can be eliminated by a gauge trans- formation. The boundary action leads to two propagating degrees of freedom φ and ˜φ with “velocities\" v and ˜v, respectively. There are two special cases which we would like to discuss: • For ˜v = v, we can use the remaining gauge invariance to ﬁx A1 = ˜A1 so that Sedge = N 4π ∫ dtdl1 ( ˜φ − φ) (vD1 − D0) A1 = N 4π ∫ dtdl1 ϕ (vD1 − D0) A1. (7.31) Only the difference ϕ = ˜φ − φ = φ (x2/2 − vt) degree of freedom propagates throughout the system. • For ˜v = −v, we are able to ﬁx A1 = φ and ˜A1 = ˜φ. In this fashion, the resulting theory is Sedge = N 4π ∫ dtdl1 ˜φ (vD1 − D0) φ − φ (−vD1 − D0) ˜φ = N 2π ∫ dtdl1 ˜φ (vD1 − D0) φ. (7.32) The boundary action describes two opposite propagating degrees of freedoms φ(x2/2 + vt) and ˜φ(x2/2 − vt). Generalized derivative operators EFTs Modiﬁcations in the structure of the derivative operator which appears in the CS or BF theories may give rise to restricted mobility, and consequently, fracton phenomenology. This were the case of the 2D Type-I model (7.10) previously studied, where we considered second order derivative operators. In this section we generalize such model and consider D1 ≡ ∂n 1 , D2 ≡ ∂n 2 for n ∈ N and D0 ≡ ∂t. (7.33) In this fashion, the action deﬁned on compact manifolds S = − N 4π ∫ d2xdt [(−1)n A1 (D0 A2 − D2 A0) + (−1)n A2 (D1 A0 − D0 A1) +A0 (D1 A2 − D2 A1)] , (7.34) 68 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach describes a gapped system and remains invariant under gauge transformations Ai → Ai + Diλ and A0 → A0 + D0λ. (7.35) In the charged sector of the theory, it presents the conserved charges QP = ∫ d2xJ0(x, t)P(x), (7.36) for P(x) an arbitrary polynomial of degree n − 1. The extra conserved charges associated to the polynomials are closely related to the conservation of multipole moments, highly discussed in the context of fractonic order [15]. To see it, we introduce charged matter ﬁelds Θ = ρeiφ through a matter theory Lmatter. If the shift transformations on the phase δφ = λIa a PIa a (x), (7.37) for distinct polynomials PIa a (x), are continuous symmetries of Lmatter then the quantities (7.36) are their associated Noether charge [38]. For the case in which the polynomials are homoge- neous PIa a (x) = ∑ µIa i1i2...ia xi1 xi2 · · · xia, (7.38) the conserved charges are the components of multipole moments QIa = ∫ d2x ∂Lmatter ∂ (∂0φ) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ ρ(x) ∆φIa = ∑ ∫ d2xµIa i1i2...ia xi1 xi2 · · · xia ρ(x). (7.39) The CS-like theories with derivative operators (7.33) conserve all the 2a−pole moments, for a ≤ n − 1. They describe Type-I fracton systems with line operators W ∼ ei ∫ Aidxi , (7.40) which are able to move 2n−1-pole bound states. We can also consider more general derivative operators, e.g. D1 = ∂2 1 + ∂2 2 and D2 = ∂1∂2, (7.41) which are able to annihilate the polynomial f (x, y) = a (x2 1 − x2 2) + bx1 + cx2 + d. (7.42) The additional structure x2 − y2 of the above expression in comparison to (7.15) ensures the conservation not only of the dipole moment, but also the diagonal elements of the quadrupole moment Qij = ∫ d2x (2xixj − ⃗x · ⃗xδij) ρ(x). (7.43) This extra conservation law restricts, still more, the mobility of the dipole bound states. As we will argument, they can only move along horizontally or vertically oriented directions. 7.2. X-Cube Model 69 The gauge invariant line operators ei ∫ dx1 A2 and ei ∫ dx2 A2 create lineons dipole bound states at their ends. To see it, we investigate the excitations above the ground state created by an external source Jµ. It is useful to note that J0 |0⟩ = 0, that is, there are no excitations at the vacuum and that [eiA2(⃗x), J0 ( ⃗x′)] = N 2π [eiA2(⃗x), D1 A2 − D2 A1 ( ⃗x′)] = − N 2π D′ 2 [eiA2(⃗x), A1 ( ⃗x′)] = −iD′ 2 δ δA2 (⃗x′) eiA2(⃗x) = (∂1′ ∂2′ ) δ ( ⃗x − ⃗x′) eiA2(⃗x). (7.44) In this fashion, by discretizing the two-dimensional space into a square lattice with a “lattice spacing\" a, we see that the eiA2 operator creates four excitations above the vacuum J0 ( ⃗x′) eiA2(⃗x)|0⟩ = − 1 a2 (δ(x1 − x′ 1 − a) − δ(x1 − x′ 1)) × (δ(x2 − x′ 2 − a) − δ(x2 − x′ 2)) eiA2(⃗x)|0⟩. (7.45) The Figure 7.6 (a) shows, in units of 1/a2, the charge distribution created by eiA2(x). In addition, the Figure 7.6 (b) illustrates how the application of this operator in consecutive sites can move the dipoles around. In order to move the dipole excitations the line operators must be either horizontally or vertically oriented, reﬂecting the extra quadrupole conservation law. FIGURE 7.6: (a) The application of the eiA2(x) above the ground state creates four punctual charges. (b) A string of the operator eiA2 is able to move the dipole bound states along a line. 7.2 X-Cube Model In Section 4, we have studied the lattice description of the X-Cube model. A natural ques- tion that arises is: are we able to write down a continuum ﬁeld theory that captures the phe- nomenology of such model? In this section we will see that it is possible to ﬁnd such EFT, which resembles a CS topological ﬁeld theory. In this discussion, we mainly follow Ref [16]. Let us consider the ZN generalization of the X-Cube model (See Appendix A for a review of ZN Pauli operators). The Hamiltonian is given by ˆHX−cube = − ∑ ℓ ( ˆBℓ + ˆB† ℓ ) − ∑ ℓ,a ( ˆA(a) ℓ + ˆA(a)† ℓ ) , (7.46) 70 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach where ℓ = (x, a) denotes a link in the 3D lattice in terms of the site x and the direction a = 1, 2, 3. The operators ˆBℓ and ˆAℓ are the ZN cube and star analogous of (4.1) and are deﬁned according to Figure 7.7. FIGURE 7.7: ZN cube and star operators of the X-Cube model. Source: Adapted from [16]. The process of ﬁnding the X-Cube model EFT is very similar to the process we developed in Chapter 3 for the Toric Code and Wen Plaquette model. The lattice degrees of freedom are roughly given in terms of real-valued U(1) continuum variables ˆZx,a(t) ∼ exp (i ∫ ′ a Za(t, x)) , ˆXx,a(t) ∼ exp (i ∫ ′′ ⊥a Xa(t, x)) , ˆBx(t) ∼ exp ( 2πi N ∫ ′ i0(t, x)) , ˆA(a) x (t) ∼ exp ( 2πi N ∫ ′′ j0;a(t, x)) . (7.47) In the above relations, we introduced continuum sources i0 and j0,a for cube and star excitations. Roughly, the integral ∫ ′ a is performed over the link ℓ = (x, a), and ∫ ′′ ⊥a is performed on the dual plaquette, orthogonal to ℓ = (x, a). Finally, ∫ ′ integrates over the cube centered at x and ∫ ′′ integrates over the plaquette centered at x and orthogonal to a. In j0;a, the semicolon is used to indicate that the a index does not transform under spacetime transformations. The ZN Pauli algebra implies nontrivial equal-time commutation relations between Z and X ﬁelds [Za(t, x), Xb (t, x′)] = 2πi N δb a δ3 (x − x′) . (7.48) From the operators ˆAx and ˆBx operators and the deﬁnitions in (7.47), we see that i0= N 2π ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ0abc∣ ∣ ∣ 1 2 ∂a∂bZc and j0;a= N 2π ∑ b,c ϵ0abc∂cXc. (7.49) We can immediately construct a theory which is able to give the above relations (7.48) and (7.49) as ˜LX−cube = N 2π Xa∂0Za + X0 N 2π ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ0abc∣ ∣ ∣ 1 2 ∂a∂bZc + Z0;a N 2π ϵ0abc∂cXc − Z0;a j0;a − Za ja − X0i0 − Xaia. (7.50) 7.2. X-Cube Model 71 The ﬁrst term is responsible to lead to (7.48) under quantization, while the X0 and Z0;a terms are responsible to ensure (7.49) through Lagrange multipliers. The other two terms Za ja and Xaia are generic coupling of the Z and X ﬁelds. The lattice constraint ∏a ˆA(a) = 1 implies ∑a j0;a = 0, which follows directly from the deﬁnition (7.49). It also implies that the multipliers obey ∑a Z0;a = 0. In order to write (7.50) in a more familiar way, let us redeﬁne the ﬁelds as A0;a ≡ Z0;a, J0;a ≡ j0;a, Aa ≡ Za, Ja ≡ ja, B0 ≡ X0, I0 ≡ i0, Bab ≡ |ϵ0abc| Xc, I ab ≡ ∣ ∣ϵ0abc∣ ∣ ic, Xa ≡ ∣ ∣ϵ0abc∣ ∣ 1 2 Bbc, ia ≡ |ϵ0abc| 1 2 Ibc. (7.51) In terms of such variables, the EFT for the X-cube model is given by SX−Cube = N 2π ∫ d4x (∣ ∣ ∣ϵ0abc∣ ∣ ∣ 1 2 Bab∂0 Ac + B0 ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ0abc∣ ∣ ∣ 1 2 ∂a∂b Ac + A0;aϵ0abc∂cBab ) − ∫ d4x (A0;a J0;a + Aa Ja + B0 I0 + Bab 1 2 I ab) , (7.52) with the constraint ∑a A0;a = 0. The conserved charges ∫ x′ I0(t, x′) and ∫ x′ J0;b(t, x′) induce a local transformation on the ﬁelds Bab(t, x) → Bab(t, x) + i ∫ x′ [Bab(t, x), N 2π ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ0cde∣ ∣ ∣ 1 2 ∂′ c∂′ d Ae (t, x′) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ I0(t,x′) ]χ (t, x′) = Bab + ∂a∂bχ (7.53) Aa(t, x) → Aa(t, x) + i ∫ x′ [Aa(t, x), N 2π ϵ0bcd∂′ dBbc (t, x′) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ J0;b(t,x′) ]ζb (t, x′) = Aa − ϵ0abc∂aζc. (7.54) Provided that the Lagrange multipliers transform as A0;a → A0;a + ∂0ζa , B0 → B0 + ∂0χ and the currents satisfy appropriate conservation laws (see below), the theory (7.52) is gauge invariant. In order to the constraint on A0;a be consistent, we must have ∑a ζa = 0. We see that the EFT for the X-Cube model resembles a topological BF theory, but with slight differences. This is appropriate since, the topological robustness of fracton phases require a topological description but its UV sensitivity forbids the EFT to be an absolute TQFT. Conservation Laws Let us investigate how the conservation laws impose restrictions on the excitations mobility. The conservation laws for the currents I and J are ∂0 I0 − 1 2 ∂a∂b I ab = 0 (7.55) ∂0 J0;a + ϵ0abc∂c Jc = 0. (7.56) 72 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach The EFT does capture the lattice fracton creation phenomenology. Indeed, the current I0 = ∑ µ,ν=±1 µνθ(t)δ(x − µa)δ(y − νa)δ(z), I12 = δ(t)θ(a + x)θ(a − x)θ(a + y)θ(a − y)δ(z), I23 = I13 = 0 (7.57) describes the creation process of four fracton excitations at t = 0 at the positions x = (±a, ±a, 0). Note that I12 is non-zero only for t = 0, which is when the process takes place. Analogously, the current which describes a z-lineon moving along the z-axis is given by J0;1 = −J0;2 = J3/v = δ(x)δ(y)δ(z − vt), J0;3 = J1 = J2 = 0. (7.58) The fusion rules between star excitations (5.23) is also recovered by the EFT. Let us consider both an x- and an y-lineon at the origin J0;b = ∑ a=1,2 ∑ c=1,2,3 ϵ0abcδ(x)δ(y)δ(z) and Jb = 0. (7.59) We see that, performing the sum, it is equivalent to a z−lineon J0;b = − ∑ c ϵ03bcδ(x)δ(y)δ(z). (7.60) It is possible to show that the ground state degeneracy can be recovered by the EFT and is a generalization of (4.4) to the ZN case. Since the continuum ﬁeld theory (7.52) has an inﬁnite ground state degeneracy, we regularize it by introducing a short-distance cutoff a. The topo- logical operators with nontrivial commutation relations on a L1 × L2 × L3 3-torus allow us to count the ground state space dimension logN DGS = 2L1/a + 2L2/a + 2L3/a − 3. (7.61) The −3 factor comes from a redundancy between the topological operators, analogously to (4.6). Further details of the calculations can be found in [16]. 7.3 Chamon Code In Section 6.2 we discussed an effective ﬁeld theory with the potential to describe the low- energy physics of the Chamon code. The EFT was proposed based in general arguments of operators relevance, symmetries and conservation laws. In the work presented in [18], a gener- alization for odd dimensions of the Chamon code is presented, as well as a precise way to ﬁnd the continuous descriptions of the lattice models. In this section we review their construction and use an explicit map between the lattice and continuum degrees of freedom in order to ﬁnd a EFT for Chamon code in 3 dimensions. We map the Pauli operators Pi ⃗x deﬁned in the microscopic model to continuous ﬁelds Aa(⃗x) as Pi ⃗x = exp(iti aKab Ab(⃗x)), (7.62) 7.3. Chamon Code 73 with K = (Kab) a 2 × 2 invertible matrix to be determined and ti = (ti a) = (ti 1, ti 2) three two- component vectors for i = 1, 2, 3. Because Pauli operators ‘redundancies’ X⃗xY⃗x ∼ Z⃗x, the t vectors must satisfy ∑3 j=1 tj a = 0. We choose ti a = δi a, for i, a = 1, 2 and t3 a = −1 for a = 1, 2. (7.63) In order to this map hold, the Ai(⃗x) ﬁelds must replicate the Pauli matrices algebra. Let x, y ∈ Λeven Pi ⃗xPj ⃗y = exp(iti aKab Ab(⃗x)) exp(itj cKcd Ad(⃗y)). (7.64) Using the BCH theorem and imposing that the resulting commutator is a c-number eAeB = e[A,B]eBeA we have Pi ⃗xPj ⃗y = exp(−[ti aKab Ab(⃗x), tj cKcd Ad(⃗y)])Pj ⃗yPi ⃗x. (7.65) The different Pauli operators must commute for different sites ⃗x and ⃗y, but anti commute for ⃗x = ⃗y. In order this to be true in the Ai(⃗x) picture, we demand that [ti aKab Ab(⃗x), tj cKcd Ad(⃗y)] = iπδ⃗x⃗y ⇒ [Ab(⃗x), Ad (⃗y)] ≡ πi (K−1) bd δ⃗x⃗y, (7.66) together with the condition that ti a (KT) ab tj b = { 1 mod 2, i ̸= j 0 mod 2, i = j. (7.67) The commutation relation between the A1 and A2 ﬁelds can be thought as the canonical com- mutation relation at equal times, ensuring that the momentum conjugated to the Aa(⃗x) ﬁeld is Πa(⃗x) = 1 π (KT)ab Ab. (7.68) The general idea is to replace the Pauli operators in the microscopic model (4.9) for two independent ﬁelds A1(⃗x) and A2(⃗x). The octahedron operators (4.8) at the site ⃗x are translated in the ﬁeld theory counterpart as S⃗x = exp i ( 3 ∑ j=1 tj aKab Ab ( ⃗x + ˆxj) + tj aKab Ab ( ⃗x − ˆxj)) . (7.69) Since this operator involves the product of the Pauli operators in different sites, which trivially commute with each other, the BCH formula is not needed in order to arrange all the A ﬁelds in the same exponential argument. The exactly solvable character of the microscopic model is one of the key aspects of the theory, which follows the trivial commutation among all octahedron operators. In the EFT, this impose restrictions on the matrix K. Let us consider two sites ⃗x and ⃗x + ˆxi + ˆxj, with i ̸= j belonging to Λodd. In this case, the octahedron operators S⃗x and S⃗x+ ˆxi+ ˆxj share two sites: the site at ⃗x + ˆxi and the one at ⃗x + ˆxj. 74 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach Imposing that [S⃗x, S⃗x+ ˆxi+ ˆxj ] = 0, follows from (7.69) Cij = ti aKabtj b + tj aKabti b ≡ 0 (7.70) For the case in witch i = j, it is zero automatically from (7.67) and tell us that K11 = K22 = 0. For the case in which i ̸= j it gives us information about the off-diagonal elements. For i = 1 and j = 2 we see that K12 = −K21. Thus, the K matrix is an anti symmetric 2 × 2 matrix, which we write as K = ( 0 k −k 0 ) and K−1 = ( 0 − 1 k 1 k 0 ) . (7.71) We now take the continuum limit of the model. Let a be the lattice spacing length and let us replace the unitary vectors ˆxi that measures the distances between sites by⃗ai = (a1 i , a2 i , a3 i ) ≡ a ˆxi. In the continuum limit a → 0 we Taylor expand the Ab ﬁelds in the ⃗x ±⃗aj sites: Ab ( ⃗x ±⃗aj) = Ab(⃗x) ± ∑ i ai j∂i Ab + 1 2 ∑ i,k ai jak j ∂i∂K Ab + · · · . (7.72) Higher orders of derivatives are suppressed by higher powers of a. Let us replace the ﬁeld expansion and the components for the ⃗ai vectors aj i = aδj i in (7.69) S⃗x = exp i ( 3 ∑ j=1 tj aKab∂2 j Ab + · · · ) . (7.73) All the terms with odd order in derivatives cancel due to the contributions of Ab(⃗x +⃗aj) and Ab(⃗x −⃗aj) in (7.69). The zero-th order term is canceled due to the condition that ∑j tj a = 0: 2 3 ∑ j=1 tj aKab Ab (⃗x) = 2Kab Ab(⃗x) 3 ∑ j=1 ti a = 0. (7.74) Thus, in the continuum limit, the Hamiltonian (4.9) becomes ˆH = −h ∑ ⃗x∈Γodd (S⃗x + S† ⃗x) ⇒ H ∼ −2h ∫ d3x cos M(⃗x), (7.75) with the operator M(⃗x), in dominant order, deﬁned as M(⃗x) ≡ 3 ∑ j=1 tj aKab∂2 j Ab(⃗x). (7.76) To explicitly show the gauge invariance this model possesses, it is useful to write the M(⃗x) operator as M(⃗x) = 2 ∑ j=1 tj aKab∂2 j Ab(⃗x) − Kab∂2 3 Ab(⃗x) = Kab 2 ∑ j=1 tj a (∂2 j − ∂2 3) Ab(⃗x) = KabDa Ab(⃗x), (7.77) 7.3. Chamon Code 75 where we used t3 a = −1 from the ﬁrst to the second line and deﬁned the differential operator Da ≡ ∑2 j=1 tj a (∂2 j − ∂2 3). The continuous model, deﬁned in (7.75) depends only on the M(⃗x) operator, which depends on the Ab ﬁelds only through the relation (7.77). Due to the anti-symmetry of the K matrix, this theory is invariant under the gauge transformation Aa → Aa + Daλ, ⇒ M → KabDa Ab + KabDaDbλ → KabDa Ab(⃗x) = M. (7.78) We consider only the dominant terms in the Ab(⃗x) ﬁeld expansion (7.72) since we are inter- ested only in the low-energy physics of the theory. By the same reason, we consider only the ﬁeld conﬁgurations that maximize the cosine function, i.e., minimize the Hamiltonian energy function. These ﬁeld conﬁgurations obey M(⃗x) = 2πm, m ∈ Z. (7.79) We are ensure our EFT describes the low-energy physics of the Chamon code enforcing the previous relation through a Lagrange multiplier A0. The Lagrangian can be found by Legendre transforming the Hamiltonian L = Πa∂0 Aa − H. (7.80) The Hamiltonian density is given in the integral argument of (7.75) and the conjugated mo- mentum is given in (7.68). Thus L = 1 π (K)ab Aa∂0 Ab + 2A0 (KabDa Ab − 2πm) (7.81) The low-energy effective theory is then S = ∫ d3xdt 1 2π [Kab Aa∂0 Ab + 2A0 (KabDa Ab − 2πm)] . (7.82) The requirement that the theory is gauge invariant, up to boundary terms, of the theory is that the Lagrange multiplier transforms as A0 → A0 + ∂0λ. (7.83) The charged sector of this theory is associated to the coupling A0m, with m = 0 being the zero charge sector. The theory we obtained is a Chern-Simons like action, deﬁned in three spatial dimensions. In terms of the gauge-invariant electric and magnetic ﬁelds Ea = ∂0 Aa − Da A0 and B = D1 A2 − D2 A1, the action becomes S = ∫ d3xdt k 2π [A1E2 − A2E1 + A0B] , [A1(⃗x), A2 ( ⃗x′)] = − πi k δ⃗x,⃗x′. (7.84) This is exactly the EFT for the Chamon code presented at the work [17] which we discussed in section 3.113. To completely compare both theories, we redeﬁne A1 → −A2, A2 → A1, D1 → −D2, and D2 → D1 and identify k = s/2. 76 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach Conservation Laws As mentioned previously, the conserved quantities in the effective ﬁeld theory are the charges in certain planes. With our modiﬁed derivative operator, in order to keep the theory gauge in- variant, the current must obey ∂0 J0 − Da Ja = 0. (7.85) It gives us a conserved charge not only in the whole system dQ dt = d dt ∫ d3xJ0 = ∫ d3xDa Ja = 0, (7.86) but also in some speciﬁc planes. Let σi = ±1 and ⃗uσ1 1 = ˆx1 + σ1 ˆx3 and ⃗uσ2 2 = ˆx2 + σ2 ˆx3 face- diagonals coordinates. Integrating on any of the four plans d dt ∫ duσ1 1 duσ2 2 J0 = ∫ duσ1 1 duσ2 2 Da Ja = ∫ duσ1 1 duσ2 2 (∂2 1 − ∂2 3) J1 + (∂2 2 − ∂2 3) J2 = ∫ duσ1 1 duσ2 2 (∂u1+ ∂u1− ) J1 + (∂u2+ ∂u2− ) J2 = 0, (7.87) where we have used the explicit deﬁnition of Da operators and written ∂ui± = ∂2 i ± ∂2 3. The perpendicular directions of such planes ⃗uσ1 1 × ⃗uσ2 2 = −σ1 ˆx1 − σ2 ˆx2 + ˆx3 (7.88) are the cube-diagonal vectors ⃗t = {[111], [¯111], [1¯11], [¯1¯11]}. The conserved charges along the perpendicular planes Σ⃗t = {−σ1x1 − σ2x2 + x3 = cte} in this continuous ﬁeld description are exactly the topological charges (4.14) in the lattice model. Note that the dipole momentum ⃗P = ∫ Σ⃗t J0⃗t in any ⃗t cube-diagonal direction is conserved along the planes Σ⃗t, ∂0⃗P = ∫ Σ⃗t ∂0 J0⃗t = ∫ Σ⃗t (Da Ja)⃗t (7.89) = ∫ duσ1 1 duσ2 2 Da(Ja⃗t) = 0, (7.90) where we used that the Da derivatives act on the orthogonal planes to⃗t and Da⃗t = 0 for a = 1, 2. Ground State Degeneracy As a check consistency of our description, we recover the ground state degeneracy (4.10) in the effective low-energy description. In the continuum limit L → ∞, the ground state is inﬁnitely degenerate. We regularize this divergence by reintroducing the lattice spacing length a in a convenient way. We take advantage of the conservation laws in the Σ⃗t sub manifolds and discretize our model as stacks of such cube-diagonal perpendicular planes. Basically, we think of it as a collection of four 2d planar systems stacked along a cubic diagonal line. In the action (7.82), we discretize the transverse direction. For this, we perform the variables change (x1, x2, x3) → (uσ 1 , uσ 2 , x⊥) , (7.91) 7.3. Chamon Code 77 with x⊥ being the cube-diagonal variable, normal to the planes uσ1 1 uσ2 2 . In order to discretize this direction, we introduce the lattice distance a, where the distance between two planes in the stack is 2a ∫ dx⊥ → N ∑ i=1 2a. (7.92) In this way, the action (7.82) becomes a sum in N Aa ﬁelds, corresponding to their respective layer. That is, we have a bunch of 2 + 1 dimensional theories S = N ∑ i=1 ∫ dtdxσ1 13dxσ2 23 k π Ai 1∂0 Ai 2 + · · · . (7.93) In order to get rid of the 2a factor, we have properly scaled the gauge ﬁelds Aa (t, uσa a , x⊥) → 1√2a Ai a (t, uσa a ), so that now [Ai a] = 1. In this parametrization, L = 2a × N. In the following, to be compatible with our previous discussion in section 4.2 we set a = 1. Note that, for each one of the N two-dimensional systems, due to the periodic boundaries conditions, we have a T2 torus. The nontrivial topology of the lattice allows large gauge trans- formations. Namely, the gauge transformation implemented by ζi = 2πni 1 li u+ 1 u− 1 + 2πni 2 li u+ 2 u− 2 , ni 1, ni 2 ∈ Z, (7.94) give us the transformation for the Ai a ﬁelds as Ai 1 ∼= Ai 1 + 2π li mi 1 and Ai 2 ∼= Ai 2 + 2π li mi 2, mi 1, mi 2 ∈ Z. (7.95) The holonomy operators exp (i ∮ li 0 duσ1 1 Ai 1 ) and exp (i ∮ li 0 duσ2 2 Ai 2 ) (7.96) where li the linear dimension of the i−th torus, are gauge invariant even under large trans- formations. The holonomies are the relevant degrees of freedom in low-energy physics and provide us a way to count the ground state degeneracy. The CS-like theory (7.93) for each plane is completely gapped. There is no propagating degrees of freedom in the spectrum and he physics of the model relies on global aspects. That is why we are interested in the “global” holonomies degrees of freedom. By the same reason, we are interested in the zero modes solutions Ai a (t, u+ 1 , u− 2 ) = 1 li ¯Ai a(t), (7.97) which reﬂects the topological aspects of the theory. In terms of these solutions, the action becomes S = N ∑ i=1 ∫ dt k π ¯Ai 1∂0 ¯Ai 2. (7.98) 78 Chapter 7. Fracton Effective Theories: Top-Down Approach The commutation rule for each plane variable is [ ¯Ai 1, ¯Aj 2] = − iπ k δij. (7.99) The associated holonomies in the i-th plane ei ¯Ai 1 and ei ¯Ai 2 obey ei ¯Ai 1 ei ¯Ai 2 = ei ¯Ai 2 ei ¯Ai 1 e iπ k , (7.100) which implies a 2k-fold degeneracy for each plane i. In our regularization, there are 4N independent Σ⃗t planes (N for each one of the four cube- diagonals), so that the total system ground state degeneracy is GSD = (2k)4N = 2 2L. (7.101) We set k = 1 and replaced N = L/2. This successfully recover the result in (4.11). 79 Chapter 8 Final Remarks and Perspectives In this work we have studied and developed several methods that are quite useful to inves- tigate certain topologically ordered systems, as QSL and fracton models. To brieﬂy summarize the main points of the work, within the context of QSL, we studied two exactly solvable lattice models, the Toric Code and the Wen Plaquette model. We were able to ﬁnd the corresponding effective descriptions that properly capture the low-energy properties. Moreover, we studied in some details the three-dimensional lattice models X-Cube and Chamon codes, as well as their EFTs, and also discussed general aspects of fractonic ﬁeld theories. In addition, we pro- posed and explored an exactly solvable 2D Type-I fracton model both in the lattice as in the continuum. Most of the studies carried in this thesis dealt with Type-I fracton models, which are more abundant in examples than the Type-II ones. Nevertheless, Type-II fracton systems are the sub- ject of great interest, not only due their potential technological applications, but also because of their even more intriguing physical properties. In particular, the study of Type-II fractonic ﬁeld theories is in its initial stage and in developing process. We do expect that the methods discussed here can be directly applied to the study of Type-II fracton lattice models that are given in terms of commuting projectors, as in the case of the Haah code and the model dis- cussed in Ref. [40]. Although the latter model is not strictly a Type-II fracton, since it contains lineons along one direction, it presents Type-II phenomenology in a submanifold and still is written in terms of commuting projectors. These investigations are currently in progress. To conclude, it is worth to stress that the methods developed along this work pave the way for the investigation of several open questions. Among them, we would like to highlight the following: i) the study of layer construction from the perspective of continuum descriptions along the lines of Ref. [41]; ii) investigation of the duality relations between the BF-like theories and Higgsed higher-rank gauge theories; iii) full classiﬁcation of the 2 + 1 dimensional frac- ton systems; iv) construction of non-Abelian fractonic phases; v) extension of the commuting projectors formalism for the case of non-exactly solvable models. 81 Appendix A ZN Pauli Operators In this work we make use of the generalized ZN “clock” Z and “shift” X Pauli operators. They satisfy XZ = ωZX with ω = e 2πi N (A.1) and ZN = XN = I. In opposition to the N = 2 case, where we have the usual Pauli matrices σz and σx algebra, such operators are not Hermitian and have eigenvalues 1, ω, · · · , ωN−1. They can be represented as N × N unitary matrices Zxi =        1 0 . . 0 0 e 2πi N 0 . 0 . . . . . . . . . 0 0 . . . e 2π(N−1)i N        and X =       0 1 0 . 0 0 0 1 0 0 . . . . . 0 0 . 0 1 1 0 . . 0       . (A.2) For future purposes, it is useful to investigate how time-reversal transforms the ZN oper- ators. It is implemented by an anti-unitary transformation T = U ˆK and T −1 = ˆKU† with U unitary and ˆK the complex conjugation operator. It transforms (A.1) as T XZT −1 = T ωZXT −1 ⇒ T XT −1 ︸ ︷︷ ︸ X′ T ZT −1 ︸ ︷︷ ︸ Z′ = ω∗T ZT −1T XT −1 ⇒ X′Z′ = ω∗Z′X′, (A.3) where we have used that T ω = ω∗T . We can explicit ﬁnd the ZN operators transformations generalizing the Z2 case qU = eiδσy where a physical spin 1/2 transforms T : ˆSi = σi/2 ↦→ − ˆSi. Deﬁne Y = iXZ, then under time reversal T = eiαXZ ˆK X → X′ = T XT −1 = ω∗X and Z → Z′ = T ZT −1 = ω∗Z†, (A.4) where we have used the algebra XZ† = ω∗Z†X, that ˆKX ˆK = X and ˆKZ ˆK = Z†. This represen- tation for T transformation successfully reproduces (A.3). 83 Bibliography [1] David Gross et al. “Quantum ﬁelds and strings. A course for mathematicians”. In: 1999. Chap.
