Use intuitive reasoning (not a mathematical proof) to answer the following. 1.ls it guaranteed that A N C'is independent from B¢ N D? « Answer: s 2.1s it guaranteed that A N B N D is independent from B¢ U D? X Answer: No Solution: 1. The occurrence of event A N C contains information about A and C, but provides no information on the occurrence of B, D, or for that matter, B¢ N D. Hence we have independence. 2. Event D influences both of the events A M B* N D and B¢ U D¢, and therefore introduces a dependence between them. For a more concrete argument, if we are told that event AN B¢ N D occurs, then we know that D occurred. Therefore, D° did not occur, and this generally reduces the probability of event B U D¢.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
