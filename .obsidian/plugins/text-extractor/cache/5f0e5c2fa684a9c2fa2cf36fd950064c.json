Elitzur’s theorem In the previous chapters we have considered phase transitions in models with a global symmetry that showed a phase transition, i.e. spontaneous breaking of their global symmetry as a function of temperature or by changing a coupling constant. Here we will start the discussion of the possible phases, when the global symmetry is raised to a local one, that is, when the symmetry operation that leaves the Hamiltonian invariant is not the same on all points of the lattice but can be diﬀerent from point to point. The easiest model where we can study such a situation is the Ising model, in the form introduced by Wegner [1]. 3.1 Ising model with a local Z2 symmetry We consider a hypercubic lattice in d-dimensional Euclidean space (or space-time if we happen to have a quantum mechanical model, as already shown for the Ising model with transverse ﬁeld). The sites of the lattice are labeled by an index n. At each lattice point there are 2d links connecting it to the nearest neighbor sites. We label the links by (n, µ), where µ is a unit lattice vector pointing in the direction of the link. The same link can be also labeled (n + µ, −µ). We deﬁne the model so, that now our Z2 variables (we call them as before spins) are sitting on the links The next step is to deﬁne an operation that is local. In the case of the glocal Z2 symmetry of the Ising model we made the change Si → −Si ∀ i. Here we have spins σ(n, µ) and introduce a local gauge transformation G(n) by ﬂipping all the spins on links connected to site n. Figure 5 shows an example on a two dimensional lattice, Figure 5: Gauge transformation on the central site. All the spins on the links touching the central site are ﬂipped. where the gauge transformation is performed at the central site of the ﬁgure. Finally, we need an action that deﬁnes the statistical weight for the spin conﬁgu- rations, and is invariant under the gauge transformation. The following form fulﬁlls A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 20 those conditions: S = −J ∑ n,µν σ(n, µ) σ(n + µ, ν) σ(n + µ + ν, −µ) σ(n + ν, −ν) . (3.1) Although our example in Fig. 5 shows a two dimensional lattice, the action above is deﬁned for arbitrary dimensions. The gauge invariance of the action can be seen in Fig. 5. Since the gauge transformation ﬂips two spins in each plaquette with a vertex at the site of the transformation, the product in each plaquette in (3.1) does change. Certainly, it would be possible to consider diﬀerent forms for the action that are also gauge invariant. The form given above is the one where the interaction is as local as possible. Due to the gauge invariance of the action, many conﬁgurations are gauge equiv- alent, i.e. all those conﬁgurations that can be reached from a given one through gauge transormations. In order to discern which conﬁgurations change the value of the action, we can recall the situation in the case of the ordinary Ising model. There, we looked at the conﬁguration of each bond, where the product SiSj was invariant under a global Z2 transformation. Depending on the conﬁguration, we had there the two possible values ±1. However, such a quantity is not gauge invariant. Instead, we can take the product of the spins in a plaquette with the two possible values ±1: ∏ i∈p σi = ±1 , (3.2) where we denote with p a given plaquette. In this way we can distinguish conﬁgu- rations with diﬀerent energies. Once we can distinguish conﬁgurations by their energy, the question arises, whether a phase transition can take place, as in the ordinary Ising model, that is, with a spontaneous symmetry breaking. We will see in the next section, that by virtue of Elitzur’s theorem, this cannot happen. 3.2 Elitzur’s theorem Spontaneous symmetry breaking is in general characterized by the development of a non-vanishing value of an order parameter. In the case of the ordinary Ising model, we have seen that the magnetization serves as a local order parameter. We will therefore, consider the local magnetization in the case of the gauge invariant model. Although we will proove its vanishing only for the Ising gauge theory, more general proofs of Elitzur’s theorem [12] can be found in the book by Itzykson and Drouﬀe. In order to see whether there is spontaneous symmetry breaking, we switch on a small external magnetic ﬁeld h with a coupling h ∑ n,µ σ(n, µ) , (3.3) and compute ⟨σ(m, ν)⟩. We take the thermodynamic limit and then the limit h → 0. If the expectation value of σ does not vanish, then, there is spontaneous symmetry A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 21 breaking. The expectation value is ⟨σ(m, ν)⟩h = 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 22 3.3 Gauge invariant correlation functions Elitzur’s theorem shows that it is not possible to have a spontaneous breaking of local gauge symmetries, and hence, an order-parameter cannot be used to characterize the possible phases of the system. We have already seen the case of the XY-model, where due to Mermin-Wagner’s theorem, the continuous O(2) symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken, yet we have encountered two phases. One which we called the disordered phase, where the correlation function decays exponentially, and another one below TKT , the temper- ature at which the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition takes place, where the correlation function decays as a power law. Hence, although there is no order parameter, it is possible to distinguish diﬀerent phases by looking at appropriate correlation func- tions. One could also distinguish them by considering the correlation length. The disordered phase has a ﬁnite correlation length while the the phase with quasi-long range order has an inﬁnite correlation length. In the present case, Wegner proposed to look at gauge-invariant correlation func- tions. As we have seen already in the construction of a gauge-invariant action for the Ising model, a gauge-invariant quantity can be obtained by considering the product of spin variables along a closed path of links, ∏ ℓ∈C σ(ℓ) , (3.11) where the arguments of the spin variable denotes links and C is a closed contour. Two quantities related to C that are going to play an important role in the following are P , the perimeter of C, and A, the minimal area enclosed by C. We consider now high and low temperature expansions for the Ising gauge the- ory. High temperature expansions are part of the established tools in statistical mechanics. We are not going to review them here, but just apply it to the case of interest without use of any formal argument. For those interested in a more de- tailed account on high temperature expansions, the review article by Kogut and the references therin should be appropriate. 3.3.1 High temperature expansion Since the Boltzmann weight is an exponential, in the limit β → 0, we could directly expand the exponential in powers of the argument. However, due to the simplicity of the variables in our case, and due to the fact that [ ∏ ℓ∈p σ(ℓ) ]2 = 1 , (3.12) A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 23 we consider ﬁrst the Boltzmann weight on a plaquette, where we absorb the coupling constant J in the deﬁnition of temperature, and make a simple exact transformation: e βσσσσ = ∞∑ n=0 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 24 the links in the interior of C are paired. In general we can write 〈 ∏ ℓ∈C σ(ℓ)〉 = e −f (β)A , (3.18) where f (β) = − ln tanh β + · · · , (3.19) and A is the minimal area subtended by C. This is the celebrated area law that holds for ﬁnite but high temperatures. In the case of the ordinary Ising model, it can be proved that the high temperature expansion has a ﬁnite radius of convergence, and the same applies here. While we state this without demonstration, more information can be gathered in the review by Kogut. 3.3.2 Low temperature expansion Since we will see later that d = 2 is a special case, we start the discussion by considering d > 2. In the case of the ordinary Ising model, we know that the low temperature phase is the one with all spins pointing in the same direction. In the present case, we have the possibility of performing local gauge transformations, such that many other (in principle inﬁnite many in the thermodynamic limit) conﬁgurations can be generated from that one, without changing the energy of the system. It is therefore convenient to reduce this redundancy by taking representatives of classes deﬁned by those conﬁgurations that are gauge equivalent, that is the conﬁgurations that can be connected by a gauge transformation. Since we are computing gauge-invariant expectation values, by just considering one representative of a given class, the result does not depend on the particular representative. On summing over all possible conﬁgurations of spins, a common factor emerges for each class, that is taken care of by the normalization. Hence, after having chosen a representative for a gauge- invariant conﬁguration, we can speak of spin-ﬂips, as long as such changes do not correspond to a gauge transformation. In the limit β → ∞, it is clear that we maximize the Boltzmann weight by taking all spins equal, say σ = 1, and hence, we take this state as a representative of the state at T = 0. Then, the expansion at low temperatures can proceed by considering the number of ﬂipped spins. For the expectation value we have as allways 〈 ∏ ℓ∈C σ(ℓ)〉 = 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 25 Let us now ﬂip one spin. Since each link belongs to 2(d − 1) plaquettes, this gives the number of unsatisﬁed plaquettes, that we call frustrated. We call the weight of the conﬁguration with all spins up W↑ = e βNp , (3.22) where Np is the number of plaquettes in the system. Then, by considering the expansion in the number of ﬂipped spins we have Z A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 26 We discuss now the special features of the d = 2 case. As in the preceeding discussion, we ﬂip one spin on a given link, and as we mentioned already, there are going to be 2(d − 1) = 2 frustrated plaquettes. However, in this case it is possible to invert a line of spins and there are still only two plaquettes that are frustrated. Figure 6 displays an example showing that the frustrated plaquettes are at the end of the line of down spins. Hence, there is a special degeneracy in this case, where F F Figure 6: Example of a conﬁguration with two frustrated plaquettes denoted by F at the ends of the line of overturned spins. many conﬁgurations, independently of the number of overturned spins leads to the same action. We can learn more about this special case by looking at the gauge-invariant cor- relation function we deﬁned before. We consider a system in the thermodynamic limit and focus on the case where the line of overturned spins has one end at in- ﬁnity. This is in fact one of the possible degenerate conﬁgurations. There are two possibilities for the contour C of our correlation function. Either it contains the end of the overturned spins in its inside, or not. If not, at most an even number of spins on C are overturned since at most, the line of overturned spins enters and leaves the space enclosed by C. All these contributions will lead to the same value as in the case where no spin is inverted. On the other hand, if the end of the string of overturned spins is inside C, there is an odd number of inverted spins on C, leading to a negative contribution for the correlation function. We can sum over all possible conﬁgurations in a way similar to the low temperature expansion for d > 2. The result for the correlation function is 〈 ∏ ℓ∈C σ(ℓ)〉 = 1 + (N − 2NC) e −4β + · · · A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 27 where we set A ≃ NC/2. Hence, we obtain in this case the same as in the high tem- perature expansion, or equivalently, we do not see any signal of a phase transition. We can gain further insight into the result for the two dimensional case by viewing it as living in space-time of a one-dimensional model, where one direction is space-like with links denoted by ˆx and the other time-like, with links labeled by ˆτ . Since we are interested in gauge-invariant correlations, the results should be independent of a particular choice of gauge. We can then choose, i.e. ﬁx the gauge to our convenience. In this case we choose σ(n, ˆτ ) = 1 (3.31) for each temporal link. In fact, given any conﬁguration we can perform a gauge transformation such that the condition above is fulfulled. This is called the temporal gauge. The action in this gauge is S = −J ∑ n µ=ˆx,ˆτ σ(n, ˆx) σ(n + ˆτ , ˆx) . (3.32) In this gauge the couplings in the horizontal direction do not appear any more, such that a one-dimensional Ising model in the ˆτ direction results. Therefore we have the following remarkable relation: 2D Ising gauge theory = 1D Ising model As we discussed before, the one-dimensional Ising model is disordered at all ﬁnite temperatures. This conﬁrms our discussion, where we found an area law also at low temperatures for the gauge invariant correlation function. We can also evaluate the correlation function on a simple rectangular contour with a width R along the spatial and a height T along the temporal direction. Then, for the product of spins along the contour we have ∏ ℓ∈C σ(ℓ) = σ(0, 0, ˆx) σ(0, 1, ˆx) · · · σ(0, R, ˆx) ... ×σ(T, 0, ˆx) σ(T, 1, ˆx) · · · σ(T, R, ˆx) , (3.33) since all the vertical links are one. Since there is no interaction on the horizontal direction, we have the spin-spin correlation on the τ -direction R times. This means ⟨∏ ℓ∈C σ(ℓ)⟩ = ⟨σ(T, 0, ˆx) σ(0, 0, ˆx)⟩R ∼ e −T R/ξ = −A/ξ . (3.34) 3.4 Quantum Hamiltonian and duality transformation of the three-dimensional Ising gauge theory In order to deepen our understanding of the phases that can occur in the Ising gauge theory, we consider ﬁrst the mapping to a τ -continuum quantum mechanical Hamil- tonian, as we did in Sec. 2.2 for the anisotropic two-dimensional Ising model. As in A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 28 that case, we start by generalizing the action by considering anisotropic couplings: S = −Jτ ∑ pτ ∏ ℓ∈pτ σℓ − Js ∑ ps ∏ ℓ∈ps σℓ , (3.35) where we denote with pτ plaquettes containing links in the temporal direction and with ps plaquettes containing links only in the spatial direction. It is convenient to choose the temporal gauge, that was introduced at the end of the previous Sec. 3.3.2 linking the 2D Ising gauge theory and the 1D Ising model, and expressed in eq. (3.31). Although we ﬁxed the gauge, there is still a large set of local gauge operations under which the action is invariant, namely all τ -independent gauge transformations. In this case, given a site n on which the gauge transformation should be performed, all other sites with the same spatial coordinates along the time direction will be aﬀected. But this means that the spins are going to be ﬂipped twice on the temporal link, such that the condition (3.31) is respected. Then, the temporal part of the action above simpliﬁes as follows: −Jτ ∑ pτ σ(n, ˆx) σ(n + τ, ˆx) → Jτ A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 29 where now we have a pure spatial lattice two-dimensional lattice. Once we have reached a quantum mechanical description of the system, we can also look at the local symmetries of the theory in an operator formulation. An operator that ﬂips all the links emanating from a given site n is given by G(n) = ∏ ±ˆx σx(n, ˆx) . (3.41) This operator commutes with the ﬁrst term in (3.40), so that we need only to consider its action on the σz operator. There we have G−1(n) σz(n, ˆx) G(n) = −σz(n, ˆx) . (3.42) Then it follows that the Hamiltonian is invariant under such operation G−1(n) H G(n) = H , (3.43) that is, the Hamiltonian is gauge invariant. Elitzur’s theorem implies that the Hilber space is invariant to local gauge operations: G(n) | ψ⟩ =| ψ⟩ . (3.44) As a consequence, we can see explicitely that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not possible: ⟨ψ | σz(n, ˆx) | ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ | G(n) G−1(n) σz(n, ˆx) G(n) G−1(n) | ψ⟩ = −⟨ψ | σz(n, ˆx) | ψ⟩ , (3.45) such that ⟨ψ | σz(n, ˆx) | ψ⟩ = 0. As a consequence of the invariance (3.44), the operator G(n) can be viewed as the identity, such that σx(n, ˆy) σx(n, −ˆy) σx(n, ˆx) σx(n, −ˆx) = 1 . (3.46) We can use this property in order to reduce the number of operators that appear explicitely, since from the relation above, we can write σx(n, ˆy) = σx(n, ˆx) σx(n, −ˆx) σx(n, −ˆy) . (3.47) The last operator can be again written in terms of the operators on the links arriving at n − ˆy, such that σx(n, ˆy) = σx(n, ˆx) σx(n, −ˆx) σx(n − ˆy, ˆx) ×σx(n − ˆy, −ˆx) σx(n − ˆy, −ˆy) . (3.48) This means, that we can eliminate operators σx on links pointing in the y-direction by applying recursively (3.47). After having eliminated such operators from the Hamiltonian, we have to realize that the operators σz on those links, i.e. pointing A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 30 also in the y-direction commute with H, and hence, the expectation values of these operators are conserved quantities. Therefore, without altering the physics, we can choose them to be a constant σz(n, ˆy) = 1 . (3.49) As a result of the manipulations above, σx(n, ˆx) and σz(n, ˆx) are the only operators appearing explicitely in H. We can now deﬁne a duality transformation for the three-dimensional Ising gauge theory. As already performed in the case of the two-dimensional Ising model, we deﬁne adual lattice with sites at the center of the original lattice. On such sites we deﬁne further a ”dual spin-ﬂip” operator by µx(n ∗) = ∏ ℓ∈p σz(ℓ) , (3.50) where p is the plaquette associated with n ∗. A corresponding operator µz can also deﬁned as follows µz(n ∗) = ∏ n′≥0 σx(n − n ′ ˆy, ˆx) . (3.51) We have to see now, whether such deﬁnitions are consistent with the Pauli spin- algebra. First we can easily see that [µx(n ∗)] 2 = [µz(n ∗)] 2 = 1 . (3.52) Furthermore, for the anticommutator on the same site we have {µx(n ∗), µz(n ∗)} = 0 , (3.53) since, going back to the original operators, we see that there is only one link in common for the two dual opertors, such that on that link {σx(n, ˆx), σz(n, ˆx)} = 0, where n is a site on the original lattice (say at the lower left corner of the corre- sponding plaquette). Finally, we have to see whether these operators commute on diﬀerent sites. In fact, since a problem can only arise if both sites are on the same column along the y-direction, and µx involves the product of two operators σz on links along the x-direction, the commutator will involve two commutation operations of the original operators. Hence, [µx(n ∗), µz(m ∗)] = 0 , for n ∗ ̸= m ∗ . (3.54) Once we have seen that the mapping reproduces faithfully the spin algebra, we consider how to express the Hamiltonian with the new operators. From the deﬁnition (3.51) it clearly follows that µz(n ∗)µz(n ∗ − ˆy) = σx(n, ˆx) . (3.55) A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 31 On the other hand, µz(n ∗)µz(n ∗ − ˆx) = σ(n, ˆx)σ(n − ˆy, ˆx)σ(n − 2ˆy, ˆx) · · · ×σ(n − ˆx, ˆx)σ(n − ˆx − ˆy, ˆx)σ(n − ˆx − 2ˆy, ˆx) · · · = σ(n, ˆx)σ(n − ˆy, ˆx)σ(n − 2ˆy, ˆx) · · · ×σ(n, −ˆx)σ(n − ˆy, −ˆx)σ(n − 2ˆy, −ˆx) · · · = σx(n, ˆy) , (3.56) where the last equality comes from (3.48), when the recursion relation is used to eliminate σx(n − n ′ ˆy, ˆy) ∀ n > 0. Putting together all the pieces, we ﬁnally have H = − ∑ n∗,ℓ µz(n ∗)µz(n ∗ + ℓ) − λ ∑ n∗ µx(n ∗) = λ [ − ∑ n∗ µx(n ∗) − 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 32 as a kink operator. To see this we can think on the action of this operator on a fully ordered state with, say, all spins up. The operator above will ﬂip all the spins starting at the link (n, ˆx) down to the lowest link in the system. Its expectation value for large λ is zero, meaning that the state is free of kinks. Above the critical point, its expectation value is non-zero, a fact that can be understood as a kink condensate. Hence, such a state is characterized by topologically non-trivial objects, the kinks. In spite of its close connection to the local order parameter of the ordinary Ising model, the fact that the disorder parameter above acquires a non-vanishing value does not contradict Elitzur’s theorem, since it is non-local. Furthermore, considering the operator for local gauge transformations (3.41), we see that the expectation value obtained is gauge invariant since both operators commute. Finally, once we understand that the high temperature phase is a kink condensate, we can go back to the gauge invariant correlation function (3.11), and consider a purely spatial contour C. The fact that we have kinks, means that also frustrated plaquettes are present. Then, repeating the reasoning we had for the two-dimensional Ising gauge theory, we can arrive at the already discussed area law.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
