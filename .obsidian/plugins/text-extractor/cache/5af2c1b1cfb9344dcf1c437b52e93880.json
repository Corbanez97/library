Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 3 1Generalities on phase transitions Before entering into the subject of lattice gauge theory, letus recall some important aspects of phase transitions that will be repeatedly alludedto during this lecture. In fact, as we will see in later chapters, one of the initial motivations to develop a lattice gauge theory [1] was to address rather special phase transitions, where later, conﬁnement [2] became one of the more important aspects. In general phase transitions can be devided in those, where the state of the system changes in a discontinuous way, called ﬁrst order phase transitions,and continuous ones, where the correlation length of the degree of freedom undergoing the phase transition diverges. We will concentrate on continuous phase transitions. In general, a phase transition takes place when some intensive parameter like temperature is changed. Normally, the high temperature phase is a disordered one, with a high symmetry, and the phase transition brings the system to a lower symme- try phase. Here one speaks of a spontaneous symmetry breaking.Consequently, such aphenomenon is in general described in terms ofan order parameter.It is deﬁned such that it is zero in the disordered phase and non-zero in theordered one. In a ﬁrst order phase transition the change is discontinuous, as oppossed to a continuous phase transition. The point at which a continuous phase transition takes place is called the critical point,and one speaks about criticality due to the fact that the correlation length diverges such that physical quantities like, e.g. the magnetic susceptibility in a mag- net, diverge. This signals the fact that ﬂuctuations are present on all length scales, i.e. there is no physical length scale characterizing the system and the system be- comes scale invariant.This last fact makes the link between critical phenomena in statistical physics and elementary particle physics, wherea Lorentz-invariant theory with massless particles is also scale invariant. It turns out that three aspects characterize a critical point. The ﬁrst one is the number of components of the order parameter. It could be a scalar (zero compo- nents), a vector (n components, where n is the dimension of the space deﬁning the order parameter), etc. The second is the number of spatial dimensions d,where the system lives. The third one is the kind of symmetry that is broken. One big distinction is between discrete and continuous symmetries.Further distinctions are given by the symmetry groups of the high and low temperature phases. To see this in more detail let us review some models for magnetism, where the concepts related to the number of componentes of the order parameter n and the symmetry of the phases can be seen directly. We will dedicate later some time to study the Ising model.We can deﬁne it on a hypercubic lattice in d dimensions as follows: H = −J ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ SiSj , (1.1) where Si = ±1, and ⟨i, j⟩ denotes sites i and j that are nearest neighbors. We can make a transformation Si →−Si without changing the energy. Hence, the Hamiltonian has a global Z2 symmetry.This is a discrete symmetry. The order A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 4 parameter is in this case the magnetization that will be givenby ⟨Si⟩ = 1 Z ∑ {Sj } Si e K P⟨j,ℓ⟩ SjSℓ, (1.2) where Z is the partition function and K ≡ βJ,with β =1/kBT .It is easy to see that in the high temperature limit (K → 0), all possible conﬁgurations are equally probable, and hence ⟨Si⟩ =0. In the low temperature limit (K →∞)there are two conﬁgurations that maximize the exponent, namely all spin with Si =1, or all with Si = −1. The system has to choose one of these two degenerate states,such that the global Z2 symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the order parameter is non-zero. This is actually true only if we are in the thermodynamic limit and d ≥ 2. For d =1 it can be shown that the system is allways disordered. We can go to more general situations, where the spin is a vector. In the so-called XY-model we have Si =(Sx i ,Sy i ), with say S2 i =1. In this case the number of components is n =2. The Hamiltonian is now H = −J ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ Si · Sj , (1.3) Since applying the same O(2) rotation on each site, the energydoes not change, in this case the global symmetry is O(2) or U(1). As in the previous case, the high temperature phase is disordered, while we expect the low temperature phase to be ordered. We will see below that here again the spatial dimension d plays a very important role. Finally, we can have a Heisenberg-model,where Si =(Sx i ,Sy i ,Sz i ), again with S2 i =1. In this case the number of components is n =3. The Hamiltonian has the same form as for the XY-model but now the global symmetry isO(3). In the quantum case we would have SU(2) as the global symmetry. Untilnow no symmetry was playing any role in the symmetry broken phase. In this case, there is still a symmetry present in the low temperature phase. There, we expect all the spins to be pointing in one direction, i.e. we expect a colinear phase.But then, a rotation along that direction does not change the state, such that an O(2) or U(1) symmetry remains. The manifold of the order parameter is then the quotient O(3)/O(2) ≃ S2. This is telling us, that the low energy modes in the broken symmetry phase are two transverse ones. The fact that the system is scale invariant at the critical point leads to the concept of universality and universality classes.Since the system is scale invariant, microscopic details of the system become unimportant such that n, d,and the symmetries of the phases are the determining factors that characterize the transition. This is explicitely seen in the so-called critical exponents that acquire the same value if the systems belong to the same universality class. The critical exponents tell us e.g. how the magnetic susceptibility diverges at the transition. Such a generality leads to the possibility of having quite powerful mathematical theorems, where even without knowing the system in detail we can make very strong A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 5 statements about eventual phase transitions in them. One such theorem is the celebrated Mermin-Wagner theorem [3], that states that a continuous symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken in d ≤ 2at ﬁnite temperatures. This means that for the XY- or the Heisenberg-model discussed above, the local order parameter is zero for all temperatures T> 0. However, this does not mean that there is no phase transition. In fact, the XY-model shows a so-called Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) [4, 5, 6] transition. In this case the information abouta phase transition is not contained in the local order parameter but in correlationfunctions of it. Let us discuss in more detail the BKT transition, in order to see the diﬀer- ence between the phases with vanishing local order parameter. We can rewrite the Hamiltonian (1.3) as follows: H = −J ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ cos (θi − θj)= −J ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ [ e iθie −iθj +h.c.] , (1.4) Then, the information for the spin-spin correlation function is contained in the following correlator ⟨e iθ0e −iθn⟩ = 1 Z ∫ ∏ m dθm e iθ0e −iθn exp ⎧ ⎨ ⎩βJ ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ cos (θi − θj) ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ . (1.5) First we consider the high temperature limit, where a series expansion in β is pos- sible, such that exp ⎧ ⎨ ⎩βJ ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ cos (θi − θj) ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ =1 + βJ ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ cos (θi − θj)+ (βJ)2 2! ⎡ ⎣ ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ cos (θi − θj) ⎤ ⎦ 2 + ··· (1.6) Since ∫ 2π 0 dθ =2π , ∫ 2π 0 dθ e −iθ =0 , (1.7) on calculating the correlation function (1.5), we have to bring one factor that can- cels e iθ0 together with one cancelling e −iθn.But this means that the ﬁrst non-zero contribution to (1.5) will appear at order (βJ)|n|,leading to ⟨e iθ0e −iθn⟩∼ (βJ)|n| =e −|n| ln(kB T/J) , (1.8) that is, an exponential decay of the correlations with a correlation length ξ ∼ 1/ ln(kBT/J). A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 6 For the low temperature limit we expect the diﬀerence θi − θj to be very small, so that we can expand the cosine and keep the lowest order term.In this case we have for i and j nearest neighbors, θi − θj ≃ (∇θi) · aij , (1.9) where aij is the lattice vector in the direction of the bond deﬁned by i and j,such that ⟨e iθ0e −iθn⟩≃ 1 Z ∫ ∏ m dθm e iθ0e −iθn exp { βJ ∑ i a 2 (∇θi)2} = 1 Z ∫ Dθ(x)exp {i [θ (x0) − θ (xn)]} exp {βJ ∫ d 2x (∇θ)2} = 1 Z ∫ Dθ(x)exp { i ∫ d 2x [θ (x) δ (x − x0) − θ (x) δ (x − xn)] } × exp {−βJ ∫ d 2x θ (x) △ θ (x)} , (1.10) where, apart from going to the continuum, we introduced the notation of path integrals, and the Laplacian △,after an integration by parts. The arguments of the last exponential above can be written as follows, ∫ d 2x θ (x) △ θ (x)= ∫ d 2x d 2x ′ θ (x) G−1 (x, x′) θ (x ′) , (1.11) with the inverse propagator G−1 (x − x′)= δ (x − x ′) △ . (1.12) In this way we see that we have an exponential of a bilinear formin θ’s, so that the integral over θ can be performed. The result of such an integration is ⟨e iθ0e −iθn⟩≃ exp [ kBT J G (x0 − xn) ] (1.13) In order to obtain the propagator G (x − x′), it is better to go over to Fourier space and come back: G (x − x′)= ∫ d 2k (2π)2 e −ik·(x−x′) k2 + m2 = 1 2π K0 (m |x − x′|) , (1.14) where we introduced a regulator m,since without it the expression is infrared di- vergent,and K0(z)is a modiﬁed Bessel function, that in the limit m → 0behaves as K0(z) →− ln z. (1.15) A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 7 With this result we have ﬁnally the behavior of the correlation function at low temperatures ⟨e iθ0e −iθn⟩≃ ( 1 |x0 − xn| )kBT/2πJ . (1.16) In the low temperature region, the behavior of the correlation function changes from an exponential decay to a power-law. Nevertheless, it still decays to zero at large distances. This tells us that the order parameter itself is zero, since at large distances, the leading factor is ⟨e iθ0e −iθn⟩∼ ⟨e iθ0⟩⟨e −iθn⟩ + ··· , (1.17) with ··· corresponding to decaying functions of distance. Hence, theBKT-transition shows a diﬀerent kind of phase transition than the the ordinary ones, where an order parameter emerges after spontaneous symmetry breaking While we are not going to discuss the BKT-transition in further detail, it is interesting to recall the physics behind it. Kosterlitz and Thouless showed that there was a conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition at a temperature denoted the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature TKT [5, 6]. Above TKT ,topological objects (vor- tices)are free, disordering the system, and giving rise to a ﬁnite correlation length At low temperatures vortices and antivortices bind together due to a logarithmic interaction (with the same origin as the logarithmic behavior of the propagator, discussed above), such that they do not allow the presence of true long-range order but only of quasi-long range order,with an inﬁnite correlation length.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
