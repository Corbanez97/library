A person drawn at random from a certain population has probability 0.001 of having the disease. 1. Find the probability that a random person tests positive. (This answer will require an accuracy of 4 decimal places.) 0.0509 v 2. Given that the person just tested positive, what is the probability he actually has the disease? 0.0187 v","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
