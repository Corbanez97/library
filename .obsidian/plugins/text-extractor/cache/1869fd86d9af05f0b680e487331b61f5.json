The phase diagram of the 3d gauge Higgs model has been obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation on large (up to 60 3) lattices. We ﬁnd the transition lines continue as 2nd-order until merging into a 1st-order line. These ﬁndings pose the question of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory for a multicritical point involving noncommuting order parameters. A similar phase diagram is predicted for the 2-dimensional quantum toric code model with two external ﬁelds, hz and hx; this problem can be mapped onto an anisotropic 3D gauge Higgs model. PACS numbers: Introduction. Topological quantum phases and anyons are well known in connection with the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect, but they are also expected to exist in frus- trated magnets. It has long been proposed that a certain class of resonating-valence-bond (RVB) [1] phases carries Z2-charges and vortices and has a four-fold degenerate ground state on a torus [2]. A qualitative understand- ing of this phase can be obtained from a so-called toric code model (TCM) [3]. The dimer model on the Kagome lattice is mapped onto the TCM exactly [4] while some other models [5, 6] belong to the same universality class. The TCM is deﬁned in terms of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom located on the bonds of an arbitrary 2d lattice. The Hamiltonian is as follows: HT C = −Jx ∑ s As − Jz ∑ p Bp, (1) where As = ∏ j∈s σx j and Bp = ∏j∈p σz j are products of spin operators (σα j are the Pauli matrixes) on the bonds incident to a lattice site s and on the boundary of a pla- quette p, respectively. The ground state corresponds to eigenvalues As = 1, Bp = 1 for all s and p. On a surface of genus g, it is 4g-fold degenerate. Elementary excita- tions are characterized by eigenvalues As = −1 (a Z2 charge on site s) and Bp = −1 (a Z2 vortex on plaquette p); all excitations are gapped. Each type of quasiparticle is bosonic, but due to nontrivial mutual braiding, they must be jointly regarded as Abelian anyons. The Hamiltonian (1) has special properties related to its exact solvability: the two-point correlator vanishes and the quasiparticles have ﬂat dispersion. These fea- tures do not survive a small generic perturbation, while the topological character of the ground state and the any- onic quasiparticle statistics are robust. Yet a suﬃciently strong ﬁeld can polarize the spins, driving a transition to the topologically trivial phase. Trebst at al [7] stud- ied a perturbation of the form −h ∑ b σz b and solved the problem by reducing it to the 2d transverse-ﬁeld Ising model, which is mapped to an anisotropic 3d classical Ising model. In this paper we consider a more general Hamiltonian: HQ = HT C − hx ∑ b σx b − hz ∑ b σz b , (2) where b runs over the bonds of a square lattice and HT C is given by Eq. (1). Note that the ﬁelds hx and hz induce diﬀerent types of phase transition. The term with hz creates virtual pairs of Z2 charges, which condense when the ﬁeld strength exceeds a certain threshold. This phe- nomenon may be described as a Higgs transition, or as vortex conﬁnement. By duality, the ﬁeld hx causes the condensation of vortices and charge conﬁnement. The competition of the two terms should result in an inter- esting phase diagram, which is the subject of this paper. We approach the problem by reducing the quantum Hamiltonian to a classical anisotropic Z2 gauge Higgs Hamiltonian on a three-dimensional cubic lattice; see Eq. (5) below. We expect the phase diagram to be qual- itatively similar to that for the isotropic case, i.e., model M3,2 as deﬁned by Wegner [8]. Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed for the latter model because it is more amenable to numerics. Some properties of the phase diagram in the isotropic case were predicted by Fradkin and Shenker [9]. In particular, the topological phase is bounded by second-order lines corresponding to charge condensation (for hx ≪ hz ∼ Jx, Jz) and vor- tex condensation (for hz ≪ hx ∼ Jx, Jz), but the two condensate phases are continuously connected. For the quantum Hamiltonian (2), a connecting path is realized by increasing hz so as to polarize the spins in the z di- rection, rotating the ﬁeld in the xz-plane, and decreasing it again. However, the two phase transitions are clearly diﬀerent, therefore the corresponding lines cannot join smoothly. A previous numerical study involving 103 sites by Jongeward, Stack, and Jayaprakash [10] showed the two 2 lines merge into a ﬁrst-order line that partially separates the charge and vortex condensates, and suggested the 2nd-order lines might become 1st-order before merging. As discussed below, our data for larger systems (up to 603 sites) do not conﬁrm this conjecture. Thus, the point where all three lines meet is likely to be a novel type of multicritical point. Note that each of the 2nd- order transitions can be characterized by an Ising-type order parameter, i.e., the amplitude of the corresponding condensate. The two parameters must somehow coexist though they are incompatible at the classical level due to the nontrivial braiding between charges and vortices. (ie., the kinetic terms describing the charge and vortex transport do not commute.) The reduction to a classical problem. The Hamilto- nian (2) is not gauge-invariant, but it can be mapped to a Z2 gauge theory by introducing a dummy spin variable µs (“matter ﬁeld”) at every site, but only considering states |Ψ⟩ such that µ x s |Ψ⟩ = |Ψ⟩. This constraint is a proto- type of the gauge-invariance condition, µ x s As|Ψ⟩ = |Ψ⟩, which says that ﬂipping the spin on a site and all incident bonds does not change the state. To turn one constraint into the other, we apply the transformation: σz uv → µ z uσz uvµ z v, σx uv → σx uv, µ z s → µ z s, µ x s → µ x s As, (3) where σuv belongs to the bond connecting sites u and v. Then, the Hamiltonian becomes: H = −Jx ∑ s µ x s − Jz ∑ p Bp − hx ∑ b σx b −hz ∑ uv µ z uσz uvµ z v. (4) Note that in the ﬁrst term we have replaced As by µs using the gauge-invariance condition, µ x s As ≡ 1. We now map this 2-d quantum Hamiltonian onto a (2+1)-d classical one. The overall scheme is standard [11], but some care should be taken to preserve the gauge invariance. We let ∆τ = β/n, and approximate the quantum partition function Z = Tr[exp(−βH)P] by Tr[exp(−∆τ Hx)P exp(−∆τ Hz)] n, where P is the pro- jector onto the gauge-invariant subspace and Hx, Hz are the terms in the quantum Hamiltonian that depend on σx b , µ x s and σz b , µ z s, respectively. This expression can be written as a classical partition function on a cubic lat- tice. The classical variables σb,t, µs,t = ±1, in each time slice t, correspond to σz b and µ z s respectively. But when we change from 2d to 3d, new vertical bonds (along the time direction) appear. The classical spins on the vertical bonds between two time slices correspond to a choice of term in the expansion of P = ∏ s ( 1 3 To calculate the rest of the phase diagram we per- formed Monte Carlo simulations using standard single- spin ﬂip updates, supplemented by rare (once per N 2 up- dates) ﬂips of all spins belonging to bonds cut by planes oriented along any one of the crystal axes, or along any of the diagonals to these axes. There are 9N possible planes satisfying this condition, and we select any of them at random. The plaquette energy (second term in (9)) is conserved by this update. To determine the 2nd-order critical lines, we employed a standard ﬁnite-size scaling analysis of the speciﬁc heat Cv, for linear system sizes N = 24, 36, 48, and 60 (ie., for 3N 3 spins). First-order critical points were identiﬁed and located using energy distributions. These distributions are bi-modal (have two maxima) for the ﬁrst-order transitions and single-modal otherwise. We thermalized our samples for up to 106 MC sweeps (one sweep having 3N 3 elementary updates). The data were accumulated for ∼ 4 × 108 MC sweeps. The resulting phase diagram is presented in Fig.1. The ﬁrst-order transition coinciding with the self-duality line was observed for 0.2575(5) > λbond > 0.22635(5). Out- side of this interval we saw no bi-modal structure in the energy distribution for system sizes up to N = 60. The inset of Fig.2 shows the evolution of the energy distri- bution function along the self-dual line. Even when the bi-modal structure is observed it is extremely weak, de- veloping only for large N , and the distribution can be sampled in the minimum without ﬂat-histogram or sim- ilar reweighting techniques. 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.74 0.76 0.215 0.220 0.225 0.230 self-duality line λbond λpl λbond λpl (I)(II) (III) (b) (a) (1) (3) (2) FIG. 1: (color online).

Filled squares describe the ﬁrst-order self-dual tran- sitions. Bold and dashed lines are used to guide an eye and correspond to the 1st- and 2nd-order transitions, respectively. The phases are: (I) - topological phase; (II) - topologically dis- ordered phase; (III) - magnetically ordered phase. In inset (a) we show the region where all phases meet each other. In inset (b) we show three alternative ways of connecting the lines. As noted above, these results conﬂict with previous MC simulations in Ref. [10], who suggest the 1st-order line splits into two 1st-order lines. The inset (a) of Fig.1 shows a closeup of the controversial region. Though we were able to resolve critical points with an accuracy of at least three digits, we observed no splitting of the self-dual 1st-order line into two 1st-order transitions. We also ﬁnd no evidence for tri-critical points on the Ising-type lines as long as we can resolve two separate transitions. There remains a tiny parameter range between the apparent disappearance of the bi-modal distribution on the self- dual line (this disappearance probably due to our limited system size) and two resolved 2nd-order transitions.

The distance between two maxima in bi-modal energy distributions along the self-duality line for N = 60 as a function of λbond. The inset shows examples of the energy distributions at various values of λbond. To probe the behavior in this tiny parameter range we need a diﬀerent approach. We therefore scanned energy distributions at 30 points (N = 48) along the line perpen- dicular to the self-duality line right in the questionable re- gion (short solid line in the inset (a)). If the 1st-order line were to split above the scan, the third maximum would have to emerge in the energy distribution right between the two maxima we observe on the self-dual line - imply- ing that the energy maxima on the self-dual line could not merge smoothly, and right below the split, three maxima would have to be seen in the energy distribution. How- ever all distributions along the scan were found to have only one peak. It is also clear from the main part of Fig.2 that on the self-duality line, the energy maxima approach each other and merge continuously as λbond in- creases. The curves presented in Fig.2 follow a power law near the vanishing point, with corresponding critical exponent ∼ 0.55. We thus conclude that the split 1st-order scenario does not work. Instead there are three possibilities. Either all three lines merge at one point (case (1) in the in- set (b), Fig.1); or the 1st-order line ends before or after the point where two 2nd-order lines touch the self-dual 4 line (cases (2) and (3) in the inset (b), Fig.1). Unfor- tunately our data cannot distinguish between the alter- natives because the 2nd-order lines seem to touch at ex- tremely small (possibly zero) angle. Formally, option (2) ﬁts the data best. Theoretically, the last two scenarios are less demanding since they ﬁt the existing theory of phase transitions (our data suggest that the 2nd-order transitions cannot merge into a single smooth curve and form a kink at the self-dual line). We are not aware of any eﬀective theory leading to the ﬁrst scenario. Phases. Using the two correspondence equations ˜hz = − 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
