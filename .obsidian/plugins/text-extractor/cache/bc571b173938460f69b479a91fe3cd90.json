DOOBf The theory of probability has made much progress recently in the direc- tion of completely mathematical formulations of its methods and results. J The purpose of this paper is to make a further contribution in this direction. In order to analyze the results of repeated trials of an experiment, a certain space of infinitely many dimensions is the proper tool. This space is discussed in the first section of the paper. In the second section, the results of the first are applied to obtain for the first time a complete proof of the validity of the method of maximum likelihood of R. A. Fisher, which is used in statistics to estimate the true probability distribution when the results of a repeated experiment are known. 1. The space fi(P) It will be seen that the space fl(P) described below provides the natural basis for the analysis of experiments with repeated trials. The preliminary facts, which are not new, will be stated in the form of 3 theorem. Theorem 1.

A field is a <r-field if whenever A\\, A2, • ■ • is a sequence of sets in the field, X i-iAj is also in the field. It will then follow thatIJ\"_i^i is in the field. A set function p(A) defined on the sets of a <r-field is completely additive if when A\\, A¡, • • • is a sequence of disjunct sets in the field, p (2~L°°>-iAi)=El-i p(.Aj). |[ The sets in the field of definition of pp will be called measurable with respect to F(x). If A is measurable with respect to F(x), pp(A) is the variation of F(x) over A. The definitions of functions measurable with respect to F{x) and of their integration are formulated in the usual way, giving the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. 759 760 J. L. DOOB [October Let fl(P) be the space whose points are the sequences ( • • • , x-¡, x0, Xx, • • ■ ), where x¡ is any real number. There is a a-field of point sets of Q(F), including all sets determined by conditions of the form (2) x,*Ej (j = 0, ± 1, • • • ), where the point sets Ex, E2, • ■ ■ are measurable with respect to F(x) and a com- pletely additive non-negative set function Pf(A) defined on this field, such that if A. is of the type (2), (3) PfÍA)=UPfÍEj). The sets in the field of definition of Pf will be called measurable with re- spect to Fix); the measurability (with respect to Fix)) and integration of functions defined on íí(P) are then defined in the usual way. This space was first discussed by Daniell.* It should be noted that if c6(co) is a measurable function on 0(F), and if c6(co) dépends only on Xx\\ c6(co) =fixi), fix) is measurable with respect to Fix), and (4) f <Kco)dco= f°fix)dFix) J a(F) J -oo where the existence of either integral implies that of the other. This space Q(F) is introduced as a tool in the rigorous analysis of certain ideas in the theory of probability. Let F(x) determine a probability distribu- tion, i.e. we suppose that there is a chance variable * such that the probability that x<x is F(x). Then (1) is satisfied. If a single trial is made, pr(A) is the probability that the value of x obtained will be in the set A. If a finite suc- cession of trials is made, obtaining values &»••\"> £», and if A is a point set of ß(P) on which Pp is defined, P/?(A) is the probability that there is a point co: ( ■ • • ,Xo, • • ■ ) in A such that #, = £„/ = l, •••,». The usual interpreta- tion if A is a set of the form (2) is obvious. The advantage of this point of viewf is that the set-up is independent of the number of trials.

Daniell actually only considered the space whose points are sequences of the form (xi, x2, ■ ■ ■ ), but the treatment of Q(F) could be carried through in the same way. These considerations concerning the space Q(F) can be considered as a particular case of a general treatment given by Kolmogoroff, loc. cit., pp. 24-30. t A similar point of view was taken by A. Khintchine, Zeitschrift für angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik, vol. 13 (1933), pp. 101-103, who treated the case of a chance variable which only takes on the values 1 or 0 (making less restrictions on PfW however). This space was used for the same purpose by E. Hopf, Journal of Mathematics and Physics of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, vol. 13 (1934), pp. 51-102. The place of these methods in the theory of stochastic proc- esses was discussed by the writer in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 20 (1934), pp. 376-379. 1934] PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS 761 bles become measurable functions on fi(P), and their integrals on ß(P) are their expectations. The law of large numbers will be seen to correspond to the ergodic theorem of Birkhoff.* The convergence of a sequence of chance varia- bles in probabilityf is simply convergence in measure on Q(P)4 Theorem 2. The transformation T of Q(P) into itself, T: xj = xi+i (/ = 0, + 1, ■ • ■ ), is a one-to-one measure-preserving transformation. If A is a measurable set in- variant under T, Pf(A) =0, or Pp(A) = 1.§ If faoi) is any measurable function on ß(P) such that f0(F) \\faco) \\2du exists and such that faTos) = eixe/>(co) for some real number X, faw) = I faw)d(a J 0(F) almost everywhere on ß(P). The second part of the theorem includes the first part if X=0, and if fact) is considered as the characteristic function of a point set, so only the second part of the theorem need be considered. The proof will be given in several steps. (i) Let Fix) be 0 for a;<0, xíor 0¿x¿l and 1 for x>l, and let pFiA) and Pf(A) for this Fix) be denoted by PoiA), Po(A), respectively. Let fi0 be the subset of ß(P) consisting of the points ( • • •, x~i, x<¡, Xi, ■ ■ ■ ) whose co- ordinates satisfy the inequalities 0^ Xj ¿ 1, j = 0, ±1, • • • . It will be shown that the general set functions PfÍA) and Pf(A) can be derived from poiA) andP0(A). In fact, let y=Fix) transform the points of the x-axis into points of the interval 0¿y¿ 1, where if Fix) has a jump at x0, the point Xo will be made to correspond to the interval P(a;0) ¿y¿Fix+0). Then ppiA) is de- fined for those and only those sets whose images on the y-axis are Lebesgue measurable, and for such sets PfÍA) is defined as the Lebesgue measure of the image of A. In the same way the set A^ on fl(P) measurable with respect to Fix) goes over into a set Av on ö0 on which Po(A) is defined, and Pp(Ax) * Cf. A. Khintchine, loc. cit., and E.

The method of maximum likelihood For each value of p in some point set E let f(x, p) be a probability density over the interval — oo <x<<x>.] Assume that the chance variable * has a probability distribution whose density is f(x, p) for some (unknown) value of p in E. Then an important problem in statistics is that of estimating the true value of p by means of large samples of values of x, obtained inde- pendently. This is done by the method of maximum likelihood of R. A. Fisher%, which has supplanted the use of Bayes' theorem. If x\\, ■ ■ ■ , xn is a sample of values of x, and if f(x, p) is the probability density of the distribu- tion of values of x, the probability of obtaining a sample of values xí, ■ • •, xi where */ is in a small interval with midpoint x¡, is, in the limit, proportional to II\"-i/(* j, p) ■ The method of maximum likelihood takes as an approximation to po, the true value of p, the value pn of p (or one of them if there are sev- eral) which makes this product a maximum. If pn approaches po in probabil- ity as the samples become larger, pn is called a consistent estimate of p. A * The theorem will be needed as here stated. It can be stated in terms of Riemann-Stieltjes integration, making unnecessary any restrictions on F{x). t This means that/(«, />)ä0, that/(x, p) is defined for almost all values of x, is measurable and integrable over the *-axis, and that f_J(x)dx= 1. It is supposed that there is a chance variable x(p) whose values are distributed in such a way that the probability of x{p) being in any measurable point set A isfAf(x)dx.

The method of maximum likelihood, when analyzed more carefully, yields further information.
