Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 8 2 The Ising model, duality, and transfer matrix In this section we still concentrate on the Ising model without gauge ﬁelds. The subjects we discuss in this chapter are, on the one hand, needed afterwards in our treatment of lattice gauge theories. In particular, the concept of duality proved on the other hand to be useful in several context in theoretical physics ranging from statistical mechanics of classical systems to string theories. Therefore, it is useful to discuss them in some detail. 2.1 Self-duality in the two-dimensional Ising model Here we will just consider duality in the two-dimensional Ising model, as was ﬁrst introduced by Kramers and Wannier [7]. A comprehensive exposition on duality can be found in the review article by Savit [8]. We start by considering the partition function of the Ising model deﬁned in (1.1), that can be rewritten as follows: Z = ∑ {Sj} e K P ⟨j,ℓ⟩ SjSℓ = ∑ {Sj } ∏ ⟨j,ℓ⟩ e KSjSℓ = ∑ {Sj} ∏ ⟨j,ℓ⟩ 1∑ r=0 Cr(K) (SjSℓ)r , (2.1) where C0(K) = cosh K and C1(K) = sinh K. With the simple transformations above, we see that for each bond ⟨j, ℓ⟩, a new Z2 variable can be introduced, namely r. To recall this fact, we label it as rµ with µ ≡ (i, ⟨i, j⟩), that is, we label it with the site i from which the bond ⟨i, j⟩ emanates. The partition function can now be expressed as follows Z = ∑ {Sj } ∑ {rµ} ∏ ⟨j,ℓ⟩ Crµ(K) ∏ i S P ⟨i,j⟩ rµ i , (2.2) where we grouped together all the products of spins on site i, such that ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ rµ contains all four contributions due to the bonds connected to site i. We can further perform explicitely the sum over spin conﬁgurations, leading to (2.2) = ∑ {rµ} ∏ ⟨j,ℓ⟩ Crµ(K) ∏ i ∑ Si=±1 S P ⟨i,j⟩ rµ i = ∑ {rµ} ∏ ⟨j,ℓ⟩ Crµ(K) ∏ i 2δ  mod2   ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ rµ     , (2.3) where the Kroneker delta gives 1 if the sum over bonds is even and zero if it is odd. Now we have achieved an expression for the partition function expressed only in terms of the new Z2 variable rµ. The presence of the Kroneker δ in (2.3) shows that many conﬁgurations have vanishing contributions. It would be more eﬀective if we could ﬁnd variables that automatically satisfy it. This can be achieved by deﬁning a dual lattice, where the A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 9 vertices are set in the center of the plaquettes deﬁned by the original one. Figure 1 shows the dual lattice corresponding to the original square lattice. i j r σi µ Figure 1: Dual lattice. Black full lines correspond to the original lattice, where rµ denotes a bond. Blue dashed lines correspond to the dual lattice. The link joining the sites i and j on the dual lattice crosses the bond rµ. New variables σi are deﬁned on the sites of the dual lattice. We deﬁne now new Z2 variables σi = ±1 on the sites of the dual lattice. For each link of the original lattice there is a pair of σi’s (e.g. on the sites i and j on the dual lattice in Fig. 1) that we can associate to it. We can express the variable rµ in terms of the new variables as follows: rµ = 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 10 rµ over the bonds. To see this, we consider those four cases below. 1 4 2 3 i Figure 2: Four sites on the dual lattice with links crossing bonds around i. i) σi = 1 ∀ i. An equivalent conﬁguration is with all σi’s inverted. Here we have ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ rµ = 0 . (2.6) ii) σ1 = σ2 = σ3 = −σ4 = 1. There are in total 8 equivalent conﬁgurations of this type and the result for the sum is ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ rµ = 2 . (2.7) iii) σ1 = σ3 = −σ2 = −σ4 = 1. An equivalent conﬁguration is obtained with all σi’s inverted. ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ rµ = 4 . (2.8) iv) σ1 = σ4 = −σ2 = −σ3 = 1. Here we have in total 4 equivalent conﬁgurations, each one leading to ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ rµ = 2 . (2.9) The listing above shows that with the choice of variables we made, we allways satisfy the δ-function. Then, for the partition function we have. Z = 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 11 where the factor 1/2 is due to the fact that for each value of rµ, there are two conﬁgurations of the σ’s, the factor 2N comes from the factor 2 in front of the Kroneker δ in (2.3) with N the number of sites on the lattice, and the product is now over bonds in the dual lattice. The expression of the partition function (2.10) shows that the weight for each conﬁguration of the σ’s is given by the coeﬃcients C(K). Therefore, the next step is to see whether it is possible to bring C(K) to a form that looks like a Boltzmann weight. In order to maintain a short notation, we keep here the label rµ. Cr(K) = cosh K [1 + r (tanh K − 1)] = cosh K exp {ln [1 + r (tanh K − 1)]} = cosh K exp (r ln tanh K) = cosh K exp [ 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 12 is self-dual since the duality transformation brings it into itself. Since tanh K < 1, ˜K > 0. Furthermore, when K → ∞, ˜K → 0. The opposite happens when K → 0. Therefore, the duality transformation relates the hight T region (low T region) of the original model to the low T (high T ) region of the dual one. This is a common feature of duality transformations, relating opposite regions of the dual models or of the same model, when it is self-dual. Such a relation is very useful, since it is in general possible to perform a high temperature expansion. The duality transformation tells then how the behavior is in the low temperature region, that is in general more diﬃcult to extract. Due to its self-duality, it is possible to extract for the two-dimensional Ising model the value of the critical temperature. To see this, we consider the free energy per site f = − 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 13 Assuming again, that given Kx and Ky there is only one critical point, we can sum- marize both equations above into the following condition for a critical line separating the ordered from the disordered phase in an anisotropic Ising model: sinh(2Kxc) sinh(2Kyc) = 1 . (2.19) The same condition is obtained in the exact solution of the anisotropic case [9], using in part the transfer matrix method, to be discussed in the next section. Figure 4 shows the phase diagram of the anisotropic Ising model. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Kxc 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Kyc Paramagnetic Ferromagnetic Figure 4: Phases of the anisotropic Ising model with the critical line obtained from the duality relations. For a further more general account of duality relations, see the review article by Savit, Ref. [8]. 2.2 Transfer matrix: from two dimensional classical statistics to one dimensional quantum mechanics The transfer matrix played an important role in deriving a more transparent exact solution of the two dimensional Ising model [9] than the one originally obtained by Onsager [10], and is a well established method in statistical mechanics. Besides this, it will play an important role in models for lattice gauge theory. We start with the partition function Z = ∑ {Si} e −S , (2.20) with S = −K ∑ ⟨i,j⟩ SiSj , (2.21) A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 14 and Si = ±1. Since we are dealing with the model in two dimensions, it is better to introduce coordinates (p, q) for each site, where p, q ∈ Z, and denote the coordinates in x- and y-direction, respectively. We generalize our model allowing for diﬀerent couplings along the x- and y-directions, and having N sites in the x-direction and M-sites in the y-direction but keeping periodic boundary conditions (p.b.c) along both directions. With all these changes, the action S can be written as follows: S = M∑ q=1 L(q, q + 1) , (2.22) where due to p.b.c. M + 1 → 1. The ”Lagrangean” L(q, q + 1) is given by L(q, q + 1) = N∑ p=1 (−KxSp,qSp+1,q − KySp,qSp,q+1) , (2.23) where again, due to p.b.c. N + 1 → 1. We consider ﬁrst the case Kx = 0, that corresponds to N decoupled one- dimensional Ising models. Let us consider one of those chains, say the p-th one and at a given site q. Then, the partition function consists of a product of terms as follows, Zp = ∑ Sp,1,...,Sp,M ∏ q T y pq , with T y pq = e KySp,qSp,q+1 . (2.24) Since the variables Sp,q have two possible values, we can represent them by a two component vector (a spinor): Sp,q = +1 → ( 1 0 ) , Sp,q = −1 → ( 0 1 ) , (2.25) such that T y pq can be viewed as a 2 × 2 matrix: T y Sp,q,Sp,q+1 = ( e Ky e −Ky e −Ky e Ky ) . (2.26) Since a 2 × 2 matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices, we have T y pq = e Ky1 + e −Kyσx pq = e Ky (1 + e −2Ky σx pq) . (2.27) At this point we recall that T y pq is part of a partition function, and therefore, it would be easier to interpret what we have, if we could express it as the exponential of an operator. Using the fact that (σx)2 = 1, we have in general exp ( ˜Ky σx) = cosh ˜Ky + sinh ˜Ky σx = cosh ˜Ky ( 1 + tanh ˜Ky σx) . (2.28) Hence, setting tanh ˜Ky = e −2Ky , (2.29) A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 15 we ﬁnally have T y pq = ( sinh ˜Ky cosh ˜Ky)−1/2 exp ( ˜Ky σx pq) . (2.30) This form is reminiscent of the one obtained in eq. (2.11) when we discussed duality. In fact, inverting (2.29), we have e −2 ˜Ky = tanh Ky ⇒ ˜Ky = −1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 16 where h = B/kBT , and B is the applied magnetic ﬁeld. We can generalize T y pq to this case as follows: T y pq → e KySp,qSp,q+1+h(Sp,q+Sp,q+1)/2 , (2.38) such that the matrix is now T y Sp,q,Sp,q+1 → ( e Ky+h e −Ky e −Ky e Ky−h ) . (2.39) From here one can obtain the eigenvalues and hence, the free energy as a function of temperature and magnetic ﬁeld. The derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld gives the magnetization, and the result is that it vanishes for B = 0 at any temperature T > 0. The explicit calculation can be found in the book on statistical mechanics by K. Huang. For the two-dimensional case, we have still to switch on Kx. Since we have already seen that an operator σx entered, it is also convenient to introduce a notation with bras and kets where | Sp,q = ±1⟩ are eigenstates of σz. Then, the matrix elements of T y can be expressed as ⟨Sp,q | T y pq | Sp,q+1⟩. Now we can consider two columns p and p + 1, where we introduce an operator T x with matrix elements ⟨Sp,qSp+1,q | T x pq | Sp,q+1Sp+1,q+1⟩ = e KxSp,qSp+1,q . (2.40) Here we see that the operator T x should be such that its matrix elements contain no information on the states at q + 1. Furthermore, its action on the states at p and p + 1 is T x pq | Sp,q = 1, Sp+1,q = 1⟩ = T x pq | Sp,q = −1, Sp+1,q = −1⟩ = e Kx , T x pq | Sp,q = 1, Sp+1,q = −1⟩ = T x pq | Sp,q = −1, Sp+1,q = 1⟩ = e −Kx . (2.41) All the requirements above are met by T x pq = exp (Kxσz p,qσz p+1,q) . (2.42) With the result above and (2.33) we arrive at the partition function for the whole system: Z = (2 sinh 2Ky)N M/2 TrT M , (2.43) with T = exp ( Kx ∑ p σz pσz p + 1 ) exp ( ˜Ky ∑ p σx p ) . (2.44) This is now the transfer matrix for the two-dimensional anisotropic Ising model. In contrast to the one-dimensional case, we have now instead of a 2×2 matrix, a 2N ×2N A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 17 dimensional array. It is however possible to solve the problem exactly, by means of a Jordan-Wigner transformation making fermions out of spins [9]. We are not going to pursue this path but would like to explicitely show that the transfer matrix can be seen as an evolution operator in quantum mechanics, i.e. that it has the form of an exponential of a Hamiltonian. Here we follow the discussion introduced by Fradkin and Susskind [11]. We ﬁrst notice that the two exponentials entering (2.44) do not commute with each other. This makes in fact the problem really quantum mechanical. However, if by some reason the arguments of both exponentials were multiplied by a small constant ∆τ , we could expand each exponential to ﬁrst order in that constant and reexponentiate the result afterwards, such that the transfer matrix could be written as the exponential of an object that would correspond to a Hamiltonian. The error made acting like that would be of O (∆τ 2), such that in the limit ∆τ → 0, it vanishes. Going back to (2.44) this means that we have to look for the situation where both Kx and ˜Ky are small. From eq. (2.29) we see that this means Kx ∝ ∆τ , e −2Ky ∝ ∆τ . (2.45) That is, we are interested in the region Ky ≫ 1 and Kx ≪ 1. Although it seems to be a very special portion of parameter space, the phase diagram in Fig. 4 shows that it is still interesting, since there will be a phase transition between a disordered and an ordered phase. For deﬁnitness, we take ˜Ky = ∆τ , Kx = λ∆τ , (2.46) where λ is a proportionally constant which, in principle, can take any value as long as the condition ∆τ ≪ 1 is fulﬁlled. Performing these replacements in (2.44), we can write Z ∝ Tr e −βQM H , (2.47) where we deﬁned βQM = M∆τ , the temperature in the quantum mechanical system, and H = − ∑ p σx p − λ ∑ p σz pσz p+1 , (2.48) the one-dimensional Hamiltonian of the Ising model with transverse ﬁeld, that due to the presence of two noncommuting pieces is a genuinely quantum mechanical model. The thermodynamic limit of the two-dimensional classical model corresponds to the limit M, N → ∞, so that the quantum mechanical counterpart will show a phase transition only in the limit βQM → 0, i.e. only in its ground-state. This is an example of a quantum phase transition, where the parameter driving the phase transition is not any more the temperature but a coupling of the Hamiltonian, in this case λ. In order to obtain the critical value of λ, we recall the relation (2.19). In the limit of interest here (Ky ≫ 1 and Kx ≪ 1), that relation reduces to 2Kxc 1 A. Muramatsu - Lattice gauge theory - Summer 2009 18 On the other hand, in the same limit, we have from (2.29) ˜Ky = e −2Ky , (2.50) such that Kx = λe −2Ky , (2.51) that together with (2.49) leads to λc = 1. Increasing λ brings us into the ordered phase, while decreasing it leads to the disordered phase, as depicted in Fig. 4. Therefore, large values of λ correspond to the low temperature phase and small values to the high temperature one. Hence, we can identify 1/λ with temperature. We have seen that in order to map the classical system into a quantum mechanical one, we had to search for the continuum limit in imaginary time. Yet, the critical properties of the original model could be recovered by an appropriate scaling of couplings in the spatial and temporal directions. Such a relation between quantum and classical counterparts will prove usefull in understanding the phases of lattice gauge models.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
