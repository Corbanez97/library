Exercise: Random variables [ Bookmark this page Exercise: Random variables 0 points possible (ungraded) Background: a number, e.g. 2, can be thought of as a trivial random variable that always takes the value 2. Let @ be a number. Let X be a random variable associated with some probabilistic experiment. a) Is it always true that X + z is a random variable? X Answer: Yes b) Is it always true that X — z = 0? X Anser: No Solution: a) Yes. Think of a concrete example. Let X be the height of a randomly selected student and let z = 10. We are dealing with the random variable X + 10. It is the random variable that takes the value a + 10, whenever the random variable X takes the value a. b) No. Think of the same concrete example as before. The object X — 10, where X is the height of a randomly selected student, has no reason to be equal to 0. (We often use 2 to denote the realized value of X. But the problem statement never said that the number & considered here had any relation to the realized value of X.)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
