Exercise: Exponential CDF [ Bookmark this page Exercises due Mar 15, 2024 08:59 -03 ~ Completo Exercise: Exponential CDF 1/2 points (graded) Let X be an exponential random variable with parameter 2. Find the CDF of X Express your answer in terms of z using standard notation. Use 'e' for the base of the natural logarithm (e.g., enter e~(-3*x) for e 37, a)Forz <0, Fx (z) = ) - x (2) + Answer: 0 0 D)Forz >0, Fx (2) = gagny Answer: 1-e\"(-2*x) _e2e Solution: a) Since X is a nonnegative random variable, Fy (z) = P (X < z) = 0 forz < 0. b) We have seen that for an exponential random variable with parameter A and for any a > 0, we have P (X >a)=e . Therefore, Fy (z) =P (X <z)=1-P(X>z)=1—-e M =1—e 2.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
