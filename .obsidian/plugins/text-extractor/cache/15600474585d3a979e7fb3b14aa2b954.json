Which one of the following statements is correct? Hint: You can take for granted the intuitive fact that B [X | X = z] = z. OE[X+Y|X]=0. OEX+Y|X] ==z @E[X+Y|X]=X. OEX+Y|X]=X+Y. Solution: Using linearity of expectations, and then the independence assumption, we have E[X+Y|X=2¢|=E[X|X=2¢]+E[Y|X=c]=c+E[Y] =z Translating this statement into abstract notation, we obtain E [X + Y| X] = X.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
