Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been intensively investigated due to its great homogeneity and high luminosity, which make it possible to use them as standardizable candles for the determination of cosmological parameters. In 2011, the physics Nobel prize was awarded “for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae.” This a pedagogical article, aimed at those starting their study of that subject, in which we dwell on some topics related to the analysis of SNe Ia and their use in luminosity distance estimators. Here we investigate their spectral properties and light curve standardization, paying careful attention to the fundamental quantities directly related to the SNe Ia observables. Finally, we describe our own step-by-step implementation of a classical light curve ﬁtter, the stretch, applying it to real data from the Carnegie Supernova Project.

Introduction A supernova (SN or SNe, from the plural supernovae) is a stellar explosion which may occur at the ﬁnal stage of the evolution of a star or as the result of the interaction between stars in a binary system. The current supernova classiﬁcation follows the historical order in which these events were observed. Initially, the explosions were divided into types I and II, according to the presence (type II) or absence (type I) of hydrogen emission lines in their spectra. Later, the observation of SNe with diﬀerent spectral features resulted in the introduction of the subtypes which we use nowadays (see ﬁgure 1). SNe of types II, Ib and Ic are now believed to occur due to gravitational collapse of massive stars (above ∼ 8 solar masses), which leave behind a neutron star or a black hole. Type Ia SNe, on the other hand, are believed to be thermonuclear explosions in which the star is completely incinerated. It is currently accepted that SN Ia are thermonuclear explosions [1] of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs that reach explosion conditions when, by accreting massarXiv:1411.3596v1 [astro-ph.CO] 13 Nov 2014 2 from a companion, approach the Chandrasekhar limiting mass (∼ 1.4 solar masses)‡.[3] In the single degenerate scenario, the companion is generally considered to be a main sequence, a red giant or an AGB star, whereas in the double degenerate scenario it is another white dwarf. The nitty-grity details of the explosion process and the progenitor channel are still open to debate, both theoretically and observationally.[4, 5, 6] Figure 1. Schematic classiﬁcation of supernovae. As already stated, SNe are classiﬁed according to the presence or absence of certain spectral lines in their spectra and, for SNe II subtypes, the shape of their light curves. Type I SNe can be divided into three subtypes: SNe Ia present a silicon absorption feature around wavelength λ = 6150 ˚A (their main characteristic); SNe Ib does not present silicon lines but present helium absorption lines; and SNe Ic present neither silicon nor helium features. To learn more about the spectral features of SNe, see [7]. The most interesting subtype for cosmological purposes is the Ia, because of their high power, which allows us to detect them in distant galaxies, and their quite homogeneous emission, which makes possible their use as standard candles. A given class of astrophysical objects (or events) is considered a standard candle when their intrinsic luminosity is known or can somehow be estimated. In the case of SNe Ia, the observation of nearby events showed that all explosions had quite similar luminosities and the relatively small variations (as compared to the typical magnitudes of SNe Ia) can be corrected for (in fact, due to the existence of such ﬂuctuations these events should actually be considered standardizable candles). SNe Ia themselves can be divided into subgroups and a classiﬁcation scheme much used in the literature is the ‡ The exact value of this limiting mass depends on several properties of the white dwarf: metallicity, Coulomb corrections, temperature, rotation, magnetic ﬁelds, etc; in any event, realistically, these corrections seem to amount to no more than 10%.[2] 3 one by Branch et al.,[8] according to which these events can be 1991bg-like§, which are subluminous, 1991T-like, which are superluminous, and normal (Branch-normal ). To have concrete numbers to express those variations, we calculated the sample standard deviation in absolute magnitudes MB (cf. section 2) of the SNe Ia in a sample of Vaughan et al.,[9] comprising 50 SNe Ia, of which 25 are Branch-normal. Considering only the Branch-normal SNe Ia, the standard deviation of the distribution of MB is 0.65 mag, while its mean is −18.5 mag. For a more recent data sample, see [10] Since the ﬂux of a source measured on Earth is proportional to the source’s luminosity and inversely proportional to its distance squared (more precisely, to its luminosity distance squared, which we will deﬁne later), we see that it is possible to estimate the SNe Ia distance by measuring its ﬂux. It was using SNe Ia that the winners of the 2011 physics Nobel prize discovered in 1998 and 1999 that the universe is currently on an accelerated expansion.[11, 12] Currently, we believe that the cosmic acceleration is caused, in the context of general relativity, by an unknown form of energy, called dark energy, which would generate a gravitational repulsion unlike radiation, baryonic and cold dark matter, for which the gravitational interaction is attractive. The most popular candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, which is usually interpreted as vacuum energy. There are, nevertheless, other explanations for the accelerated expansion being investigated, based either on modiﬁcations of general relativity, or on the existence of inhomogeneities in the matter distribution of the Universe.[13] As already mentioned, SNe Ia are standardizable candles which can be observed in very distant galaxies due to their high power. They are, however, rare events ∥ and, since being explosions, they are transients (lasting around three months), which makes their observation a diﬃcult task. In order to detect a high number of SNe, various projects are being planned, as this will demand a greater number of researchers in the ﬁeld. For a list of these projects and some of the most important past and present experiments, see Table 1. Our goal in this work is to highlight some basic concepts concerning the use of SNe Ia for cosmology, which we found are not detailed in textbooks. We believe that this work will be of great utility for those who are starting their research in the ﬁeld, as well as for researchers who have never worked speciﬁcally in this ﬁeld. In section 2 we present the basic concepts of spectrum, light curve, ﬂux, magnitudes, all of them derivable from the fundamental concept of speciﬁc ﬂux. In section 3, we discuss the inﬂuences distance and redshift have on the speciﬁc ﬂux of an arbitrary source. In section 4 we discuss our naive light curve standardization, by taking advantage of a sort of stretch correction that characterizes only the variations in SNe Ia rise-and- decline rates, but not the intrinsic luminosity diﬀerences. In section 5 we present our § Supernovae are named for their year of occurrance and an uppercase letter, e.g., “SN 1987A”. If the alphabet is exhausted, double lower case naming is used: [Year] aa .. az, ba .. bz, etc; e.g., “SN 1997bs”. ∥ For supernovae relatively close to our galaxy with 0 < z < 0.3, the rate of occurrence of SNe Ia per volume is (3.43 ± 0, 15) × 10 −5 supernovae/year/Mpc3, according to [14]. 4 Table 1.

In Appendix A we describe some usual transformations of an arbitrary function, for generic pedagogical reasons. 2. Fundamental quantities The speciﬁc ﬂux ¶ (in the wavelength representation) measured by a detector is generically deﬁned as the inﬁnitesimal energy received by the detector per inﬁnitesimal time interval, per inﬁnitesimal perpendicular area, per inﬁnitesimal wavelength interval,+ i.e., fλ := dE dt dA⊥ dλ . (1) The speciﬁc ﬂux for a given source will in general depend not only on the wavelength λ, on the distance to the source r (cf. subsection 3.1) and on the source’s speciﬁc power or luminosity Lλ, but also, for transient sources, on the time t, and for moving sources, on the redshift z (cf. subsection 3.2); concretely fλ = fλ(λ, t, r, z, Lλ). For simplicity, in future references to this equation we may suppress one or more dependences in the function fλ. More on the discussion present in this section can be found in classical astrophysics books such as [22]. There are basically two techniques used for detecting astronomical objects: spectroscopy and photometry. In spectroscopy one uses a spectrograph to decompose the incoming light into its diﬀerent wavelength components and obtain a measure of the speciﬁc ﬂux at a given time, i.e. the spectrum of the object. Despite the high ¶ The expression speciﬁc refers to quantities measured per unit wavelength (or frequency), while bolometric refers to quantities integrated over all wavelengths (or frequencies). + The typical unit of fλ is 1 erg/cm 2/s/˚A, whereas for the corresponding frequency representation, fν(t, ν) = cfλ(t, c/ν)/ν2, it is 1 erg/cm2/s/Hz = 10 23 Jy (jansky). 5 spectral resolving power in wavelength (R := λ/∆λ, where ∆λ is the resolution of the spectrograph) provided by spectroscopy (a low to intermediate resolution spectrograph has R of the order 1000–10000, whereas state of the art high resolution ones can achieve R ≃ 100000), it demands more observation time per object and more expensive equipment. In ﬁgure 2, we show some spectra from typical SNe Ia. à à à à à à à à æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Λ HÅLfΛ+constantH10-16erg’cm2’s’ÅL à SN2007px, z = 0.108 H fΛ + 3.8L æ SN2006fy, z = 0.083 H fΛ + 1.9L ô SN2006py, z = 0.058 H fΛ L Figure 2. Observed spectra of some SNe Ia, at four days before B band maximum light.[23] Here and in all forthcoming ﬁgures showing spectra, geometric symbols (circles, squares, and triangles) serve only as a guide for the reader to better identify to which SN each curve refers. In photometry one uses ﬁlters, which let the light pass only for a particular wavelength interval (the ﬁlter bandpass), and the resulting observation, called ﬂux, corresponds to speciﬁc ﬂux integrated over this interval. Flux measures in a given ﬁlter at diﬀerent times (or epochs) constitute a usual (not speciﬁc) light curve of the object. Photometry is a cheaper and faster technique and there are many projects being designed to get a huge amount of data through photometric observations. We now show how to obtain SN Ia light curve templates at a given ﬁlter from a theoretical model for fλ(λ, t). These templates are necessary for the standardization of SN Ia light curves, as will be discussed in section 4. First we have to take into account the bandpass of the chosen ﬁlter. The ﬁlters UBVRI (also known as the Johnson-Cousins ﬁlter set) are traditionally used to characterize SNe in the rest frame and will be used in this work. The reader can ﬁnd a detailed discussion on photometric systems in Bessell.[24] We show in ﬁgure 3 the transmissivity curves, i.e. the fraction of energy that passes through the ﬁlter as a function of wavelength, SX λ , for these ﬁlters. It is important to notice that the ﬁlters are not perfect, in the sense that they do not let all photons pass, no matter what wavelength we consider. We will deﬁne the ﬂux in band X, f X, as the energy ﬂux that 6 is transmitted through ﬁlter X, which can be written as f X(t) := ∫ ∞ 0 fλ(λ, t)SX λ (λ)dλ, (2) where we have, for brevity of notation, suppressed the dependence of fλ (and thereby of f X) on r. 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 λ ( ˚A) 0 20 40 60 80 100SXλ(%)U B V R I Figure 3. Transmissivity curves for the UBVRI ﬁlters typically used in photometry. The light curves are generally given in terms of the apparent magnitude in a given ﬁlter X, which is related to the ﬂux f X by∗ mX(t) := −2.5 log ( f X(t) gX ) , (3) where gX is the reference ﬂux, that can be for instance the ﬂux of a given star to which all other sources will be compared and deﬁnes a magnitude system. A photometric system is deﬁned by a set of ﬁlters (in our case UBVRI ) and the reference ﬂux deﬁned in all of them. In principle, the reference ﬂux can be diﬀerent for each ﬁlter, however this is not mandatory. In this work we use the AB magnitude system,[25, 26] which uses as reference a constant speciﬁc ﬂux for all frequencies: gAB ν = 3631 Jy . Another commonly used magnitude system is the one that uses as reference ﬂux the ﬂux of the Vega star in the chosen ﬁlters. Our photometric system will be deﬁned by the ﬁlter set UBVRI and the AB magnitudes. In order to mantain the notation most commonly used by astronomers, throughout the text we are going to refer to the apparent magnitude in a given ﬁlter X by simply the letter X so, for example, the apparent magnitude of an object measured with the B ﬁlter will be just denoted B. ∗ Throughout the text log denotes decimal (base 10) logarithm. 7 The ﬁlter reference ﬂux gX is given by gX := ∫ ∞ 0 gX λ (λ)SX λ (λ)dλ, (4) where gX λ (λ) is the specﬁc reference ﬂux for ﬁlter X. Since we chose to perform our calculations in wavelength space, we need to rewrite the AB reference speciﬁc ﬂux using the relation gν(ν)dν = gλ(λ)dλ. Recalling that c = λν, we can obtain the reference speciﬁc ﬂux as a function of wavelength gX λ (λ) = cgAB ν λ2 . Therefore, to build a light curve, we need to evaluate the magnitudes for a given ﬁlter using (3) for spectra at diﬀerent epochs. In ﬁgure 4, we show some light curves from typical SNe Ia, whereas in ﬁgure 5 we show a SN Ia light curve obtained from the SN Ia template generated by Nugent.[28] à à àààààà àààààààààààààà à àà à àà àààà à à à ààà àààààààà ààà à à à ààà æ æ æ æ æææææææææææææ æ æ æ æ ææ æ æ æ æ æ ææææ ææ ææ æ æ æ æ æ ôôô ôôôôôô ô ôôô ô ôô ô ô ô ôô ô ôô ô ô ôô ô ô ô ô ô 0 20 40 60 80 21. 20. 19. 18. 17. 16. 15. 14. t - t0 HdaysLB à SN2005M Hz = 0.0256L æ SN2004ef Hz = 0.0298L ô SN2006D Hz = 0.00964L Figure 4. Observed sampling of apparent magnitude B band light curves from two Branch-normal (SN2004ef and SN2006D) and one 1991T-like (SN2005M) SNe Ia.[27] Notice that a simple visual inspection of the light curves does not allow determining the subtypes. With given source and detector, we can display the visual representation of the function fλ(λ, t) by means of what we will call the spectral surface. In ﬁgure 6, for instance, we show a representation of this surface, constructed from Nugent’s estimates based on real SNe Ia data,[28] for ﬁxed z, r and Lλ (cf. section 3). The spectral surface displays in one single frame both the time evolution of the spectrum and the wavelength dependence of the speciﬁc light curve. The spectrum of the source, at a given time t∗, is the intersection of the spectral surface with the plane t = t∗, and the speciﬁc light curve, at a given wavelength λ∗, is the intersection of the spectral surface with the plane λ = λ∗. A spectral surface like the one shown in ﬁgure 6 would be the result of ideal 8 - 20 0 20 40 60 20. 19.5 19. 18.5 18. 17.5 17. 16.5 16. 15.5 t H daysLB+offset Figure 5. Theoretical B band light curve constructed from Nugent’s Branch-normal SN Ia spectral template.[28] observations of a SN, continuous both in wavelength and time. In practice the best we can do is a discrete sampling of that surface for a given SN; however, even this would be unfeasible for a high number of SNe, because of the time demanded for the observations and the need for high cost facilities. It is convenient to ﬁnd a relationship between ideal detected quantities and intrinsic (source rest-frame) ones in a cosmological spacetime. To that end, as a motivating warm-up, let us consider an imaginary spherical (2-dimensional) surface, of radius R, concentric with a light source, both at rest in an inertial frame of the Minkowski spacetime. The bolometric (raw or pure) ﬂux is deﬁned as f (t, R, Lλ) := ∫ ∞ 0 fλ(λ, t, R, Lλ) dλ , (5) and, due to conservation of energy, is trivially related to the intrinsic bolometric luminosity L(t) := ∫ ∞ 0 Lλ(λ, t) dλ♯ by: f (t, R, L) = L(t) 4πR2 . (6) We now introduce the concept of the redshift z, which is a measure of the relative velocity between astrophysical objects through the observation of their spectral features [29, 30]: z := (λobs − λem)/λem, where λem is the wavelength of a spectral feature, as measured in its rest frame, and λobs is the corresponding wavelength measured on Earth. In Appendix B we show an intuitive way to obtain the relation between ﬂux and luminosity for a more general spacetime, taking z into account, which is (B.4) fλ(λ, t, r, z, Lλ) = Lλ ( λ/(1 + z), t/(1 + z) ) (1 + z)34πr2 , (7) ♯ Bolometric ﬂux has the same units as band-limited ﬂux: 1 erg/cm2/s. 9 t (days) 0 20 40 60 80 λ ( ˚A) 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000fλ(10−9erg/cm2/s/˚A) 2 4 6 8 Figure 6. Theoretical rest-frame spectral surface generated from Nugent’s template of synthetic spectra, at diﬀerent epochs or phases, of a typical Branch-normal SN Ia.[28] We also show ﬁve typical spectra, projected onto a conveniently oﬀset plane t = −10 days, and ﬁve typical speciﬁc light curves, projected onto another conveniently oﬀset plane λ = 13000 ˚A. where Lλ( λ/(1 + z), t/(1 + z) ) is the speciﬁc luminosity in the source’s rest-frame. From speciﬁc ﬂux measures in diﬀerent wavelengths (or frequencies), in a given epoch, we can construct a spectrum of an astrophysical object. In ﬁgure 7, left panel, we show spectra of three SNe Ia, SN1994D,[31] SN1998aq[32] and SN2003du,[33] taken two days after maximum light (in B band, as we will see in the next sections), from the public database SUSPECT.[34] The characteristic shape of the spectral lines, known as P Cygni proﬁle, indicates the presence of an expanding gas cloud. For a gas expanding with spherical symmetry, part of the light that is emitted toward us is coming from regions that are moving in our direction and is blueshifted, and the other part comes from regions that are moving away from us, being therefore redshifted. Since diﬀerent layers of the expanding gas move with diﬀerent velocities, the resulting spectrum presents wide emission lines centered at the rest wavelenghth value. As an example of such lines, we can see two SiII absorption lines with rest-frame wavelengths λ ≈ 6347 ˚A and λ ≈ 6371 ˚A which appear in the spectrum in ﬁgure 7 as a broad absorption feature at λ ≈ 6150 ˚A (indicated by the dashed vertical line) followed by an emission line centered at λ ≈ 6350 ˚A. Based on the deﬁnition of apparent magnitude in a given ﬁlter, given by (3), we can introduce the concept of absolute magnitude, the apparent magnitude that the source 10 à à à à à à à à à à à æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ ô ô ô ô ô ô ô 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Λ HÅLfΛH10-14erg’cm2’s’ÅL à SN1994D Hz = 0.0024L æ SN1998aq Hz = 0.0037L ô SN2003du Hz = 0.0064L à à à à à à à à à à à æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ ô ô ô ô ô ô ô 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Λ HÅLfΛH10-14erg’cm2’s’ÅL à SN1994D Hz = 0L æ SN1998aq Hz = 0L ô SN2003du Hz = 0L Figure 7.

(8) We would like to call the reader’s attention to the fact that, by its very deﬁnition, it makes no sense to refer to an absolute magnitude for z ̸= 0, something that is not always explicit in the literature. We can also consider an ideal case, in which we could measure the ﬂux of a source in all wavelengths with a perfect detector (SX λ (λ) = 1, ∀λ), to deﬁne bolometric magnitudes, m(t, z) := −2.5 log     ∫ ∞ λ=0 fλ(λ, t, z)dλ ∫ ∞ λ=0 gλ(λ)dλ     , (9) M (t) := −2.5 log     ∫ ∞ λ=0 Lλ(λ, t) 4π(10pc)2 dλ ∫ ∞ λ=0 gλ(λ)dλ     . (10) †† The parsec is a distance unit frequently used in astronomy and corresponds to approximately 3.26 light-years or 3.08 × 1016 m. 1 parsec is the distance to an object with rest-frame size of 1 astronomical unit and apparent angular size of 1 arc second. 11 The distance to an astronomical object is directly related to its bolometric magnitudes through the quantity called distance modulus: µ := m − M. (11) As we will discuss in Section 3, the observed spectrum of a source is modiﬁed with respect to its intrinsic one by the redshift, and therefore the radiation emitted in a given wavelength range in the source’s rest frame will be observed in a diﬀerent range in the observer’s frame. Also, since we simply cannot measure bolometric magnitudes, but only magnitudes in some ﬁlters, it is useful to express the distance modulus in terms of ﬁlter magnitudes, which requires the introduction of the so called K-correction KXY deﬁned as KXY := mY − MX − µ. (12) A full discussion of K-corrections and their applications for cosmology are left by the authors to another paper. 3. Dependence of speciﬁc ﬂux on redshift and distance It is important to note that even for a class of objects with the same intrinsic luminosity, which is approximately the case of SNe Ia (apart from the variations mentioned in section 1), their observed ﬂuxes (both speciﬁc and bolometric) will diﬀer mainly due to the diﬀerent redshifts and distances. From (B.4) we can see that, at a given time t and at a given wavelength λ, the speciﬁc ﬂux can vary with distance r to the source, with redshift z, and with the functional form of the speciﬁc luminosity Lλ. Considering SNe Ia as standard candles means that we will assume all events to have the same speciﬁc luminosity. We know, however, that there are variations in their luminosities that should be taken into account and this will be considered in section 4. In the present section we will study how an arbitrary observed spectrum diﬀers from the source’s rest-frame spectrum, as we change, independently, the distance r and the redshift z. To that end, we advise the reader to refer now to Appendix A, where we graphically remind what happens to a function which is subjected to certain simple transformations that will be relevant in the next subsections. 3.1. Distance Let us analyze ﬁrst the simpler eﬀect, the one arising from distance changes only. From (B.4), we can see the dependence of the speciﬁc ﬂux on the inverse square of the distance r. Thus, when r ↦−→ r′ = cr (c = const.) , (13) all other independent variables held constant, we have that fλ(λ, t, r, z, Lλ) ↦−→ f ′ λ(λ, t, r′, z, Lλ) = c−2 fλ(λ, t, r, z, Lλ) . (14) 12 Therefore, in a graph of the spectrum, as shown in ﬁgure 8 for SN1994D, we employ, in a linear scale (left panel), the vertical distortion of (A.3) and, in a logarithmic scale (right panel), the vertical translation of (A.1). The eﬀect on the spectrum of a pure change only in distance is manifest in the logarithmic scale, where the rigid vertical translation is obvious. à à à à à à à à à à à à à à æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô 4000 5000 6000 7000 0 5 10 15 20 25 Λ HÅLfΛH10-14erg’cm2’s’ÅL à SN1994D, r = dSN Hreal spectrumL æ SN1994D, r = 2 dSN ô SN1994D, r = 3 dSN à à à à à à à à à à à à à à æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô 4000 5000 6000 7000 0.05 0.10 0.50 1.00 5.00 10.00 Λ HÅLfΛH10-14erg’cm2’s’ÅL à SN1994D, r = dSN Hreal spectrumL æ SN1994D, r = 2 dSN ô SN1994D, r = 3 dSN Figure 8. Synthetic spectra simulating the eﬀect of distance on the spectrum of SN Ia 1994D, taken 2 days after maximum in the B band, in linear (left panel) and logarithmic (right panel) scales. The same spectrum was divided by diﬀerent constants in order simulate diﬀerent distances (cf. (B.4)). 3.2. Redshift Let us analyze now the eﬀect of the redshift, related to the relative motion between source and observer. Again, from (B.4), we can see the dependence of the speciﬁc ﬂux on the inverse cube of (1 + z) and also modifying explicitly the independent variables λ, and t by factors of 1/(1 + z). Thus, when 1 + z ↦−→ 1 + z′ = c(1 + z) (c = const.) , (15) all other independent variables held constant, we have that fλ(λ, t, r, z, Lλ) ↦−→ f ′ λ(λ, t, r, z′, Lλ) = c−3 fλ ( λ c , t c , r, z, Lλ ) . (16) Of course, referring to the Appendix, we see that this transformation of the speciﬁc ﬂux involves the composition of a vertical distortion, (A.3), and a horizontal distortion, (A.4). To get a handle on it more intuitively, let us choose z = 0 so that the former equation will provide the redshifted spectrum from the rest-frame one: f ′ λ(λ, t, r, z′, Lλ) = 1 (1 + z′)3 fλ ( 1 1 + z′ λ, 1 1 + z′ t, r, z = 0, Lλ ) , (17) 13 or vice versa, the rest-frame spectrum from the redshifted one: fλ(λ, t, r, z = 0, Lλ) = (1 + z′) 3 f ′ λ( (1 + z′)λ, (1 + z′)t, r, z′, Lλ ) . (18) Now, to illustrate this redshifting eﬀect in a most pristine situation, we apply (17) to a top-hat function. The result is shown in ﬁgure 9. In the left panel, we show that the 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Λ HÅLfΛHerg’cm2’s’ÅL Rest frame Hz = 0L Redshifted frame Hz = 0.5L 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Λ HÅLfΛHerg’cm2’s’ÅL Rest frame Hz = 0L Redshifted frame Hz = 0.5L Figure 9. Eﬀect of a variation in redshift on two top-hat spectra. The blue curve is the rest-frame spectrum (z = 0) and the red one is same spectrum at a redshift z = 0.5, in the observer’s frame. total qualitative eﬀect of the redshift is: (i) a vertical squeezing, due to the 1/(1 + z′) 3 pre-factor, and (ii) a horizontal stretch caused by the rescaling λ ↦−→ λ/(1 + z′) in the ﬁrst argument of fλ. From this panel, the reader could naively be induced to regard the displacement towards greater wavelengths as a third, independent, eﬀect; however, as can be seen from the right panel of ﬁgure 9, such a displacement is in fact also due to the horizontal stretch, which leaves the vertical y-axis (λ = 0) ﬁxed (cf. (A.4) and right lower panel of ﬁgure A1). In ﬁgure 7, left panel, we showed observed spectra of three SNe Ia. In its right panel, we now show the corresponding rest-frame (z = 0) spectra. We can notice the small horizontal displacement of the spectral lines (blueshifted, towards the left) but it is not possible to visualize the vertical displacement (upwards) due to the low values of the redshift involved. We can also see that, even after the redshift correction, the spectra do not coincide and this is because each SN is at a diﬀerent distance from us. To explicitly reveal the redshifting eﬀect on the spectrum of a concrete SN Ia, we show, in ﬁgure 10, three spectra of SN 1994D, the rest-frame one and two other (artiﬁcial) high redshift ones (left panel). In particular, the eﬀect of the pre-factor 1/(1 + z′) 3 in (17) can be best viewed using a logarithmic scale (right panel), in which it becomes a simple vertical translation (cf. (A.1) and left upper panel of ﬁgure A1). 14 à à à à à à à à à à à à à àæ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ ô ô ô ô ô 4000 5000 6000 7000 5 10 15 20 25 Λ HÅLfΛH10-14erg’cm2’s’ÅL à SN1994D Hz = 0L æ SN1994D Hz = 0.2L ô SN1994D Hz = 0.4L à à à à à à à à à à à à à àæ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ ô ô ô ô ô 4000 5000 6000 7000 1.0 10.0 5.0 2.0 20.0 3.0 1.5 15.0 7.0 Λ HÅLfΛH10-14erg’cm2’s’ÅL à SN1994D Hz = 0L æ SN1994D Hz = 0.2L ô SN1994D Hz = 0.4L Figure 10.

In this section we will show that it is possible to make them even more similar by applying some simple operations, which are dubbed standardization, and we will apply this procedure to a sample of real type Ia SNe. The process of standardization became possible after the discovery that intrinsically brighter SNe (at B band maximum) were also the ones with wider light curves.[35, 36] Such a correlation rendered it possible to determine if a given SN was brighter (fainter) than another one either because it was closer (further) or because it was intrinsically brighter (dimmer), just by looking at their light curves. The data used in this work are publically available,[37] and constitute the sample of 85 low redshift SNe Ia observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP).[27, 38] Motivated by the higher uniformity of SNe Ia in the infra-red band, one of the main goals of that project was to obtain particularly well sampled and well characterized light curves both in optical and near-infrared bands, which should improve the eﬃciency of the standardization process. We restricted ourselves to the subsample of only Branch- normal SNe Ia, which reduced the number of events to 71. The corrections that we will present here were originally done simultaneously through a single ﬁt that yields all the correction factors for each SN (cf. Goldhaber et al. [39]); however we chose to implement them step by step in order to make clear the role of each one in the ﬁnal result. 15 ç ç ççççççççççççççççççç ççç ççç ç çççç çç çççç ç ç ç æ æ æ æ æ æ ææææææææææ ææææææ ææ æ ææææææ æææææ æ æ ò òòòòòòòò òòòòò òò ò òò ò òòòò ò ò ò ò òò óóóóóóóó óóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóó ó óóóóóóó ó ó óóó óóóóóóóó óóó ó ó ó óóó àà àà à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à àà à à ááá á áá áá áá á á á á á á á á á ô ô ô ôô ôô ô ô ô ô ô ô * * * **** * * * ** * ** * * ** * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * ´ ´ ´ ´ ´ ´´ ´ ´´ ´´ ´ ´´ ´ ´ ´ ´ ´´ ´´´ ´´´ ´ øøøøøø ø ø ø øø ø ø ø øø øø øøø ø øøø í í íííí í íí íí í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í ì ì ì ìì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ììì ì ì \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 Å ÅÅÅ Å ÅÅÅ ÅÅ Å Å Å Å Å ÅÅÅÅ ÅÅÅÅ Å Å Å Å Å Å Å Å Å +++ + + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä ÄÄ Ä ÄÄÄ Ä ÄÄÄ Ä ž ž ž ž ž žž ž žž ž žžžžžž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž - 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 22. 21. 20. 19. 18. 17. 16. 15. 14. 13. 12.

Apparent magnitude B band light curves of the 17 SNe Ia in our subsample after the time axis oﬀset correction (cf. subsection 4.1). 4.1. Time axis oﬀset correction In the CSP light curve data, the epoch is expressed in Modiﬁed Julian Date (MJD). In order to compare them in a single plot, we need to deﬁne a common time scale t − t0†, where t0 is the epoch of maximum ﬂux, traditionally considered in B band. We wrote a simple code to obtain t0 for each supernova in our subsample. Unfortunately, some of them were observed only after B band maximum and were thus excluded from our subsample, which reduced considerably the number of SNe in the ﬁnal subsample. In fact, we required our code to keep only the SNe that presented at least 3 observations taken before maximum ﬂux and at least one observation taken after 30 days from maximum ﬂux (the reason for this restriction will become clear in section 4.3). This left us with a subsample of 17 SNe, whose names and redshifts are listed in table 2, and whose time-oﬀset-corrected light curves can be seen in ﬁgure 11. 4.2. Distance and redshift corrections In order to properly standardize the light curves, we need to correct them for extrinsic eﬀects. As we have seen in section 3, two of them can be easily taken account of: distance and redshift. The latter entails a change of the time scale and an oﬀset to the magnitude (or change of the ﬂux normalization) whereas the former implies a simple oﬀset to the magnitude. Thus the correction for both eﬀects amounts to: (i) a (horizontal) dilation, cf. (A.4), of the time axis such that ∆to ∆te = 1 + z, (19) † The time scale t − t0 is commonly called phase. 16 Table 2.

(ii) a (vertical) rigid translation, cf. (A.1), of the magnitude axis. Notice that after the rigid vertical translations to correct for the redshift and distance, it is possible that the peaks of the light curves still do not coincide, since there can be absolute magnitude diﬀerences among them. So, in order to make the peaks coincide, a third vertical rigid translation is still needed. In our case, we do not know the distances to the SNe in our sample, so what we actually did was to evaluate the peak magnitude’s mean, and displace the light curves in order to make their magnitudes match this mean. This operation accounts for the rigid vertical translations due to both the redshift and the distance corrections, and also to a third rigid translation to correct for other diﬀerences in absolute magnitude. The resulting distance- and redshift-corrected light curves of our subsample are shown in ﬁgure 12. In order to display all SNe in their rest frame time, notice that we have chosen to change the x-axis from t − t0 to (t − t0)/(1 + z). Because of this, a little bit of care must be taken when comparing ﬁgure 12 and the following ﬁgures in this section to the results presented in section 3 and Appendix A, where we are keeping the x-axis unchanged before and after a given transformation. 17 ç ç ç ç ç ççççççççç çç ç ç ç ç ç ç ç ç ç ç ç ç ççç ç çç çç ç ç ç ç ç æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æææææææææ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ æ ææ æ æææ æææææ æ æ ò ò òòòòòòò òòòòò òò ò òò ò òòòò ò ò ò ò òò ó ó óóóóóó óóóóóóóóóóó óó ó ó óó ó óó óóóó ó ó ó óóó óóóóóóóó óóó ó ó ó óóó àà àà à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à à á áá á áá áá á á á á á á á á á á á ô ô ô ôô ôô ô ô ô ô ô ô * * * **** * * * ** * ** * * ** * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * ´ ´ ´ ´ ´ ´´ ´ ´´ ´´ ´ ´ ´ ´ ´ ´ ´ ´´ ´´´ ´´´ ´ ø øøøøø ø ø ø ø ø ø ø ø øø øø øøø ø øøø í í íííí í íí íí í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í ì ì ì ìì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ì ììì ì ì \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 Å ÅÅÅ Å ÅÅÅ ÅÅ Å Å Å Å Å ÅÅÅÅ ÅÅÅÅ Å Å Å Å Å Å Å Å Å + ++ + + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä Ä ÄÄ Ä Ä ÄÄÄ Ä ž ž ž ž ž žž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž ž - 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 21. 20. 19. 18. 17. 16. 15.

Apparent magnitude B band light curves + oﬀset for the 17 SNe in our subsample after the time axis oﬀset (cf. subsection 4.1) and distance and redshift corrections (cf. sunsection 4.2). 4.3. The stretch correction The stretch parameter s is related to the width of the light curve, i.e. it measures how fast the supernova’s ﬂux decreases (or its magnitude increases).[12, 39] In order to calculate the stretch, we need to adopt a ﬁducial curve which, in our case, was chosen to be simply the mean of all curves in the sample, and assign the value s = 1 to it. A curve that declines slower (faster) than the ﬁducial one will have s > 1 (s < 1). After the corrections described in subsections 4.1 and 4.2 all curves coincide at the B band maximum but not necessarily at any other point. The stretch correction is designed so that the curves also coincide at 15 source frame days after B band maximum. We show a sketch of this procedure in ﬁgure 13, in which we use a ﬁducial (red curve) and two ﬁcticious light curves, 1 and 2, in blue. To obtain the stretch we need to solve for pi = (t − t0,i)/(1 + zi) from the following equation fi(pi) = m15, (20) where fi is an interpolating function (in our case a spline) for the i-th SN Ia B band light curve, and m15 is the value of B (+ oﬀset) of the mean light curve at pi = 15 days. Thus, the stretch can be written as si = pi 15 days . (21) We can then divide all phases of a supernova by the obtained stretch so the curves coincide at phase 15 days. As mentioned earlier, the width diﬀerence in the light curves is associated to their intrinsic brightness (broader ↔ brighter). When we correct for the stretch we are compensating the diﬀerences in intrinsic brightness between the supernovae. 18 - 10 0 10 20 30 40 20. 19.5 19. 18.5 18. 17.5 17. 16.5 16. 15.5 H t - t0 L ’ H 1 + z L H daysLB+offsetm15 1 H s < 1L 2 H s > 1L p1 p 2 Figure 13.

The red dotted horizontal line indicates the position of m15 in the y-axis, which corresponds to the point in the ﬁducial curve where (t − t0)/(1 + z) = 15 days, marked with the red dotted vertical line. The blue dashed curves are two other ﬁctitious light curves, upon which we want to apply the stretch correction. The two blue dotted lines show the values of p for each curve, and the resulting range of the stretch factor is indicated near each curve. The result of the application of the stretch procedure to our sample can be seen in ﬁgure 14. Table 2 shows the values of the stretch s found for each SN, according to our procedure. For comparison, we also show the values of the same parameter, now dubbed sG, found using the method described in Goldhaber et al.,[39] where the corrections are all done simultaneously and the ﬁducial curve is diﬀerent from ours. We can see that the results obtained with our step-by-step method agree quite well with the ones obtained with this more sophisticated ﬁtting recipe. 4.4. The resulting template After we apply all the corrections discussed above we can construct what we can call a “rudimentary” template, a simple mean of all corrected curves, that can be compared to the Nugent template, one of the most used in the literature.[28] We show the comparison in ﬁgure 15. In this comparison we can not use the relative discrepancy between these curves ( (BN − ¯B)/BN or (BN − ¯B)/ ¯B ) because the normalizations of both are arbitrary. We can, on the other hand, compare the absolute diﬀerence shown in ﬁgure 15 (lower panel) to the range of the Nugent template in the depicted interval ([−10, 30]), for instance, which is 2.5, and the discrepancy thus calculated is always less than 12%. We can see that, despite the simpliﬁed analysis performed here, our curve looks quite similar to the template, which shows the consistency between our template and the Nugent one. We show in ﬁgure 16 the standard deviation of our sample before and after the stretch correction.

Lower panel: discrepancy between the standard deviations in magnitude of our subsample after all corrections (including the stretch one) and before the (last) stretch correction. after the maximum is clear from ﬁgure 16 . Since such gain is obtained through a simple linear transformation, with only one parameter, we can argue that it reﬂects the homogeneity of the light curves in our sample The reader might note that the discrepancy between the standard deviation after the stretch correction (in ﬁgure 16) is greater before maximum. This feature reﬂects the fact that the dispersion of the SNe Ia is smaller before the maximum (see Hayden et al.[40]). The stretch is deﬁned to decrease the dispersion after maximum but it is applied to the whole light curve through (A.4) therefore, since the curves are more uniform before the maximum, when we multiply their arguments by diﬀerent numbers the net result is an increasing of the dispersion in this interval. 5. Conclusion This article had two main aims: (i) presenting and clarifying some fundamental concepts and results related to the cosmological use of SNe Ia, and (ii) building a simple SN Ia light curve template. The ﬁrst aim led us to introduce, in section 2, the speciﬁc ﬂux or spectral energy distribution as the principal quantity characterizing the class of transient SNe Ia, and the corresponding projections (spectra and speciﬁc light curves). In section 3, we studied 21 in particular its dependence on distance and redshift and the consequent impact on the observed ﬂuxes or magnitudes. To comply with the second aim cited above, in section 4, we built our naive light curve template, for didactic purposes, through a simpliﬁed version of the original stretch procedure: we performed the determination of the three parameters of the method (the overall normalization of the light curve, the epoch of maximum ﬂux in B band and the stretch itself) separately, instead of the simultaneous ﬁt described in Goldhaber et al..[39] We ﬁnally constructed a mean light curve after the application of the method and compared it to a light curve template much used in the literature,[28] showing that our simpliﬁed method is able to produce a template very similar to it. In fact, the discrepancy is less than 10−2 for most of the phases in the interval of [−10, 70] days in the light curve (see ﬁgure 15). From this very simple exercise we can infer how uniform the population of Branch-normal SNe Ia really is, since it is possible to decrease considerably the rest-frame magnitude standard deviation (after the maximum ﬂux) of the light curves in our sample using just the single stretch parameter (cf. ﬁgure 16). It is worth noting that after the discovery of the correlation between SN Ia luminosities and the width of their light curves, other secondary empirical correlations were also discovered, such as the one between a SN Ia luminosity and its color [41, 42] (the brightest SNe Ia are also the bluest ones). The process of standardization nowadays is, therefore, done through computational codes such as SALT2 [43] and MLCS2k2,[44] which take into account all these correlations. Our current analysis does not yet address the relationship between the stretch parameter and the actual absolute value of the peak luminosity of SNe Ia, which is a necessary step for their use as extragalactic distance indicators. We leave this step for a future paper, which will take into account the cosmological applications of what has been presented here.

Basic function transformations In this Appendix we investigate four simple transformations (of one real parameter c on an arbitrary function f : x ↦−→ y = f (x) which bear upon the changes on the speciﬁc ﬂux due to distance and redshift (cf. section 3). These are (cf. ﬁgure A1): (i) vertical translation TV,c: TV,cf : x ↦−→ y := f (x) + c . (A.1) It always rigidly translates, along the vertical y-axis, the graph of the function f , by c “units”: upwards, if c > 0, and downwards, if c < 0. 22 (ii) horizontal translation TH,c: TH,cf : x ↦−→ y := f (x + c) . (A.2) It always rigidly translates, along the horizontal x-axis, the graph of the function f , by c “units”: left, if c > 0, and right, if c < 0. (iii) vertical distortion DV,c: DV,cf : x ↦−→ y := cf (x) . (A.3) It always distorts, along the vertical y-axis, the graph of the function f , keeping a point with vanishing y coordinate ﬁxed: if |c| > 1, it represents a dilation or stretch, the more so the larger |c| is, whereas if 0 < |c| < 1, it represents a contraction or compression, the more so the smaller |c| is. Furthermore, if c < 0, this distortion is also accompanied by a reﬂection of the graph with respect to the x-axis. (iv) horizontal distortion DH,c: DH,cf : x ↦−→ y := f (cx) . (A.4) It always distorts, along the horizontal x-axis, the graph of the function f , keeping a point with vanishing x coordinate ﬁxed: if |c| > 1, it represents a contraction or compression, the more so the larger |c| is, whereas if 0 < |c| < 1, it represents a dilation or stretch, the more so the smaller |c| is. Furthermore, if c < 0, this distortion is also accompanied by a reﬂection of the graph with respect to the y-axis. Appendix B. Obtaining the relation between speciﬁc ﬂux and speciﬁc luminosity Let us now proceed to the generalization of (5) to the Robertson-Walker spacetime, whose line element may be cast in the form: ds2 = −c2dt 2 + a(t) 2 [ dr2 1 − kr2 + r2 ( dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ 2)] , (B.1) where k is the spatial curvature and a(t) is the dimensionless scale factor. The coordinate r is variously called the comoving areal distance, transverse comoving distance or proper motion distance.[45, 46] We ﬁrst deal with the traditional case in which source and detector are both in the Hubble ﬂow, so that their relative velocity is all due to the cosmic expansion, and is traditionally called a recession velocity. In this case, time intervals dtS in the source’s rest-frame, such as the time between the emission of two consecutive photons, correspond to time intervals in the detector’s frame dtD = (1+¯z) dtS, where ¯z is the usual cosmological redshift: 1 + ¯z = 1/a(t). The source-frame and detector-frame energies of the photon will also be related by a factor (1 + ¯z). Therefore, assuming conservation of photons, the bolometric ﬂux of a source at cosmological redshift ¯z can be written as f (t, r, ¯z, L) = L ( t/(1 + ¯z) ) 4πr2(1 + ¯z)2 , (B.2) 23 −4 −2 0 2 −5 0 5 y = f (x) y = TV,c=2f (x) := f (x) + 2 −4 −2 0 2 −5 0 5 y = f (x) y = TH,c=2f (x) := f (x + 2) −4 −2 0 2 −5 0 5 y = f (x) y = DV,c=2f (x) := 2f (x) −4 −2 0 2 −5 0 5 y = f (x) y = DH,c=2f (x) := f (2x) Figure A1. Basic transformations of a given arbitrary function f : the original graph is represented by a (blue) dashed line and the transformed graph by a (red) solid line. Left upper panel displays the eﬀect of a vertical translation TV,c with c = 2. Right upper panel displays the eﬀect of a horizontal translation TH,c with c = 2. Lower left panel displays the eﬀect of a vertical distortion DV.c with c = 2. Lower right panel displays the eﬀect of a horizontal distortion DH.c with c = 2. where t is a time coordinate measured with respect to a reference time tR which, for simplicity, we choose to be tR = 0 in both frames. In this way, a time interval t − tR = t in the observer’s frame corresponds to the interval (t − tR)/(1 + ¯z) = t/(1 + ¯z) in the source’s rest-frame. Finally, we state that an equation of this same form holds for an arbitrary motion (not in the Hubble ﬂow) of the source and the detector, viz., f (t, r, z, L) = L ( t/(1 + z) ) 4πr2(1 + z)2 , (B.3) where now z is the total redshift between the source and the detector, which is the really observed one‡ Since the speciﬁc ﬂux is related to the bolometric one by (5), it is obvious ‡ This demonstration, besides some alternative deﬁnitions of luminosity distance, and its consequences for SNe Ia, will be explored in a forthcoming paper, in preparation. 24 that it can be expressed as fλ(λ, t, r, z, Lλ) = Lλ ( λ/(1 + z), t/(1 + z) ) (1 + z)34πr2 , (B.4) where Lλ( λ/(1 + z), t/(1 + z) ) is the speciﬁc luminosity in the source’s rest-frame. We can also obtain the frequency representation of the speciﬁc ﬂux as fν(ν, t, r, z, Lν) = Lν ( ν(1 + z), t/(1 + z) ) (1 + z)4πr2 . (B.5) We can obtain (6) by integrating either B.4) on λ or (B.5) on ν. References [1] Hoyle F and Fowler W A 1960 Nucleosynthesis in Supernovae Astrophys. J. 132 565.
