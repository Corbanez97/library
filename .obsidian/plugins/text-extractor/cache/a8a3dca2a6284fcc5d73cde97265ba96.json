Introduction The discovery of the acceleration of the Universe stands as a major breakthrough of observational cosmology. Surveys of cosmologically distant Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) indicated the presence of a new, unaccounted-for “dark energy” that opposes the self-attraction of matter and causes the expansion of the Universe to accel- erate. When combined with indirect measurements using cos- mic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, cosmic shear and studies of galaxy clusters, a cosmological world model has emerged that describes the Universe as ﬂat, with about 70% of its energy contained in the form of this cosmic dark energy (see for example Seljak et al. 2005). Current projects aim at directly probing the nature of the dark energy via a determination of its equation of state pa- rameter – the pressure to energy-density ratio – w ≡ pX/ρX, which also deﬁnes the time dependence of the dark energy den- sity: ρX ∼ a−3(1+w), where a is the scale factor. Recent con- straints on w (Knop et al. 2003; Tonry et al. 2003; Barris et al. 2004; Riess et al. 2004) are consistent with a very wide range of Dark Energy models. Among them, the historical cosmolog- ical constant (w = −1) is 10120 to 1060 smaller than plausible vacuum energies predicted by fundamental particle theories. It also cannot explain why matter and dark energy have compara- ble densities today. “Dynamical Λ” models have been proposed (quintessence, k-essence) based on speculative ﬁeld models, and some predict values of w above -0.8 – signiﬁcantly diﬀer- ent from -1. Measuring the average value of w with a precision better than 0.1 will permit a discrimination between the null hypothesis (pure cosmological constant, w = −1) and some dynamical dark energy models. Improving signiﬁcantly over current SN constraints on the dark energy requires a ten-fold larger sample (i.e. o(1000) at 0.2 < z < 1., where w is best measured), in order to signiﬁ- cantly improve on statistical errors but also, most importantly, on systematic uncertainties. The traditional method of measur- ing distances to SNe Ia involves diﬀerent types of observations at about 10 diﬀerent epochs spread over nearly 3 months: dis- covery via image subtraction, spectroscopic identiﬁcation, and photometric follow-up, usually on several telescopes. Many ob- jects are lost or poorly measured in this process due to the ef- fects of inclement weather during the follow-up observations, and the analysis often subject to largely unknown systematic uncertainties due to the use of various instruments and tele- scopes. P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set 3 Field RA(2000) Dec (2000) 4 P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set fringe-correction frames are constructed from all available data from the entire MegaCam run (including PI data). The Elixir process consists of ﬂat-ﬁelding and fringe subtraction, with an approximate astrometric solution also derived. Elixir provides reduced data which has a uniform photometric response across the mosaic (at the expense of a non-uniform sky background). This “photometric ﬂat-ﬁeld” correction is constructed using ex- posures with large dithers obtained on dense stellar ﬁelds. The SNLS pipelines then associate a weight map with each Elixir-processed image (i.e. each CCD from a given exposure) from the ﬂat-ﬁeld frames and the sky background variations. Bad pixels (as identiﬁed by Elixir), cosmic rays (detected using the Laplacian ﬁlter of van Dokkum 2001), satellite trails, and saturated areas are set to zero in the weight maps. An object catalog is then produced using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), and point-like objects are used to derive an image quality (IQ) estimate. The sky background map computed by SExtractor is then subtracted from the image. We addi- tionally perform aperture photometry on the objects of the SExtractor catalog for the purpose of photometric calibration (see Section 4). 3.2. Measurement of supernova ﬂuxes For each supernova candidate, the image with the best IQ (sub- sequently called “reference”) is identiﬁed, and all other images (both science images and their weight maps) are resampled to the pixel grid deﬁned by this reference. The variations of the Jacobian of the geometrical transformations, which translate into photometric non-uniformities in the re-sampled images, are suﬃciently small (below the millimag level) to be ignored. We then derive the convolution kernels that would match the PSF (modeled using the DAOPHOT package Stetson 1987) of the reference image to the PSF of the other resampled science images, but we do not perform the convolutions. These con- volution kernels not only match the PSFs, but also contain the photometric ratios of each image to the reference. We ensure that these photometric ratios are spatially uniform by imposing a spatially uniform kernel integral, but allow for spatial ker- nel shape variations as the images may have spatially varying PSFs. Following Alard (2000), the kernel is ﬁt on several hun- dred objects selected for their high, though unsaturated, peak ﬂux. The kernel ﬁt is made more robust by excluding objects with large residuals and iterating. Our approach to the diﬀerential ﬂux measurement of a SN is to simultaneously ﬁt all images in a given ﬁlter with a model that includes (i) a spatially variable galaxy (constant with time), and (ii) a time-variable point source (the super- nova). The model is described in detail in Fabbro (2001). The shape of the galaxy and positions of both galaxy and supernova are ﬁt globally. The intensity Di,p in a pixel p of image i is modeled as: Di,p = [( fiPre f + g) ⊗ ki] p + bi (1) where fi are the supernova ﬂuxes, Pre f is the PSF of the refer- ence image centered on the SN position; ki is the convolution kernel that matches the PSF of the reference image to the PSF of image i; g is the intensity of the host galaxy in the refer- ence image, and bi is a local (sky) background in image i. The non parametric galaxy “model” g is made of independent pix- els which represent the galaxy in the best IQ image. All ﬂuxes ( fi) are expressed in units of the reference image ﬂux. The ﬁt parameters are: the supernova position and the galaxy pixel values (common to all images), the supernova ﬂuxes, and a constant sky background (diﬀerent for each im- age). In some images in the series, the supernova ﬂux is known to be absent or negligible; these frames enter the ﬁt as “zero ﬂux images” and are thus used to determine the values of the galaxy pixels. The least-squares photometric ﬁt minimizes: χ 2 = ∑ i,p Wi,p (Di,p − Ii,p)2 (2) where Ii,p and Wi,p are the image and weight values of pixel p in image i, and the sums run over all images that contain the SN position, and all pixels in the ﬁtted stamp of this image. Note that this method does not involve any real image con- volution: the ﬁtted model possesses the PSF of the reference image, and it is the model that is convolved to match the PSF of every other image. We typically ﬁt 50x50 galaxy pixels and several hundred images, and each SN ﬁt usually has 2000 to 3000 parameters. The ﬁt is run once, 5σ outlier pixels are re- moved, and the ﬁt is run again. The photometric ﬁt yields values of the ﬁt parameters along with a covariance matrix. There are obvious correlations be- tween SN ﬂuxes and galaxy brightness, between these two pa- rameters and the background level, and between the SN posi- tion and the ﬂux, for any given image. More importantly, the uncertainty in the SN position and the galaxy brightness intro- duces correlations between ﬂuxes at diﬀerent epochs that have to be taken into account when analyzing the light-curves. Note that ﬂux variances and the correlations between ﬂuxes decrease when adding more “zero ﬂux images” into the ﬁt. It will there- fore be possible to derive an improved photometry for most of the events presented in this paper, when the ﬁelds are observed again and more images without SN light are available. 3.3. Flux uncertainties Once the photometric ﬁt has converged, the parameter covari- ance matrix (including ﬂux variances and covariances) is de- rived. This Section addresses the accuracy of these uncertain- ties, in particular the ﬂux variances and covariances, which are used as inputs to the subsequent light-curve ﬁt. The normalization of the parameter covariance matrix di- rectly reﬂects the normalization of image weights. We checked that the weights are on average properly normalized because the minimum χ 2 per degree of freedom is very close to 1 (we ﬁnd 1.05 on average). However, this does not imply mathe- matically that the ﬂux uncertainties are properly normalized, because equation (2) neglects the correlations between neigh- boring pixels introduced by image re-sampling. We considered accounting for these correlations; however, this would make the ﬁtting code intolerably slow, as the resulting χ 2 would be non-diagonal. Using approximate errors in least squares (such as ignoring correlations) increases the actual variance of the P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set 5 estimators, but in the case considered here, the loss in photo- metric accuracy is below 1%. The real drawback of ignoring pixel correlations is that parameter uncertainties extracted from the ﬁt are underestimated (since pixel correlations are posi- tive); this is a product of any photometry method that assumes uncorrelated pixels on re-sampled or convolved images. Our geometric alignment technique, used to align images prior to the ﬂux measurement as described in Section 3.2, uses a 3x3 pixel quadratic re-sampling kernel, which produces output pix- els with an average variance of 80% of the input pixel variance, where the remaining 20% contributes to covariance in nearby pixels. We checked that ﬂux variances (and covariances) com- puted assuming independent pixels are also underestimated by the same amount: on average, a 25% increase is required. In order to derive accurate uncertainties, we used the fact that for each epoch, several images are available which mea- sure the same object ﬂux. Estimating ﬂuxes on individual ex- posures rather than on stacks per night preserves the photomet- ric precision since a common position is ﬁt using all images. It also allows a check on the consistency of ﬂuxes measured within a night. We therefore ﬁt a common ﬂux per night to the ﬂuxes measured on each individual image by minimizing a χ 2 n (where n stands for nights); this matrix is non-diagonal because the diﬀerential photometry produces correlated ﬂuxes. The χ 2 n contribution of every individual image is evaluated, and out- liers > 5σ (due to, for example, unidentiﬁed cosmic rays) are discarded; this cut eliminates 1.4% of the measurements on av- erage. The covariance of the per-night ﬂuxes is then extracted, and normalized so that the minimum χ 2 n per degree of freedom is 1. This translates into an “eﬀective” ﬂux uncertainty derived from the scatter of repeated observations rather than from ﬁrst principles. If the only source of noise (beyond photon statistics) were pixel correlations introduced by image resampling, we would expect an average χ 2 n/Ndo f of 1.25, as all ﬂux variances are on average under-estimated by 25%. Our average value is 1.55; hence we conclude that our photometric uncertainties are only ∼ 12% ( √ 6 P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set Band P.

The dispersion is below 1% in gM, rM and iM, and about 1.5% in zM. by a very small scatter in these photometric ratios (typically 0.2%); again the averaging was robust, with 5-σ deviations re- jected. Observations of the Landolt standard star ﬁelds were processed in the same manner, though their ﬂuxes were not averaged. The apertures were chosen suﬃciently large (about 6′′ in diameter) to bring the variations of aperture corrections across the mosaic below 0.005 mag. However, since ﬂuxes are measured in the same way and in the same apertures in science images and standard star ﬁelds, we did not apply any aperture correction. Using standard star observations, we ﬁrst determined zero- points by ﬁtting linear color transformations and zero-points to each night and ﬁlter, however with color slopes common to all nights. In order to account for possible non-linearities in the Landolt to MegaCam color relations, the observed color-color relations were then compared to synthetic ones derived from spectrophotometric standards. This led to shifts of roughly 0.01 in all bands other than gM, for which the shift was 0.03 due to the nontrivial relation to B and V. We then applied the zero-points appropriate for each night to the catalog of science ﬁeld stars of that same night. These magnitudes were averaged robustly, rejecting 5-σ outliers, and the average standard star observations were merged. Figure 3 shows the dispersion of the calibration residuals in the gM, rM, iM and zM bands. The observed standard deviation, which sets the upper bound to the repeatability of the photometric mea- surements, is about or below 0.01 mag in gM, rM and iM, and about 0.016 mag in zM. For each of the four SNLS ﬁelds, a catalog of tertiary standards was produced using the procedure described above. These catalogs were then used to calibrate the supernova ﬂuxes, as described in Section 3.4. The dominant uncertainty in the photometric scale of these catalogs comes from the determina- tion of the color-color relations of the standard star measure- ments. For the gM, rM and iM bands, a zero-point oﬀset of 0.01 mag would easily be detected; hence we took this value as a conservative uncertainty estimate. The zM band is aﬀected by a larger measurement noise, and it is calibrated with respect to I and R − I Landolt measurements. We therefore attributed to it a larger zero point uncertainty of 0.03 mag. The MegaCam shutter is designed to preserve the mosaic illumination uniformity. Nevertheless, the shutter precision is a potential source of systematic uncertainties, given (1) the pos- sible non uniformities due to the shutter motion and (2) the ex- posure time diﬀerences between the calibration images (a few seconds) and the science images (hundreds of seconds). For MegaCam, the actual exposure time is measured and reported for each exposure, using dedicated sensors. The shutter preci- sion was investigated by Cuillandre (2005) and it was shown that the non-uniformity due to the shutter is less than 0.3% across the mosaic. Short and long exposures of the same ﬁelds were also compared. The systematic ﬂux diﬀerences between the exposures were found to be below 1% (r.m.s). 4.2. The MegaCam and Landolt instrumental ﬁlters As the supernova ﬂuxes are measured in the instrumental ﬁl- ter system, the MegaCam transmission functions (up to an ar- bitrary constant) are needed in order to correctly interpret the SN photometry. Similarly, for the published nearby supernovae which are reported in Landolt magnitudes, the ﬁlter responses of the Landolt system are required. For the MegaCam ﬁlters, we used the measurements pro- vided by the manufacturer, multiplied by the CCD quantum eﬃciency, the MegaPrime wide-ﬁeld corrector transmission function, the CFHT primary mirror reﬂectivity, and the aver- age atmospheric transmission at Mauna Kea. As an additional check, we computed synthetic MegaCam-SDSS color terms us- ing the synthetic transmissions of the SDSS 2.5-m telescope (SDSS 2004b) and spectrophotometric standards taken from Pickles (1998) and Gunn & Stryker (1983). Since the SDSS science catalog (Finkbeiner et al. 2004; Raddick 2002; SDSS 2004a) shares thousands of objects with two of the four ﬁelds repeatedly observed with MegaCam, we were able to compare these synthetic color transformations with the observed trans- formations. We found a good agreement, with uncertainties at the 1% level. This constrains the central wavelengths of the MegaCam band passes to within 10 to 15 Å with respect to the SDSS 2.5m band passes. The choice of ﬁlter band passes to use for Landolt-based observations is not unique. Most previous supernova cosmol- ogy works assumed that the determinations of Bessell (1990) describe the eﬀective Landolt system well, although the author himself questions this fact, explicitly warning that the Landolt system “is not a good match to the standard system” – i.e. the historical Johnsons-Cousins system. Fortunately, Hamuy et al. (1992, 1994) provide spectrophotometric measurements of a 8 P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set few objects measured in Landolt (1992a); this enabled us to compare synthetic magnitudes computed using Bessell trans- missions with Landolt measurements of the same objects. This comparison reveals small residual color terms which vanish if the B, V, R and I Bessell ﬁlters are blue-shifted by 41, 27, 21 and 25 Å respectively. Furthermore, if one were to assume that the Bessell ﬁlters describe the Landolt system, this would lead to synthetic MegaCam-Landolt color terms signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the measured ones; the blue shifts determined above bring them into excellent agreement. We therefore as- sumed that the Landolt catalog magnitudes refer to blue-shifted Bessell ﬁlters, with a typical central wavelength uncertainty of 10 to 15 Å, corresponding roughly to a 0.01 accuracy for the color terms. 4.3. Converting magnitudes to ﬂuxes Given the variations with time of the cosmological scale factor a(t), one can predict the evolution with redshift of the observed ﬂux of classes of objects of reproducible luminosity though not necessarily known. This is why the cosmological conclusions that can be drawn from ﬂux measurements rely on ﬂux ratios of distant to nearby SNe, preferably measured in similar rest- frame pass-bands. The measured SNe magnitudes must there- fore be converted to ﬂuxes at some point in the analysis. The ﬂux in an imaginary rest-frame band of transmission Trest for a SN at redshift z is deduced from the magnitude m(Tobs) measured in an observer band of transmission Tobs via: f (z, Trest) = 10−0.4(m(Tobs)−mre f (Tobs)) × ∫ φS N(λ)Trest(λ)dλ P.

Light-curve ﬁt and cosmological analysis To derive the brightness, light-curve shape and SN color es- timates required for the cosmological analysis, the time se- quence of photometric measurements for each SN was ﬁt us- ing a SN light-curve model. This procedure is discussed in this section together with the nearby and distant SN Ia samples se- lection and the cosmological analysis. 5.1. The SN Ia light-curve model We ﬁt the SN Ia light-curves in two or more bands using the SALT light-curve model (Guy et al. 2005) which returns the supernova rest-frame B-band magnitude m∗ B, a single shape pa- rameter s and a single color parameter c. The supernova rest- frame B-band magnitude at the date of its maximum luminosity in B is deﬁned as: m∗ B = −2.5 log10   f (z, T ∗ B, t = tmax,B 10 P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set 5.3. Host galaxy extinction There is no consensus on how to correct for host galaxy ex- tinction aﬀecting high redshift SNe Ia. The pioneering SN cos- mology papers (Riess et al. 1998, Perlmutter et al. 1999) typi- cally observed in only one or two ﬁlters, and so had little or no color information with which to perform extinction corrections. Subsequent papers either selected low-extinction subsamples based on host galaxy diagnostics (Sullivan et al. 2003), or used multicolor information together with an assumed color of an unreddened SN to make extinction corrections on a subset of the data (Knop et al. 2003; Tonry et al. 2003). These techniques have their drawbacks: the intrinsic color of SNe Ia has some dispersion, and measured colors often have large statistical errors in high-redshift data sets. When these two color uncertainties are multiplied by the ratio of to- tal to selective absorption, RB ≃ 4, the resulting error can be very large. To circumvent this, some studies used Bayesian pri- ors (e.g. Riess et al. 1998; Tonry et al. 2003; Riess et al. 2004; Barris et al. 2004). Other authors argue that this biases the re- sults (e.g. Perlmutter et al. 1999; Knop et al. 2003). Here we employ a technique that makes use of color in- formation to empirically improve distance estimates to SNe Ia. We exploit the fact that the SN color acts in the same direc- tion as reddening due to dust – i.e. redder SNe are intrinsically dimmer, brighter SNe are intrinsically bluer (Tripp & Branch 1999). By treating the correction between color and brightness empirically, we avoid model-dependent assumptions that can both artiﬁcially inﬂate the errors and potentially lead to biases in the determination of cosmological parameters. Because we have more than one well-measured color for several SNe, we can perform consistency checks on this technique – distances from multiple colors should, and do, agree to a remarkable de- gree of precision (Section 6.3). 5.4. Cosmological ﬁts From the ﬁts to the light-curves (Section 5.1), we computed a rest-frame-B magnitude, which, for perfect standard candles, should vary with redshift according to the luminosity distance. This rest-frame-B magnitude refers to observed brightness, and therefore does not account for brighter-slower and brighter- bluer correlations (see Guy et al. 2005 and references therein). As a distance estimator, we use: µB = m∗ B − M + α(s − 1) − βc where m∗ B, s and c are derived from the ﬁt to the light curves, and α, β and the absolute magnitude M are parameters which are ﬁtted by minimizing the residuals in the Hubble diagram. The cosmological ﬁt is actually performed by minimizing: χ 2 = ∑ ob jects ( µB − 5 log10(dL(θ, z)/10pc))2 P.

The bottom plot shows the residuals for the best ﬁt to a ﬂat Λ cosmology. Using Monte Carlo realizations of our SN sample, we checked that our estimators of the cosmological parameters are unbiased (at the level of 0.1 σ), and that the quoted uncertain- ties match the observed scatter. We also checked the ﬁeld-to- ﬁeld variation of the cosmological analysis. The four ΩM val- ues (one for each ﬁeld, assuming Ωk = 0) are compatible at 37% conﬁdence level. We also ﬁtted separately the Ia and Ia* SNLS samples and found results compatible at the 75% conﬁ- dence level. We derive an intrinsic dispersion, σint = 0.13 ± 0.02, ap- preciably smaller than previously measured (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Tonry et al. 2003; Barris et al. 2004; Riess et al. 2004). The intrinsic dispersions of nearby only (0.15±0.02) and SNLS only (0.12±0.02) events are statistically consistent although SNLS events show a bit less dispersion.

The zM data is aﬀected by a low signal-to-noise ratio because of low quantum eﬃciency and high sky background. For z > 0.8, σ((B − V)rest f rame) ≃ 1.6σ(iM −zM), because the lever arm between the central wave- lengths of iM and zM is about 1.6 times lower than for B and V. Furthermore, errors in rest-frame color are scaled by a further factor of β ≃ 1.6 in the distance modulus estimate. With a typ- ical measurement uncertainty σ(zM) ≃ 0.1, we have a distance modulus uncertainty σ(µ) > 0.25. Since the fall 2004 semester, we now acquire about three times more zM data than for the data in the current paper, and this will improve the accuracy of future cosmological analyses. The distance model we use is linear in stretch and color. Excluding events at z > 0.8, where the color uncertainty is larger than the natural color dispersion, we checked that adding 12 P.

We hence conclude that the linear distance estimator accurately describes our sample. Since the distance estimator we use depends on the color parameter c, residuals to the Hubble Diagram are statistically correlated to c. The correlation becomes very apparent when the c measurement uncertainty dominates the distance uncer- tainty budget, as happens in our sample when z > 0.8. We checked that the measurement uncertainties can account for the observed residual-c correlation at z > 0.8. Because of this cor- relation, color selected sub-samples mechanically lead to bi- ased estimations of cosmological parameters. 6. Comparison of nearby and distant SN properties 6.1. Stretch and color distributions The distributions of the shape and color parameters – s and c as deﬁned in Section 5.1 – are compared in Figures 7 and 8 for nearby objects and for SNLS supernovae at z < 0.8 for which c is accurately measured. These distributions look very similar, both in central value and shape. The average values for the two samples diﬀer by about 1σ in stretch and 1.5σ in color: we ﬁnd that distant supernovae are on average slightly bluer and slower than nearby ones. The statistical signiﬁcance of the diﬀerences is low and the diﬀerences can easily be interpreted in terms of selection eﬀects rather than evolution. The evolution of average s and c parameters with redshift is shown in Section 7.4; stretch is not monotonic, and color seems to drift towards the blue with increasing redshift.

Brighter-slower and brighter-bluer relationships Figures 9 and 10 compare the nearby and distant samples in the stretch-magnitude and color-magnitude planes. There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between these samples. In Figure 8, two of the SNLS events (SNLS-04D1ag and SNLS-04D3oe) have a color value, c, smaller than −0.1. These supernovae are both classiﬁed as secure Ia. There are no SNe Ia in the nearby sample that are this blue. Figure 10 shows that these events lie on the derived brighter-bluer relation. Although they are brighter than average, ﬁtting with or without these two events changes the cosmological results by less than 0.1 σ. 6.3. Compatibility of SN colors The measurement of distances to high redshift SNLS SNe in- volves the rest-frame U band. The MegaCam rM band shifts from rest-frame B at z=0.5 to rest-frame U at z=0.8. Within this redshift range, distances are estimated mainly using iM and rM, the weight of zM being aﬀected by high photometric noise; P.

Our cosmological conclusions rely on having a consistent distance estimate when using rest-frame BV and U B. This property is tested in Guy et al. (2005). However, it can be tested further on the subset of SNLS data having at least three usable photometric bands. The test proceeds as follows: 1. We ﬁt the three bands at once, and store the stretch and date of maximum B light. 2. We ﬁt the two reddest bands (BV for nearby objects), with the stretch, and date of maximum being ﬁxed at the previ- ously obtained values. From the ﬁtted light-curve model we extract the expected rest-frame U band magnitude at maxi- mum B light, UBV . 3. We ﬁt the two bluest bands, (U B for nearby objects), still with the stretch and date of maximum ﬁxed. From this ﬁt, we extract the expected rest-frame U band magnitude at maximum B light. Since it matches the measurement when the actual U ﬂux is measured, we call it Umeas. The test quantity is ∆U3 ≡ UBV − Umeas, i.e. the “predicted” U (derived from B and V) minus the measured U brightness. Forcing both quantities to be measured with the same stretch and B maximum date is not essential, but narrows the distribu- tion of residuals. A residual of zero means that the three mea- sured bands agree with the light-curve model for a certain pa- rameter set, and hence that the distance estimate will be identi- cal for the two diﬀerent color ﬁts. There are 10 SNLS “intermediate” redshift events at 0.25 < z < 0.4, where gMrMiM sample the U BV rest-frame region, and 17 “distant” events at 0.55 < z < 0.8, where U BV shifts to the rMiMzM triplet. We also have at our disposal a sample of 28 “nearby” objects measured in U BV, both from the nearby sam- ple described in Table 8, and also from the light-curve model training sample which consists mainly of very nearby objects (see Guy et al. 2005). Figure 11 displays the value of ∆U3 as a function of redshift and Table 4 summarizes the averages and dispersions. A very small scatter (about 0.033) is found for the intermediate redshift sample. The nearby and distant samples exhibit larger scatters; the nearby sample is probably aﬀected by the practical diﬃculties in calibrating U observations, and our distant sample is aﬀected by the poor S/N in the zM band. We conclude from this study that our light curves model ac- curately describes the relations between the supernovae colors. Note that this ∆U3 indicator is a promising tool for photometric classiﬁcation of SNe Ia, provided its scatter remains compara- ble to that found for the intermediate redshift sample. Sample 14 P.

The error bars reﬂect photometric uncertain- ties. The redshift regions have been chosen so that the mea- sured bands roughly sample the U BV rest-frame region. The diﬀerences between average values for the three samples agree within statistical uncertainties, indicating that the relation be- tween U, B and V brightnesses does not change with redshift. Although the nearby and intermediate samples have compara- ble photometric resolution, the intermediate sample exhibits a far smaller scatter. We attribute this diﬀerence to the practical diﬃculties in calibrating U band observations. 7. Systematic uncertainties We present, in this Section, estimates of the systematic un- certainties possibly aﬀecting our cosmological parameter mea- surements. 7.1. Photometric calibration and ﬁlter band-passes We simulated a zero-point shift by varying the magnitudes of the light-curve points, one band at a time. Table 5 gives the re- sulting shifts in the derived cosmological parameters from the calibration errors derived in Section 4.1. We assume that errors in the gMrMiMzM zero-points are independent, and propagate these 4 errors quadratically to obtain the total eﬀect on cosmol- ogy. Band P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set 15 derived using B- and V-band data. Note also that the quan- tity ∆U3 appears to be independent of redshift, implying that if the average luminosity of SNe Ia evolves with redshift, this evolution must preserve the U BV rest-frame color relations. Lentz et al. (2000) predict a strong dependence of the UV ﬂux from the progenitor metallicity (at ﬁxed B − V color), which should have been visible if metallicity evolution were indeed present. 7.4. Malmquist bias The Malmquist bias may aﬀect the cosmological conclusions by altering the average brightness of measured SNe in a red- shift dependent way. The mechanism is however not exactly straightforward since the reconstructed distance depends on stretch and color, and not only on the brightness. We have conducted simulations, both of nearby SN searches and of the SNLS survey, to investigate the eﬀects on the derivation of cos- mological parameters. We simulated light-curves of nearby SNe Ia (0.02 < z < 0.1) with random explosion date, stretch and color, using the observed brighter-slower and brighter-bluer correlations. We then simulated a brightness cut at a ﬁxed date. Although the number of “detected” events and their average redshift strongly depends on the brightness cut, the average distance bias of the survivors is found to change by less than 10%, when varying both the value and the sharpness of the brightness cut. The bias is also essentially independent of the discovery phase, although the peak brightness is not. We ﬁnd a distance modulus bias of 0.027 (similar in B, V and R), sensitive at the 10% level to the unknown details of nearby searches. Note that the redshift de- pendence of the distance bias of the nearby sample has no im- pact on the cosmological measurements: only the average bias matters. The crude simulation we conducted applies only to ﬂux limited searches, which applies to about half of the sample. We compute an average bias value for our nearby sample as the simulation result (0.027 mag) times the fraction of events to which it applies. Assuming that both factors suﬀer from an un- certainty of 50%, we ﬁnd an average nearby sample bias value of 0.017 ± 0.012 mag. A global increase of all nearby distances by 0.017(±0.012) mag increases ΩM (ﬂat universe) by 0.019 (±0.013). For the distant SNLS sample, which is ﬂux limited, we sim- ulated supernovae at a rate per co-moving volume independent of redshift, accounted for the brighter-slower and brighter-bluer correlations, and adjusted the position and smoothness of the limiting magnitude cut in order to reproduce the redshift and peak magnitude distributions. In contrast with nearby SN sim- ulations, here we have many observed distributions for a sin- gle search, and the key parameters that enter the simulation are highly constrained. The best match to SNLS data is shown in Figure 12, and Figure 13 shows the expected biases as a function of redshift in the shape and color parameters, and for our distance estimator. The distance modulus bias is about 0.02 mag at z = 0.8, increasing to 0.05 at z = 1. Correcting for the computed bias decreases ΩM (ﬂat Universe) by 0.02.

To summarize: we ﬁnd that the diﬀerential bias between nearby and distant samples almost exactly cancels, and esti- mate an overall uncertainty of 0.016 in ΩM (ﬂat Universe). Since applying the Malmquist bias corrections changes the cos- mological results by less than 0.1 σ, the corrections have not been applied. However, in the future, when the SNLS sample size increases, modeling and applying the Malmquist bias cor- rection will assume a greater importance. The same applies to the nearby sample, where having a more controlled and ho- mogeneous sample, discovered by a single search (e.g. SN Factory, Aldering et al. 2002) will be essential to reduce the associated systematic uncertainty. 7.5. SNe Ib/c interlopers All supernovae used here were spectroscopically identiﬁed as SN Ia, but we have labeled the least secure identiﬁcations as SN Ia* (Section 2.2, Howell et al. 2005). These 15 events are prob- able SN Ia but for this class a small amount of contamination by SNe Ib or SNe Ic (SNe Ib/c) is possible. We have checked that cosmological ﬁts done with or without these events lead to the same cosmological conclusions (Section 5.4). We also looked at estimating the SN Ib/c contamination in our sample. SNe Ib/c have an intrinsic luminosity distribution which is wider than SNe Ia (cf. dispersion 0.45 mag for SNe Ia, vs. 1.2 mag for SNe Ib/c; Homeier 2005; Richardson et al. 2002). After correcting for the SNe Ia brighter-slower and brighter-bluer correlations, a conservative estimate is that the SNe Ib/c scatter around the SNe Ia Hubble line with a disper- sion 3 to 4 times larger than for SNe Ia. The ﬁrst clue of SN Ib/c contamination would be the presence of objects with large residuals around the Hubble line; these contaminants should on average be fainter than SNe Ia at the same redshift. We have rejected two objects from the Hubble diagram (Section 5.4). Even if we consider both of these events to be SN Ib/c events, 16 P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set and assume that the dispersion of the SN Ia distribution about the Hubble line is 4 times smaller than for SNe Ib/c, we expect on average only 0.5 Ib/c interloper within the ﬁtted sample. For these reasons, we estimate the potential bias arising from the presence of non Ia events in our sample to be neg- ligible. 7.6. Gravitational lensing and grey dust Gravitational lensing by mass inhomogeneities may aﬀect the apparent brightness of our supernovae. With respect to a uni- form matter density, most of the events experience a tiny de- ampliﬁcation, and a small minority are ampliﬁed (see e.g. Holz & Wald 1998). Whereas the average ﬂux is conserved in the case of weak lensing, part of the SN light is lost when strong lensing pro- duces multiple images among which some escape detection. Multiple images of distant radio sources have been systemat- ically searched by the CLASS survey (Myers et al. 2003) and have proved to be rare: the occurrence of multiple images sep- arated by more than 0.3′′ and with ﬂux ratio below 10:1 was found to be of 1 out of 690 with 1.44 secondary image on aver- age, with ineﬃciencies due to the separation and ﬂux ratio cuts of 13% and 37% respectively (Browne et al. 2003). Multiple images with a smaller separation are not resolved in the SNLS, and their time delay is much smaller than the typical duration of a SN light curve2 so that no ﬂux is lost for such events. Hence CLASS results provide us with an upper limit for the number of (resolved) strong lensing cases in the SNLS super- nova sample, given the fact that CLASS sources are globally more distant (see Chae 2003). Assuming (pessimistically) that for each strongly lensed SN, we see only one image, the ﬂux bias is smaller than 0.3% at z = 1. Gravitational lensing also broadens asymmetri- cally the brightness distribution of SNe at large red- shifts (Bergstr¨om et al. 2000). As a consequence, a cos- mological ﬁt using SNe magnitudes (instead of ﬂuxes) is biased. Holz & Linder (2004) found a dispersion of 0.088 × z (note that Bergstr¨om et al. 2000 ﬁnd a value of ∼0.04 at z = 1 for smooth halo proﬁles in ﬂat ΛCDM), which translates into a bias of the average magnitude of ∼ 0.004 × z. The broadening of the brightness distribution also aﬀects the cosmological parameters uncertainties. In the cosmological ﬁt, we have derived a constant “intrinsic” dispersion which includes the average dispersion due to lensing. Neglecting its redshift dependence has no signiﬁcant impact on the accuracy of the errors derived for the cosmological parameters. In summary, the total eﬀect of lensing on cosmological pa- rameters is very small. We ﬁnd that ΩM for a ﬂat ΛCDM cos- mology and the equation of state for a ﬂat universe with BAO constraints, are shifted by at most −0.005 and −0.01 respec- tively. We therefore did not apply any correction to our results. The possibility that SNe Ia could be dimmed by intergalac- tic grey dust (i.e. with weak extinction variation over the optical P. Astier et al, SNLS Collaboration: SNLS 1st Year Data Set 17 for a ﬂat cosmology with constant equation of state, when our constraints are combined with the BAO SDSS results. Assuming w > −1 brings our upper limit to −0.83 (at 95% CL). Supernovae alone give a marginal constraint: w < −0.5 at 95% CL. These results agree well with previous works, both from SNe Ia, and also from other sources. For example Seljak et al. (2005) ﬁnds very similar results combining CMB, LSS and Lyα constraints. The dominant systematic errors arise from the nearby sample and from the photometric calibration of the zM band; both will be improved in the future. The multi-band light- curves allow us to study color relations as a function of redshift; these data are expected to be sensitive indicators of evolution. We observed a surprisingly narrow correlation between (U-B) and (B-V) (using the ∆U3 indicator), indicating that the disper- sion in U-band properties is well correlated with measurements in redder bands. From the ﬁrst year of SNLS data, we placed 71 distant events on the Hubble Diagram, with 10 more from the same period to be added later. (Our full ﬁrst year statistics would have been around 100 SNe Ia with spectroscopic conﬁrmation had we not lost Feb 2004 to an instrument failure.) Our time sampling, ﬁlter coverage, and image quality have now signiﬁcantly improved since early 2004, and we now regularly acquire 2–3 times as much data in zM. A precise photometric calibration is essential, and we are now working with the CFHTLS community in reﬁning the photometric calibration of the MegaCam instrument. We have embarked on the process of calibrating tertiary standards in our ﬁelds, from Sloan secondary and primary standards. This will allow us to cross-check the Vega/Landolt zero-points, and more accurately calibrate zM band observations. After only two years of operation, the SNLS has already demonstrated its advantages over all previous ground-based supernova surveys. The ”rolling search” technique is robust to weather and instrument-related problems, and the technical characteristics of the survey are now well understood. The av- erage rate of spectroscopically-conﬁrmed SNe Ia is currently about 10 per lunation and continues to increase. Up until July 2005, the SNLS sample includes more than 200 spectroscopi- cally identiﬁed SNe Ia, most with excellent photometric tem- poral and ﬁlter coverage. An extrapolation of the current rate to the end of the survey indicates that we should reach our goal of building a Hubble diagram with about 700 spectroscopically identiﬁed well-measured SN Ia events. The SNLS already has the largest-ever sample of high-z SNe discovered by a single telescope, and will eventually produce a homogeneous, high- quality sample that is an order of magnitude larger still. High statistical accuracy beneﬁts the control of systematics. With our unmatched SN statistics, by year 5 we will be able to populate each ∼ 0.1 redshift bin with ∼ 100 SNe Ia, thus ﬁlling the brightness, decline-rate, and color 3-dimensional parameter space. This will enable us to detect possible drifts in “SNe Ia demographics”, and control Malmquist bias. Moreover, the rolling-search observing mode produces many events at low to intermediate redshift with superb photometric accuracy, be- cause integration times are tailored for the faintest objects. These relatively bright events permit demanding internal con- sistency tests, and may lead to improvements in distance esti- mation. Acknowledgements.
