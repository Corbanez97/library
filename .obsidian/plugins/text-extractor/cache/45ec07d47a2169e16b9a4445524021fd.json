Received YYY; in original form ZZZ ABSTRACT We present 637 low-redshift optical spectra collected by the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP) between 2009 and 2018, almost entirely with the Kast double spec- trograph on the Shane 3 m telescope at Lick Observatory. We describe our automated spectral classiﬁcation scheme and arrive at a ﬁnal set of 626 spectra (of 242 objects) that are unambiguously classiﬁed as belonging to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Of these, 70 spectra of 30 objects are classiﬁed as spectroscopically peculiar (i.e., not matching the spectral signatures of “normal” SNe Ia) and 79 SNe Ia (covered by 328 spectra) have complementary photometric coverage. The median SN in our ﬁnal set has one epoch of spectroscopy, has a redshift of 0.0208 (with a low of 0.0007 and high of 0.1921), and is ﬁrst observed spectroscopically 1.1 days after maximum light. The con- stituent spectra are of high quality, with a median signal-to-noise ratio of 31.8 pixel−1, and have broad wavelength coverage, with ∼ 95% covering at least 3700–9800 ˚A. We analyze our dataset, focusing on quantitative measurements (e.g., velocities, pseudo- equivalent widths) of the evolution of prominent spectral features in the available early-time and late-time spectra. The data are available to the community, and we encourage future studies to incorporate our spectra in their analyses.

E. Stahl et al. ing from stellar to cosmological. The class of objects known as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which result from the ther- monuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in bi- nary systems (e.g., Hoyle & Fowler 1960; Colgate & McKee 1969; Nomoto et al. 1984), have been of particular interest to astrophysicists for many years. Despite intensive study, many important details of SNe Ia remain poorly understood, if at all (for a review, see Howell 2011). How do diﬀerences in initial conditions lead to the variation in properties observed among SNe Ia? What are the physical details of the explosion mechanism(s)? Are the progenitor systems “single-degenerate” (Whelan & Iben 1973) or “double-degenerate” (Webbink 1984; Iben & Tu- tukov 1984), and how do they contribute to the observed variance in SN Ia attributes? To answer these and other questions, numerous observations of SNe Ia will undoubt- edly be required — preferably obtained and reduced in a thorough and consistent manner. Despite these outstanding questions regarding SNe Ia as astrophysical objects, they are highly prized for their large and relatively homogeneous optical spectra and luminosities at peak brightness, though some diﬀerences do exist (e.g., Filippenko 1997, and references therein). To the extent that their peak luminosities are “standardisable,” SNe Ia are ex- cellent cosmological distance indicators. Accordingly, much eﬀort has been expended in developing methods to better calibrate relationships between various observables and peak luminosity. The “Phillips relation” identiﬁes a correlation be- tween luminosity at peak brightness and light-curve decline rate for most SNe Ia (Phillips 1993). By making use of op- tical colours, Riess et al. (1996) have devised a method that yields further improvements, including the determination of the extinction caused by dust in the host galaxy of a SN Ia. Distance measurements derived using such methods led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999), which revolu- tionised the ﬁeld of cosmology. Indeed, the nature of the dark energy that gives rise to the acceleration is currently one of the most important questions in physics. SNe Ia have since been used to place increasingly strin- gent constraints on cosmological parameters (Astier et al. 2006; Riess et al. 2007; Hicken et al. 2009; Suzuki et al. 2012; Betoule et al. 2014; Jones et al. 2018; Scolnic et al. 2018) and continue to provide precise measurements of the Hub- ble constant (Riess et al. 2016, 2019; Dhawan et al. 2018). As spectra must contain more information than light curves, many have searched for and identiﬁed spectroscopic param- eters to make SN Ia distance measurements more precise (Bailey et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009; Blondin et al. 2011; Silverman et al. 2012c; Fakhouri et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2018). In addition, Foley & Kasen (2011) found that the in- trinsic colour of SNe Ia at peak brightness depends on the velocity of their ejecta, and Wang et al. (2013) have shown that the latter has a signiﬁcant connection to SN Ia birth- place environments — and hence progenitor stars. It is likely that future increases in distance measurement precision will make use of spectroscopic parameters, motivating the need for extensive, consistent samples of SN Ia spectra. The Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP) is a large- scale eﬀort to study the properties of SNe Ia at low red- shift (z ≲ 0.05), primarily via optical spectroscopy (Silver- man et al. 2012a, henceforth S12a) and photometry (Gane- shalingam et al. 2010; Stahl et al. 2019, henceforth G10 and S19, respectively). The spectra presented in this data-release paper are complementary to those published by S12a, and extend the BSNIP SN Ia spectral dataset to cover the period from 1989 through 2018. Our strategy is generally to observe as many SNe Ia as possible, with particular eﬀort invested in obtaining frequent spectral coverage of peculiar objects. Fur- thermore, we strive for spectral coverage of all objects that our group is also observing photometrically (consequently, there is considerable overlap in SNe Ia between the spectra presented herein and the photometric dataset released by S19), and we aim to provide prompt spectroscopic classiﬁ- cations of all SNe discovered by the 0.76-m Katzman Auto- matic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory (KAIT; Fil- ippenko et al. 2001). Our spectra are obtained and reduced in a controlled and consistent manner, thereby eliminating many of the systematic diﬀerences that manifest when dis- tinct datasets are collected into one sample. In this data release, we present and characterise 637 op- tical spectra of 247 distinct objects collected by the BSNIP between the beginning of 2009 and the end of 2018. The spectra were obtained with the Shane 3 m telescope at Lick Observatory and the Keck-I 10 m telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Of the full set of spectra, 546 are pub- lished here for the ﬁrst time. When we combine our spectral dataset with that presented by S12a, we obtain a sample of nearly 2000 spectra of low-redshift SNe Ia, all of which have been observed and reduced in a consistent manner. We organise the remainder of this paper as follows. Section 2 de- scribes the organisation, observation, and reduction strate- gies employed in assembling our dataset. In Section 3 we detail our spectral classiﬁcation scheme, and we study its re- sults and derive ﬁnal object classiﬁcations. We present our ﬁnal spectroscopic dataset and explore its early-time and late-time evolution in Section 4, and we conclude with Sec- tion 5. 2 DATA 2.1 Data Management and Selection All BSNIP spectroscopy, along with useful metadata for those observations and the SNe in them (e.g., observer, reducer, host galaxy, redshift, etc.), are catalogued in our UC Berkeley SuperNova DataBase1 (SNDB; S12a, Shiv- vers et al. 2016) after the data are processed and reduced (see Section 2.3 for a summary of our data-processing tech- niques). Therefore, to collect the dataset presented herein we simply query the private (prepublication) portion of our SNDB for all spectra observed between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2018 for objects spectroscopically classiﬁed2 as SNe Ia. This results in 744 matches, which we then ﬁlter by (i) selecting only those spectra with an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 5 pixel−1 (yielding 714 matches above this quality threshold) and (ii) retaining only those 1 http://heracles.astro.berkeley.edu/sndb/ 2 We source spectroscopic classiﬁcations primarily from the Cen- tral Bureau of Electronic Telegrams (CBETs) and the Interna- tional Astronomical Union Circulars (IAUCs).

Finally, we remove several of the remaining spectra, including any that are from SNe discovered ear- lier than 1 January 2008 (to avoid presenting only late-time spectra of an object at the early end of our selection range), to obtain the aforementioned set of 637 spectra. Following publication, all previously unpublished spectra will be trans- ferred to the publicly accessible portion of the SNDB. We list basic SN-level information in Table A1 and spectrum-level information in Table 1, with many of the properties sourced from the Transient Name Server (TNS)3 or the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)4. Representative SN Ia spec- tra from our sample showing low, medium, and high SNRs are given in Figure 1. The SNR of the central spectrum in the ﬁgure is similar to the mean SNR for our entire sample (as discussed in Section 4.1), and is thus indicative of the high quality of the spectra presented herein. 3 https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il 4 The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Tech- nology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 2.2 Observations The vast majority of the spectra in our dataset (579/637) were obtained using the Kast double spectrograph (Miller & Stone 1993) mounted on the Shane 3 m telescope at the Lick Observatory. The remaining observations (58/637) were made with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke et al. 1995) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The see- ing at these locations averages ∼ 2′′ and ∼ 1′′, respectively. Most spectra presented here were obtained with the long slit at or near the parallactic angle so as to reduce the diﬀeren- tial light loss caused by atmospheric dispersion (Filippenko 1982); however, this was not necessary with LRIS, as it is equipped with an atmospheric dispersion corrector. The spe- ciﬁc details of our observing strategy are thoroughly docu- mented by S12a, so here we mention only relevant changes to the aforementioned instruments. On 18 September 2016, the Kast red-side CCD was re- placed with a Hamamatsu 1024 × 4096 pixel device with 15 µm pixels, yielding a spatial scale of 0′′. 43 pixel−1. Com- pared to the previous red-side CCD, the new detector fea- tures signiﬁcantly reduced readout noise and better quan- tum eﬃciency for wavelengths greater than 5000 ˚A. Most (483/579) Kast spectra presented herein were taken prior to this upgrade. In May and June of 2009, the LRIS red-channel CCD was replaced with a mosaic of two 2k × 4k pixel Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) CCDs with a spatial scale of 0′′. 135 pixel−1. The mosaic features smaller pixels and higher quantum eﬃciency in the red than the original CCD (Rock- osi et al. 2010). Nearly all (52/58 since 1 July 2009) LRIS spectra were taken using this upgraded conﬁguration. 2.3 Data Reduction An important attribute of our sample is the consistency with which the data have been reduced. Regardless of instrument, the same general procedures are followed for all spectral re- ductions, and just ﬁve individuals are responsible for reduc- ing the majority (> 88%) of our dataset. In the following paragraph, we brieﬂy summarise the principal steps in our reduction strategy (see S12a for a more comprehensive dis- cussion), which are implemented using IRAF5 routines and publicly available Python and IDL programs6. First, standard preparation steps including bias re- moval, cosmic ray rejection, and ﬂat-ﬁeld correction are per- formed. Following extraction, one-dimensional spectra are wavelength-calibrated using comparison-lamp spectra typi- cally taken in the afternoon prior to each observing run. The spectra are then ﬂux-calibrated using spectra (taken during each observing run with the appropriate instrumental setup) of bright spectrophotometric standard stars at similar air- masses. Finally, atmospheric (telluric) absorption features 5 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Ob- servatory, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). 6 Kast and LRIS data are currently reduced with KastShiv (Shiv- vers et al. 2016) and LPipe (Perley 2019), respectively. Prior to October 2016, a number of LRIS spectra were reduced with purpose-built routines from the Carnegie Python (CarPy) Distri- bution (Kelson et al. 2000; Kelson 2003). MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) 4 B.

(2019, in prep.). are removed and overlapping (i.e., red- and blue-side spec- tra from Kast or LRIS) are combined by scaling one so that it matches the other7 over the common wavelength range. We consider spectra at this stage to be “science ready.” 3 CLASSIFICATION Optical spectra are widely used to classify SNe as belong- ing to one of several distinct types, and possibly subtypes (e.g., Filippenko 1997). We perform such classiﬁcation in an automated fashion using the SuperNova IDentiﬁcation code (SNID, Blondin & Tonry 2007) with tightly controlled toler- ances. SNID classiﬁes SNe by cross-correlating an input spec- trum against a large library of template spectra (Tonry & Davis 1979). In the following sections we detail our spectral classiﬁcation procedure, present results, and discuss veriﬁ- cations of these results. 3.1 SNID Classiﬁcation Procedure Using a classiﬁcation scheme similar to that employed by S12a, we attempt to determine the type, subtype, redshift, and age from each spectrum in our sample via consecutive SNID runs that adhere to the speciﬁcations outlined in the following sections. 3.1.1 SNID Type We ﬁrst attempt to determine the type of a SN from its spec- trum by executing a SNID run and requiring an r lap8 value 7 For Kast spectra, the blue side is scaled to match the red side, while for LRIS spectra, whichever side shows the lower transmis- sion level is scaled upward. 8 The r lap is a measure of quality used by SNID — higher values correspond to classiﬁcations that are more trustworthy. of at least 10. If the host-galaxy redshift of the SN is listed in Table A1, then we force SNID to use this redshift by invoking the forcez keyword — otherwise SNID will attempt to ﬁnd the redshift simultaneously. In order for type determination to be considered successful, we require that the fraction of “good”9 correlations corresponding to the proposed type be > 50% and that the best-matching “good” template be of the same type. If no type is determined by this approach, we relax the minimum r lap value to 5 and repeat the pro- cedure. If a type is determined at this stage, we proceed to subtype determination. 3.1.2 SNID Subtype In the subtype-determination run, we again force SNID to use the redshift of the SN if it is available (and ﬁnd it simultane- ously otherwise). We also force SNID to use only templates that match the previously found type. Again, we attempt a SNID run with a minimum r lap value of 10, and relax this to 5 if the ﬁrst run is unsuccessful. In the case of subtype determination, success is achieved if the fraction of “good” correlations corresponding to a subtype is > 50% and the best-matching “good” template is of the same subtype. 3.1.3 SNID Redshift We use SNID to determine the redshift from a spectrum by executing a SNID run that requires all templates to be of the subtype found previously (or type, if the subtype was not successfully determined). We use no external redshift information, even if it appears in Table A1, but we do restrict 9 In SNID, a template is graded “good” when its strongest cor- relation with the input spectrum occurs at a redshift that diﬀers by less than 0.02 from the forced (or simultaneously ﬁt) redshift of the input spectrum. MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) BSNIP Spectroscopy of 247 SNe Ia 5 the range of template redshifts to lie within 0 < z < 0.3. We calculate the redshift as the median of all “good” template redshift values, and the redshift uncertainty is taken to be the standard deviation of these values. If the redshift and subtype are determined, then we attempt to ﬁnd the rest- frame phase relative to maximum light (henceforth referred to as “age”) from the spectrum. 3.1.4 SNID Age We attempt to determine the age of a SN spectrum by ex- ecuting a SNID run that uses only templates of the subtype determined previously and that requires SNID to use the known redshift, or the redshift determined previously if it was not known. The age (henceforth, tSNID) is calculated as the median of only the “good” template ages that have an r lap value of at least 75% of the largest achieved r lap value. The age uncertainty is the standard deviation of these ages. Furthermore, we require that the age uncertainty be less than the larger of 4 days or 20% of the determined age. 3.2 Classiﬁcation Results and Veriﬁcations Of the 637 spectra selected for characterisation, our SNID routine successfully determines the type in 608 instances, the subtype in 506, the redshift in 605, and the age in 406. We present the results derived from performing our SNID classiﬁcation procedure in Table 2, and we discuss and ex- amine them in the following subsections. 3.2.1 Types and Subtypes To study the robustness of our SNID-determined types and subtypes, we look for distinctions we can draw between spec- tra that were successfully classiﬁed versus those that were not. In particular, we investigate whether there is a signif- icant diﬀerence between success and failure that is codiﬁed by (i) the average SNR of a spectrum, or (ii) the phase in a SN’s temporal evolution during which that spectrum was observed. The median SNR of the spectra for which SNID suc- cessfully determines a type (subtype) is 32.7 pixel−1 (33.4 pixel−1), while for those where it failed the median is 14.3 pixel−1 (26.4 pixel−1). For the case of determining the type, this presents a compelling argument — spectra for which the type is classiﬁed are generally of higher quality (as as- sessed by the SNR) than those that are not. Although the gap in median SNR between the successful and failed subsets is notably less pronounced for the case of determining the subtype, we must make a concession for the fact (as stated in Section 3.1.1) that the entire population, for which an attempt is made to determine subtype, is drawn only from those where the type has been successfully determined (and hence whose aggregate SNR is higher, as discussed above). With this important caveat noted, it would appear that the gap in SNR between successful and failed subtype classi- ﬁcations is indeed meaningful — those SNe for which the subtype is not successfully determined have a median SNR that is ∼ 9 times below that of the entire population, rela- tive to the median SNR for those for which the subtype is determined. Next, we examine how the diﬀerence in rest-frame days between when a spectrum was observed and when the SN in that spectrum reached maximum brightness as determined from its light curve (i.e., the phase) may inﬂuence SNID’s success rate with regard to (sub)type classiﬁcation. We ﬁnd that the median phase in cases where SNID successfully iden- tiﬁes a type (subtype) is 19.4 days (16.5 days), while in cases where it fails the median is 65.3 days (40.7 days). Owing to the much sparser coverage of SNID spectral templates at late phases (see, e.g., Figure 6 of S12a), it makes sense for the failure rate to be larger for spectra at late phases. In addi- tion, spectra at earlier phases tend to have higher SNRs than do those at later phases10 because SNe Ia fade throughout their post-maximum evolution. As we have seen above, the SNR of a spectrum plays a substantive role the outcome of (sub)type classiﬁcation. We ﬁnd it reasonable, then, that the median phase is earlier for successes than it is for failures. Furthermore, while the caveat from the preceding paragraph regarding the population for which subtype-determination is attempted is still relevant, it is similarly overcome — the diﬀerence between the median phase of those for which the subtype is not successfully determined (40.7 days) and that of the entire population (19.4 days) is ∼ 7 times larger than the associated diﬀerence for those whose subtype is deter- mined (16.5 days). 3.2.2 Redshifts We investigate our SNID-determined redshifts by comparing them to the corresponding host-galaxy redshifts, when they are available, as shown in Figure 2. From the 563 spectra in our sample for which (i) SNID determined a redshift, (ii) SNID determined the spectrum was of a SN Ia (independent of the subtype classiﬁcation), and (iii) a redshift is listed in Table A1, we ﬁnd a median residual of 0.0002 with a standard deviation of 0.0039. Furthermore, we calculate the normalised median absolute deviation (Ilbert et al. 2006), deﬁned as σ ≡ 1.48 × median [ |zSNID − zgal| 1 + zgal ] , (1) and ﬁnd a value 0.003, similar to S12a who found 0.002 for their dataset. Of the spectra used for comparison, 446 have a redshift residual within one standard deviation of the median, 522 are within two standard deviations, and 553 are within three. 3.2.3 Phases Next we compare SNID-determined phases to those calcu- lated (in rest-frame days) relative to light-curve-determined times of maxima (henceforth, tLC), when available (see Ta- ble 1 for tLC values and Table A1 for references on the times of maximum brightness used to compute them). We perform this comparison for all spectra with the requisite informa- tion which SNID classiﬁed as belonging to a SN Ia (for a total of 219 spectra), and the result is shown in Figure 3.

This is not unexpected given the dearth of template spectra available at late phases (as discussed in Section 3.2.1) and is consistent with the results of previous studies (e.g., Figure 7 of S12a). If we further restrict the subset used for phase compar- ison to cover only the earlier, more rapidly evolving stages of spectroscopic evolution [namely, only those for which the (rest-frame) light-curve-determined phase is < 50 days and the SNID-determined phase is < 30 days], we are left with 0 150 300tSNID (days) 0 100 200 300 tLC (days) 100 0tSNIDtLC 12 0 12 24 8 0 8 Figure 3.

The median residual for this subset is ∼ 0.4 days with a standard deviation of ∼ 3.9 days. Of this subset, 95 spectra have a residual that lies within 1σ of the median, 116 are within 2σ, and 125 are within 3σ. We ﬁnd that for very early phases (tLC ≲ −10 days), SNID-determined phases tend to be an overestimate (as can be seen in the inset panel of Figure 3). As with SNID’s tendency to underestimate the phase of late-time spectra, the dominant cause of the noted early-phase overestimate can be attributed to the paucity of template spectra at similar phases. MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) BSNIP Spectroscopy of 247 SNe Ia 7 3.3 Object Classiﬁcations Many of the SNe in our sample have multiple spectra, and therefore we must combine the classiﬁcation information de- rived for each spectrum to obtain a ﬁnal classiﬁcation for each object. To determine the type of an object with mul- tiple spectra, we choose the most frequently occurring type in that object’s spectral classiﬁcations. In cases with a tie between two possible type characterisations, we use the type of the spectrum whose best-matching SNID template has the larger r lap value. To account for the uncertainty surround- ing such classiﬁcations, we add a “*” to the type. We follow a similar procedure for determining the subtype of each ob- ject, except that in cases where there is a tie for the most frequent subtype, we do not classify the subtype. The ﬁnal (sub)type derived from this methodology is listed for each SN in our sample in Table A1. Altogether, 242 objects are unambiguously classiﬁed as SNe Ia and one is given the clas- siﬁcation of “Ia*”. The remaining four objects are discussed in the following section. 3.4 Objects Not Classiﬁed as SNe Ia There are four objects (SN 2009eq, LSQ 12fhe, SN 2013gh, and SN 2013fw) in our dataset for which the aforementioned classiﬁcation method either fails to classify the object at all, or classiﬁes it as something other than a SN Ia. We examine and brieﬂy discuss each of these objects below. 3.4.1 SN 2009eq Of the three spectra of SN 2009eq included in our dataset, two (taken 3 d and 20 d after our ﬁrst spectrum) are clas- siﬁed as belonging to a SN Ic, and the remaining one (our ﬁrst observation of the object) is not successfully classiﬁed at all. After visual inspection of the three spectra by multiple coauthors, we override the SNID-determined type in favour of “Ia*” — the spectra appear to be consistent with that of a SN Ia, and particularly a SN 1991bg-like (Filippenko et al. 1992a; Leibundgut et al. 1993) object evolving within one month of maximum brightness. However, given that our SNID-based classiﬁcation scheme does not come to the same conclusion, we cannot unambiguously give a “Ia” classiﬁca- tion from our dataset alone. It is also worth noting that our determination that SN 2009eq is a SN 1991bg-like object is consistent with its initial classiﬁcation (Foley et al. 2009). 3.4.2 LSQ 12fhe Our classiﬁcation scheme deems the single spectrum of LSQ 12fhe in our dataset to be of a SN Ic, contradicting the object’s initial classiﬁcation as a SN Ia of the SN 1991T-like (Filippenko et al. 1992b; Phillips et al. 1992) subtype (Had- jiyska et al. 2012). Looking more closely at our SNID classiﬁ- cation, we see that the SN Ic classiﬁcation was favoured by just one more template than for a SN Ia. After visual inspec- tion by multiple coauthors, we reach a consensus that the object is deﬁnitely a SN Ia, and most likely of the SN 1991T- like subtype (consistent with the initial classiﬁcation). Ac- cordingly, we override our SNID-determined type to be “Ia*” — this reﬂects its true classiﬁcation but accounts for the fact that our classiﬁcation scheme does not reach the cor- rect conclusion. 3.4.3 SN 2013gh SN 2013gh is covered by three spectra in our dataset (with light-curve-determined phases of −12, 70, and 392 days). The ﬁrst spectrum is unambiguously determined to be of a SN Ia (with an undetermined age), while the second is assigned as a SN Ic (with an age of 1.5 days), and the third is undeter- mined (not surprising given SNID’s lack of late-phase tem- plates, as previously discussed). In light of (i) the visually obvious SN Ia determination from the ﬁrst spectrum, (ii) the completely incorrect SNID-determined phase of the sec- ond spectrum, and (iii) the multiple-coauthor consensus that the second spectrum is consistent with that of a SN Ia at the appropriate phase, we again override our SNID-determined type in favour of “Ia*”. 3.4.4 SN 2013fw The single spectrum of SN 2013fw in our dataset is at a very late phase (> 300 days), and thus it is unsurprising, given SNID’s lack of suitable templates (as discussed in Sec- tion 3.2.1), that our classiﬁcation scheme does not succeed. We thus defer to the existing object classiﬁcation (Jin et al. 2013), and assign its type as “Ia*” — it is a SN Ia but we cannot conclusively conﬁrm or refute the classiﬁcation using our dataset alone. 4 RESULTS In this section we present and study our low-redshift SN Ia spectral dataset derived from observations totaling more than 275 hr of telescope time. Of our initial selection (from Section 2.1), 242 objects (covered by a total of 626 spectra) are unambiguously classiﬁed as SNe Ia by the methodology described in the preceding section. In the discussion that fol- lows, we consider only this selection of spectra. We provide plots and ﬁle access for all spectra described in this work electronically via our SNDB. 4.1 Sample Characteristics Our dataset averages 2.6 spectra per SN Ia (with a me- dian of 1), similar to the ∼ 2.2 spectra per object S12a found for their dataset and reﬂective of BSNIP’s emphasis on maximising the number of objects studied spectroscopically rather than the number of spectra per object. SN 2016coj has the most spectra of any object in our sample with 20, followed by SN 2011fe with 17. Figure 4 shows the full distri- bution of the number of spectra per SN Ia. Of the 242 SNe Ia in our sample, 109 are covered by at least two spectra. For the 79 SNe in our sample that have a light-curve-determined time of maximum brightness (as noted in Table A1), we ﬁnd a median (rest-frame) phase of the ﬁrst spectrum of 1.1 days, as shown in the centre panel of Figure 4. Of this subsample with phase information, 38 SNe have a spectrum observed before the time of maximum brightness and 69 have one within 20 days of maximum. We show the redshift distri- bution of the objects in our sample in the right panel of MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) 8 B. E. Stahl et al. Figure 4. Aside from two SNe with redshifts of near (but below) 0.2, all have z < 0.1 and 201 (of the 221 with a red- shift listed in Table A1) have z ≤ 0.05. We ﬁnd a median redshift of 0.0208 for the full sample, and for the 184 SNe with z ≥ 0.01 (i.e., within the Hubble ﬂow) we ﬁnd a median of 0.0230. We show the distribution of average SNRs for the spec- tra in our dataset in the left panel of Figure 5. The median is 31.8 pixel−1 (with a mean of 38.3 pixel−1), and 574/626 spectra have SNR > 10 pixel−1. By design (see Section 2.1), we ﬁnd a minimum SNR of ∼ 5 pixel−1. As shown in the centre panel of Figure 5, we ﬁnd the median (light-curve- determined rest-frame) phase for the spectra with such infor- mation to be 19.4 days. The spectrum with the earliest phase belongs to SN 2011fe at −17.2 days, followed by two spec- tra of SN 2012cg with phases of −16.4 days and −15.4 days. The spectrum with the latest phase belongs to SN 2013dy at 422 days, followed by one from SN 2011fe at 379 days. Our dataset includes 15 spectra at phases of at least 160 days. We ﬁnd that 168 of the 328 spectra in our sample which have light-curve-determined phases correspond to earlier than 20 days in the post-maximum evolution of their SN. The distri- butions of the wavelengths of the blue and red ends of our spectra are shown in the right panel of Figure 5. We ﬁnd a median blue (red) wavelength limit of 3450 ˚A (10,500 ˚A), and 592 of our spectra cover at least 3700–9800 ˚A. 4.2 Early-time Spectra A number of prior SN Ia analyses (e.g., Riess et al. 1997; Folatelli 2004; Foley et al. 2005; Branch et al. 2006; Gar- avini et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009; Blondin et al. 2012; Silverman et al. 2012b; Folatelli et al. 2013; Childress et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2015) have studied SN Ia optical spectra in terms of multiple “features” — each typically a blend of many spectral transitions, but distinctive enough to be con- sidered in aggregate as a single major absorption feature complex. Of principal interest are assessments of (i) the ex- pansion velocities of such features, and (ii) quantities that probe the relative strengths of the features, often assessed through pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) measurements. Providing a tracer of explosion kinetic energy, the ex- pansion velocities of SN Ia ejecta have been extensively stud- ied — especially during the characteristic decline through the near-maximum evolution (e.g., Benetti et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2009). Silverman et al. (2012b, henceforth S12b) ﬁnd velocities within a few days of maximum brightness that are consistent with the notion that SN Ia ejecta are lay- ered — features of O i, Si ii, and S ii tend to have lower velocities (and are thus found in the inner, more slowly ex- panding layers), while those of Ca ii have the highest ve- locities (and are therefore associated with the outer, more rapidly expanding layers). These ﬁndings are consistent with our own (see Section 4.2.2). Together with probes of fea- ture strength (e.g., pEW measurements), expansion veloci- ties can be used to quantify the degree of homogeneity be- tween spectra of diﬀerent SNe Ia (and hence SNe themselves) at similar epochs, as well as describe the expected tempo- ral evolution of spectral features (Folatelli 2004). Feature- strength measurements from SN Ia spectra are further prized for the prospect that they might correlate with luminosity (e.g., Nugent et al. 1995; Silverman et al. 2012c). Table 3.

Hence, we do not compute expansion velocities for this feature. Following S12b, we measure the expansion velocities, pEWs, and ﬂuxes at the endpoints of nine features in the spectra from our sample which have a light-curve- determined rest-frame phase of < 20 days11. While some studies consider high-velocity and photospheric components for certain features (typically by ﬁtting a series of Gaus- sians to the absorption proﬁle; e.g., Silverman et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2015a; Zhao et al. 2016), we do not draw such a distinction in the following analysis (so as to remain consis- tent with the methodology of S12b). Our selected features, each labeled by the ion or spectral transition line most dom- inant in the absorption, are listed in Table 3 along with their rest wavelengths. Because SN Ia spectra — and hence the aforementioned features — undergo temporal evolution for an individual SN Ia and exhibit variation over many SNe Ia (even when comparing similar epochs), the endpoints of each feature must be determined on a spectrum-by-spectrum basis. To this end we have developed respext12, a Python package for automated SN Ia spectral feature analysis that is an object- oriented and extensively modiﬁed refactorisation (or redux ) of the spextractor13 package. Given an input spectrum, the program smooths14 it using a Savitzky-Golay ﬁlter (Sav- itzky & Golay 1964) and then automatically (or if necessary, manually) selects absorption-feature boundaries, from which pseudo-continua are derived. It then measures the pEWs, expansion velocities, and boundaries of those features. Fig- ure 6 shows the result of this procedure when applied to a spectrum of SN 2016coj near maximum brightness. In the following subsections, we describe our measurement proce- dure in detail and present our results. 11 Two pairs of the selected features (Si ii λ4000, Mg ii; and S ii “W”, Si ii λ5972) become signiﬁcantly blended at the late end of this range, so we therefore only measure these features for tLC ≤ 10 days. 12 https://github.com/benstahl92/respext 13 https://github.com/astrobarn/spextractor 14 In tests, we have found negligible diﬀerence between measure- ments conducted with and without smoothing. Smoothing does, however, allow us to study spectra whose SNRs would otherwise make their measurement unreliable.

We do this by means of a two-step process: (i) we compute the derivative of the smoothed spectrum and identify the wave- lengths corresponding to where it changes from positive to negative (i.e., the wavelengths of local maxima); (ii) of these identiﬁed wavelengths, the one corresponding to the maxi- mum ﬂux of the smoothed spectrum within the blue (red) edge boundary (as given in Table 3) is used to deﬁne the blue (red) edge of the absorption feature. Owing to the fact that the blue end of the O i triplet rarely reaches a local maximum, we follow S12b by modifying our procedure to identify where the derivative passes through −2.0 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 ˚A−2 (moving in the positive direction). We visu- ally inspect all feature boundaries derived from this proce- dure, and infrequently override them by manually selecting boundary points when the original ones are not correct. The 15 The steps performed to homogenise input spectra include cor- recting for Milky Way (MW) reddening using the values given in Table A1 and assuming the extinction law of Cardelli et al. (1989) as modiﬁed by O’Donnell (1994), deredshifting (again using val- ues from Table A1), ﬂux-normalising, and smoothing. uncertainty in the ﬂux at the boundary points is assigned as the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the input and smoothed ﬂuxes within a range identical to the width of the smoothing window centred at the identiﬁed boundary wavelengths. We list all measured feature-boundary ﬂuxes (and their uncertainties) in Table 4. If the blue and red boundaries of a feature are success- fully determined, we deﬁne the pseudo-continuum by con- necting the boundary points with a line. The lower (upper) uncertainty of the pseudo-continuum is derived by connect- ing a line between the boundary points, with their ﬂuxes reduced (increased) by their uncertainties. Once the pseudo- continuum is determined, we calculate the pEW (e.g., Gar- avini et al. 2007, S12b), pEW = N −1Õ i=0 ∆λi (1 − f (λi) fc(λi) ) , (2) where N is the number of pixels between the blue and red boundaries of the feature (which also deﬁne the pseudo- continuum as discussed above), λi (∆λi) is the wavelength (width) of the ith pixel, and f (λi) [ fc(λi)] is the spectrum [pseudo-continuum] ﬂux at λi. The uncertainty in our mea- surement of the pEW is calculated using standard tech- niques of error propagation using both the uncertainty of the pseudo-continuum (as described above) and the uncer- MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) 10 B.

Table 4 includes a column containing all measured pEWs, and we visualise their temporal evolution in Figure 7. In the same ﬁgure, we compare the aggregate pEW evolu- tion for each feature in our dataset to those derived from the dataset of S12b. Given that this comparison is for measure- ments made between diﬀerent (but similarly targeted, ob- served, and reduced) spectra from diﬀerent SNe Ia, we ﬁnd the level of consistency satisfactory. Indeed, the same evolu- tionary trends clearly manifest themselves in both datasets — we mention some of the more noteworthy observations in the following paragraphs. Both the Ca ii H&K feature and Ca ii near-infrared (IR) triplet exhibit relatively large pEWs for tLC ≲ −5 days, but while the former has a pEW that slowly declines through its evolution beyond this point (with noticeably reducing scatter), the pEW of the latter markedly grows. These fea- tures, together with the Fe ii complex (which seems to grow quadratically for tLC ≳ −8 days), have the largest pEWs of all features measured (and are thus in the last row of Fig- ure 7). The Mg ii feature pEW measurements show a modestly increasing trend and have relatively small scatter compared to those for the Si ii λ6355 feature and O i triplet (all three displayed in the central row of Figure 7 owing to their sim- ilar range of values). The O i triplet’s mean pEW evolution appears to consist of several distinct stages: there is an in- crease for tLC ≲ 5 days, at which point the evolution reaches a broad peak of ∼ 120 ˚A, and then there is a stage of de- crease. The mean pEW evolution of the S ii “W” feature fol- MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) BSNIP Spectroscopy of 247 SNe Ia 11 lows a similar trend, except that the peak of ∼ 80 ˚A occurs a few days earlier and is more sharply deﬁned. Si ii λ6355, the most characteristic spectral feature of SNe Ia near maximum brightness, shows relatively ﬂat pEW evolution (∼ 100 ˚A) for tLC ≲ 10 days, after which our mea- surements are consistent with a “hint of sharp upturn” as was noted by S12b, and which is likely due to blending with Si ii λ5972 at such epochs. Similarly, the Si ii λ5972 feature exhibits relatively constant (if slightly increasing) pEW evo- lution until tLC ≈ 5 days, at which phase there is an uptick, likely due to blending with the Na i D line (from the MW, and owing to their low redshifts, possibly from the host galaxies of the SNe). The Si ii λ4000 feature has the low- est aggregate pEWs in our sample (hence its position in the ﬁrst row of Figure 7, along with the measurements for Si ii λ5972 and S ii “W”), and shows evidence for a slight trend of increasing pEW. 4.2.2 Expansion Velocities With feature boundaries determined according to Sec- tion 4.2.1, we identify the absorption minimum (wavelength and ﬂux) in each feature by ﬁtting the smoothed ﬂux (within each feature boundary) with a cubic spline and computing the minimum. We do this for all features with identiﬁed boundaries except for Mg ii and Fe ii, which are compos- ites of so many blended lines that there is ambiguity when choosing a reference wavelength against which to measure expansion velocities. The S ii “W” feature has two broad ab- sorptions, so for consistency — both internally and with the results described by S12b — we always measure the min- imum of the redder of the two features (even if the bluer component has a deeper absorption). As with measurements of feature boundaries, we perform a visual inspection, and in cases where the spline ﬁt does not accurately reﬂect the true ﬂux minimum we manually adjust the range over which the spline is ﬁt in order to more faithfully capture the signal. Fol- lowing S12b, we impose a 2 ˚A uncertainty on the wavelength of the feature minimum (and do not explicitly account for systematic uncertainties due to the spectral resolution). To calculate the expansion velocity of a feature, v, we use the wavelength of its ﬂux minimum (as determined above) and the appropriate rest wavelength (as given in Ta- ble 3) with the relativistic Doppler equation. The uncer- tainty in the expansion velocity is obtained by propagating the wavelength uncertainty (as described above). We present all of our velocity measurements in Table 4. We emphasise that they are derived from blueshifted spectral features (and hence appear as negative number in the table). All veloc- ity measurements are shown in Figure 8, and the aggregate results are compared to those derived from the dataset of S12b. As with the pEW comparison, we ﬁnd clear quali- tative consistency in evolutionary trends (especially given some allowance for biases due to low-number statistics at the earliest epochs). Similar to S12b, we ﬁnd the highest expansion velocities from the two Ca ii features we investigated. The features exhibit similar evolution, with velocities in excess of 25, 000 km s−1 (and as high as ∼ 30, 000 km s−1) for t ≲ −5 days, followed by a rapid decline to relative constancy (slightly decreasing for Ca ii H&K) at ∼ 12, 000 km s−1 for t ≳ 0 days. All three features of Si ii show a similar evolutionary track of modest decline, albeit with diﬀerent scales. The largest velocities are claimed by Si ii λ6355, followed by Si ii λ5972 (both of which converge to a steady velocity of ∼ 11, 000 km s−1 for t ≳ 0 days), and ﬁnally Si ii λ4000 (which continues to decline throughout the evolution). The veloc- ity of the S ii “W” feature shows a very similar evolution to that of Si ii λ4000, but with a bit more scatter and a slightly steeper decline. The expansion velocities of the O i triplet cover a sim- ilar range of values to those of the Si ii “W” feature, but with a signiﬁcantly larger degree of scatter (especially for later epochs). This is unsurprising: the O i triplet is a broad feature, and thus when it becomes weak (as it does at later phases, as shown in Figure 7) the exact location of the mini- mum is more challenging to robustly determine. It is diﬃcult to quantify the extent to which this mechanism introduces scatter relative to what may be intrinsic, but after visually inspecting the results, we ﬁnd the derived minima to be rea- sonable. 4.3 Late-time Spectra As a SN Ia reaches the so-called nebular phase in its evo- lution (starting t ≳ 100 days after maximum light, and fully for t ≳ 160 days), the density of the ejecta diminishes to the point of becoming optically thin, thereby allowing light from deep within the interior to escape. This results in broad emission lines (due mostly to iron-group elements) in the late-time optical spectra of SNe Ia, which may encode important physical and geometric details of the explosion mechanism(s) (Maeda et al. 2010b; Maguire et al. 2018). In particular, many studies of late-time SN Ia spectra have considered three broad emission features centred near 4701, 6155, and 7378 ˚A, which are attributed to blends of various lines of [Fe iii], [Fe ii], and [Ni ii], respectively (Mazzali et al. 1998; Maeda et al. 2010a; Blondin et al. 2012; Silverman et al. 2013; Maguire et al. 2018). Of the spectra in our dataset having light-curve- determined phases, there are 15 (spanning 7 SNe Ia) for which tLC ≥ 160 days. Though this is not a suﬃciently large sample to perform a stand-alone study (and because a sub- set of these spectra have already been considered in other works; see the references listed in Table 1), we perform only a brief analysis focusing on the velocity shift of the [Fe iii] λ4701 feature and the mean velocity shift of the two remain- ing features (which, for consistency with the aforementioned studies, we refer to as the “nebular velocity”). We describe our methodology and measurements in the following subsec- tions. 4.3.1 Methodology We measure velocities of the listed features in our nebular spectra using tools from our respext package. Again, we preprocess spectra by correcting for Galactic extinction and then deredshifting, ﬂux-normalising, and smoothing. Emis- sion peaks are identiﬁed by eye and then, following the ap- proach described in Section 4.2.2, we ﬁt a cubic spline to the smoothed spectrum in the vicinity of the peak, allowing us to derive the wavelength at which the ﬂux is maximal. Con- sistent with our treatment of early-time spectra, we impose MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) 12 B. E.

Evolution of pEWs for the features noted in Table 3, grouped by pEW magnitude. Grey circles are measured pEWs for spectra belonging to SNe classiﬁed as “Ia-norm” according to the prescription of Section 3, and grey squares are those for SNe classiﬁed as “Ia” of any subtype (except “Ia-norm”) or “Ia” with no subtype determined. The red line and ﬁlled region represent the mean and standard deviation (respectively) of all “Ia-norm” measurements within four days of each half-day increment in the evolution, and the dashed blue lines represent the corresponding descriptors derived from the dataset of S12b. The feature and number of “Ia-norm” measurements for it are included in each panel. a uniform 2 ˚A uncertainty on all wavelengths determined by this method. The velocity of the feature is then obtained using the relativistic Doppler equation. Our results are sum- marised in Table 5. 4.3.2 [Fe iii] λ4701 Velocities We present our measurements of the velocity shifts of the [Fe iii] λ4701 feature in the top panel of Figure 9. Similar to Silverman et al. (2013), we ﬁnd evidence for a slow de- crease in blueshift (i.e., a velocity increase) in the nebular- phase evolution. For the three SNe Ia in our sample having multiple nebular-phase spectra with nonnegligible temporal separation (SN 2011fe, SN 2011by, and SN 2014J), we ﬁnd average velocity increase rates of 15, 11, and 5 km s−1 d−1 (respectively). 4.3.3 Nebular Velocities As with Maeda et al. (2010a), Blondin et al. (2012), and Silverman et al. (2013), we derive nebular velocities as the arithmetic mean of the [Fe ii] λ7155 and [Ni ii] λ7378 fea- ture velocities. Whereas previous studies have determined the uncertainty in the nebular velocity as the diﬀerence be- tween the constituent velocities (Maeda et al. 2010a), or half of this diﬀerence (Silverman et al. 2013), we derive it from MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) BSNIP Spectroscopy of 247 SNe Ia 13 10 0 10 20 4 8 12 Si II 4000 N = 97 10 0 10 20 S II \"W\" N = 99 Ia-norm (four day mean) S12b (four day mean) Ia-norm Ia (not Ia-norm) 10 0 10 20 O I triplet N = 115 10 20 30 Si II 5972 N = 94 Ca II H&K N = 135 Ca II near-IR triplet N = 111 10 0 10 20 10 15 20 Si II 6355 N = 147 tLC (days)Velocity (103 km s1) Figure 8. Same as Figure 7, but for expansion velocities. Though we show positive velocity scales, we reiterate that the velocities correspond to blueshifts. direct propagation of uncertainties. We present our nebu- lar velocity measurements in the bottom panel of Figure 9. In contrast to the slow (but noticeable) increasing trend in the [Fe iii] λ4701 velocities, we ﬁnd an even weaker trend in nebular velocities. For the previously mentioned set of three SNe Ia with multiple nebular spectra, we ﬁnd average veloc- ity increase rates of just 2, 4, and 1 km s−1 d−1 — consistent with the assertion made by Silverman et al. (2013) that a single measurement of the nebular velocity of a given SN Ia is suﬃcient to describe that SN throughout its nebular-phase evolution. 5 CONCLUSION In this paper we present 637 optical spectra collected by the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program using the Kast double spectrograph at Lick Observatory and LRIS at the W. M. Keck Observatory between 2009 and 2018. Careful observa- tion and processing techniques perfected over the last 20+ years are employed to prepare the spectra in a manner that is (i) self-consistent and (ii) consistent with earlier BSNIP spectral data releases (S12a). We employ a robust automated spectral classiﬁcation procedure that uses SNID to derive the type, subtype, red- shift, and rest-frame phase of the spectra in our dataset, achieving a successful result in the majority of cases. Fur- thermore, we perform a study of the results and con- MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) 14 B. E. Stahl et al. Table 5. Late-time SN Ia spectral feature measurements.

Measured velocity shifts from the nebular spectra in our sample. The top panel shows the velocity shifts for the [Fe iii] λ4701 feature, while the bottom shows the nebular velocities (as discussed in Section 4.3.3). SNe Ia with multiple nebular spectra are marked as indicated in the legend and connected by lines. The error bars, which do not account for systematic uncertainties from the resolution of our spectra, are typically smaller than the markers. For a typical resolution of ∼ 10 ˚A, the omitted systematic uncertainty amounts to ∼ 500 km s−1. clude that failures preferentially occur for late-phase spectra (where the temporal coverage of SNID is sparse) and for spec- tra with lower SNRs (and which are thus of lower quality). Where independent measurements (i.e., host-galaxy red- shifts, and light-curve-derived rest-frame phases) are avail- able, we compare them to SNID-based predictions. The red- shifts show negligible diﬀerence in aggregate and have rel- atively small scatter, while the phases have a larger — but still reasonable — scatter (especially when a more tempo- rally restrictive subset is selected). After combining the clas- siﬁcations in cases where multiple spectra are available for a given object, we address the several cases in which a selected object was not classiﬁed as a SN Ia. Ultimately, we obtain a ﬁnal sample of 626 spectra from 242 low-redshift SNe Ia. We study the early-time and late-time properties of our dataset, with emphasis on measurements of the most promi- nent features in SN Ia spectra at such phases. In particular, we measure the expansion velocities, pEWs, and ﬂuxes at the boundaries of nine absorption-feature complexes from the subset of our spectra that were observed within 20 days of maximum light. When we compare with the analogous set of measurements performed on an earlier set of BSNIP spec- tra (S12b), we ﬁnd clear evidence for the same evolutionary behaviours in the features. Similarly, we measure the veloc- ity shifts of three emission features from the subset of our spectra that were observed more than 160 days after maxi- mum light. With just 15 such nebular spectra, our sample is too small to merit a stand-alone study, but we do ﬁnd clear manifestations of the evolutionary behaviours noted by more comprehensive studies. When our dataset is combined with that described by S12a, the BSNIP low-redshift SN Ia spectral dataset reaches nearly 2000 optical spectra, all of which have been handled consistently through all phases of observing and processing. Further utility will be unlocked by considering the afore- mentioned spectral dataset in conjunction with its compan- ion photometric dataset of more than 250 SNe Ia from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search follow-up program (see G10 and S19, for the photometric datasets covering 1998– 2008 and 2009–2018, respectively). In a future study, we will leverage these datasets to explore the extent to which pho- tometrically derived parameters can be reconstructed from SN Ia spectra (Stahl et al., in prep.).

Decl. zhelio a E(B − V )MW b SNIDc # of Firstd Lastd MJDe max Name Date (UT) α(2000) δ(2000) (mag) (sub)type Spectra Epoch Epoch Reference a Host-galaxy heliocentric redshifts are from NED unless marked with a “†” symbol, in which case they are collected using the Open Super- nova Catalog (Guillochon et al. 2017) from the following sources: (c) the supernova catalog of Lennarz et al. (2012), (p) the spectroscopic host-galaxy observations of PTF SNe Ia described by Pan et al. (2014), (t) the TNS, (w) the Weizmann Interactive Supernova Data Repository Yaron & Gal-Yam (WISeREP 2012), or (d) the appropriate discovery or classiﬁcation announcement (e.g., CBET or IAUC). b Extinction is calculated at the SN position using the dust maps of Schlegel et al. (1998) subject to the recalibration of Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011). c SN classiﬁcations are derived from our SNID classiﬁcation scheme, as described in Section 3. Based on the arguments made by Foley et al. (2013), we have relabeled all SNe Ia with a “Ia-02cx” subtype as “Iax”. d First and last observation epochs are in rest-frame days relative to the time of B-band maximum brightness, and are computed using information from the table. e References for the light-curve-determined MJD corresponding to B-band maximum brightness are as follows: (1) S19, (2) Friedman et al. (2015) and references therein, (3) Foley et al. (2018), (4) Krisciunas et al. (2017), (5) Maguire et al. (2014), (6) Khan et al. (2011), (7) Zhang et al. (2014), (8) Yamanaka et al. (2014), (9) Shappee et al. (2016), and (10) Srivastav et al. (2017). MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2019) 22 B. E. Stahl et al. This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX ﬁle prepared by the author.
