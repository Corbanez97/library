Suppose that P (C) > 0 and P (C*) > 0. 1. Are A and B¢ guaranteed to be conditionally independent given C'? « Answer Yes 2. Are A and B guaranteed to be conditionally independent given C¢? « AnsweriNo Solution: 1. We have seen that in any probability model, independence of A and B implies independence of A and B°¢. The conditional model (given C) is just another probability model, so this property remains true. 2. This may be true in some special cases, e.g., if A and B both have zero probability. However, it is in general false. Suppose, for example, that events A and B have nonempty intersection inside C, and are conditionally independent, but have empty intersection inside C, which would make them dependent (given C°).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
