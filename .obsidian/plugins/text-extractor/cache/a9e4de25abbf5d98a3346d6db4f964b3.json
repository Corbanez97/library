Express your answer in terms of p using standard notation (click on the “STANDARD NOTATION\" button below.) P (X >10)=| (-p)*® + Answer: (1-p)\"9 1-p° Solution: We can calculate the desired probability by adding the probabilities of the events {X = 10}, {X = 11}, {X = 12}, etc., and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. However, we can get the answer in an easier way, using the interpretation of geometric random variables as the number of trials until the first success. The event {X > 10} is the event that the the first 9 trials resulted in failure, and therefore its probability is (1 — p)°.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
