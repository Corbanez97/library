classical electricity and magnetism, designed for an undergraduate course at the junior or senior level. It can be covered comfortably in two semesters, maybe even with room to spare for special topics (AC circuits, numerical methods, plasma physics, transmission lines, antenna theory, etc.). A one-semester course could reasonably stop after Chapter 7. Unlike quantum mechanics or thermal physics (for example), there is a fairly general consensus with respect to the teaching of electro- dynamics; the subjects to be included, and even their order of presentation, are not particularly controversial, and textbooks differ mainly in style and tone. My approach is perhaps less formal than most; I think this makes difficult ideas more interesting and accessible. For this new edition I have made a number of small changes, in the interests of clarity and grace. In a few places I have corrected errors or expanded the discussion. I have added some new problems, including a few (flagged by a mouse in the margin) that will require a computer. It seemed worthwhile to provide at least some minimal guidance to those wanting to plot a given field (in the form of representative arrows), to draw a field line (starting from a particular point), or to graph the trajectory of a charged particle moving through a specified electric and/or magnetic field (starting at a particular point with a given velocity). These problems are keyed to Mathematica (specifically, version 13.1), but instructors should have no trouble converting them to other languages, if they prefer. I have added some new commentary on subtle issues: ambiguities in the definition of polarization in crystals, problematic aspects of electric and (especially) magnetic field lines, the awkward role of intrinsic spin (a strictly quantum phenomenon) in a classical discussion of magnetic materials. And I have included more references to the accessible literature (par- ticularly the American Journal of Physics). I realize, of course, that most readers will not have the time or inclination to consult these resources, but I think it is worthwhile anyway, if only to emphasize that electrodynamics, notwithstanding its venerable age, is very much alive, and intriguing new discoveries are being made all the time. I hope that occasionally a problem will pique your curiosity, and you will be inspired to look up the references – some of them are real gems. I have maintained three items of unorthodox notation: • The Cartesian unit vectors are written ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz (and, in general, all unit vectors inherit the letter of the corresponding coordinate). xii Preface x y d z r r Source point Field point τ • The distance from the z-axis in cylindrical coordinates1 is designated by s, to avoid confusion with r (the distance from the origin, and the radial coordinate in the spherical system). • The script letter denotes the vector from a source point r′ to the field point r, as in the figure above. Some authors prefer the more explicit (r − r′). But this makes many equations distractingly cumbersome, espe- cially when the unit vector ˆ is involved. I realize that unwary readers are tempted to interpret as r – it certainly makes the integrals easier! Please take note: ≡ (r − r′), which is not thesameas r. I think it’s good notation, but it does have to be handled with care. 2 As in previous editions, I distinguish two kinds of problems. Some have a specific pedagogical purpose, and should be worked immediately after reading the section to which they pertain; these I have placed at the pertinent point within the chapter. (In a few cases the solution to a problem is used later in the text; these are indicated by a bullet (•) in the left margin.) Longer problems, or those of a more general nature, will be found at the end of each chapter. When I teach the subject, I assign some of these, and work a few of them in class. Unusually challenging problems are flagged by an exclamation point (!) in the margin. Many readers have asked that the answers to problems be provided at the back of the book; unfortunately, just as many are strenuously opposed. I have compromised, supplying answers when this seems particularly appropriate. A complete solution manual is available (to instructors) from the publisher; go to the Cambridge University Press website (www.cambridge.org/electrodynamics5e)toorder acopy. I have benefitted from the comments of many colleagues. I cannot list them all here, but I would like to thank the following people for especially useful contributions to this edition: Catherine Crouch (Swarthmore), Ted Jacobson (Maryland), Don Koks (Adelaide), T.

Advertisement WHAT IS ELECTRODYNAMICS, AND HOW DOES IT FIT INTO THE GENERAL SCHEME OF PHYSICS? Four Realms of Mechanics In the diagram below, I have sketched out the four great realms of mechanics: Classical Mechanics Quantum Mechanics (Newton) (Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, et al.) Special Relativity Quantum Field Theory (Einstein) (Dirac, Pauli, Feynman, Schwinger, et al.) Newtonian mechanics is adequate for most purposes in “everyday life,” but for objects moving at high speeds (near the velocity of light) it is incorrect, and must be replaced by special relativity (introduced by Einstein in 1905); for objects that are extremely small (near the size of atoms) it fails for different reasons, and is superseded by quantum mechanics (developed by Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and many others, in the 1920s, mostly). For objects that are both very fast and very small (as is common in modern particle physics), a mechanics that combines relativity and quantum principles is in order; this relativistic quantum mechanics is known as quantum field theory – it was worked out in the thirties and forties, but even today it cannot claim to be a completely satisfactory system. In this book, save for the last chapter, we shall work exclusively in the domain of classical mechanics, although electrodynamics extends with unique simplicity to the other three realms. (In fact, the theory is in most respects automatically consistent with special relativity, for which it was, historically, the main stimulus.) But please remember, this is a book about classical (and in Chapter 12 relativistic) electrodynamics; there is no quantum mechanics here, and you can’t expect the theory to explain everything. As we’ll see in Chapter 6, the classical theory struggles to provide even a qualitative account of magnetic materials. And there is no mention of the photon (well … that’s not quite true: the photon does make a brief appearance in Chapter 12, as an example of a massless particle, but xv Advertisement never in its more significant role as the quantum of the electromagnetic field). Classical electrodynamics describes a possible world, but it is not in every detail the world we actually inhabit; there’s more to the story. Four KindsofForces Mechanics tells us how a system will behave when subjected to a given force. There are just four fundamental forces known (presently) to physics; I list them in the order of decreasing strength: (1) Strong (2) Electromagnetic (3) Weak (4) Gravitational The brevity of this list may surprise you. Where is friction? Where is the “normal” force that keeps you from falling through the floor? Where are the chemical forces that bind molecules together? Where is the force of impact between two colliding billiard balls? The answer is that all these forces are electromagnetic. Indeed, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that we live in an electromagnetic world – practically every force we experience in everyday life, with the exception of gravity, is electromagnetic at its core. The strong forces, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus, have extremely short range, so we do not “feel” them, in spite of the fact that they are a hundred times more powerful than electrical forces. The weak forces, which account for certain kinds of radioactive decay, are also of short range, and they are far weaker than electromagnetic forces. As for gravity, it is so pitifully feeble (compared to all of the others) that it is only by virtue of huge mass concentrations (like the Earth and the Sun) that we ever notice it at all. The electrical repulsion between two electrons is 10 42 times as large as their gravitational attraction, and if atoms were held together by gravitational (instead of electrical) forces, a single hydrogen atom would be much larger than the known Universe. Not only are electromagnetic forces overwhelmingly dominant in every- day life, they are also, at present, the only ones that are completely under- stood. There is, of course, a classical theory of gravity (Newton’s law of universal gravitation) and a relativistic one (Einstein’s general relativity), but no entirely satisfactory quantum mechanical theory of gravity has been constructed (though many people are working on it). At the present time there is a very successful (if cumbersome) theory for the weak interactions, and a strikingly attractive candidate (called chromodynamics) for the strong interactions. All these theories draw their inspiration from electrodynamics; none can claim conclusive experimental verification at this stage. So electro- dynamics, a beautifully complete and successful theory, has become a kind of paradigm for physicists: an ideal model that other theories emulate. xvi Advertisement The laws of classical electrodynamics were discovered in bits and pieces by Franklin, Coulomb, Ampère, Faraday, and others, but the person who completed the job, and packaged4 it all in the compact and consistent form it has today, was James Clerk Maxwell. The theory is now about 150 years old. The Unification of Physical Theories In the beginning, electricity and magnetism were entirely separate subjects. The one dealt with glass rods and cat’s fur, pith balls, batteries, currents, electrolysis, and lightning; the other with bar magnets, iron filings, compass needles, and the North Pole. But in 1820, Oersted noticed that an electric current could deflect a magnetic compass needle. Soon afterward, Ampère postulated that all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion. Then, in 1831, Faraday discovered that a moving magnet generates an electric current. By the time Maxwell and Lorentz put the finishing touches on the theory, electricity and magnetism were inextricably inter- twined. They could no longer be regarded as separate subjects, but rather as two aspects of a single subject: electromagnetism. Faraday speculated that light, too, is electrical in nature. Maxwell’s theory provided spectacular justification for this hypothesis, and soon optics – the study of lenses, mirrors, prisms, interference, and diffraction – was incorporated into electromagnetism. Hertz, who presented the decisive experimental confirmation for Maxwell’s theory in 1888, put it this way: “The connection between light and electricity is now established …. In every flame, in every luminous particle, we see an electrical process …. Thus, the domain of electricity extends over the whole of nature. It even affects ourselves intimately: we perceive that we possess … an electrical organ – the eye.” By 1900, then, three great branches of physics – electricity, magnetism, and optics – had merged into a single unified theory. (And it was soon apparent that visible light represents only a tiny “window” in the vast spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, from radio through microwaves, infrared and ultraviolet, to X-rays and gamma rays.) Einstein dreamed of a further unification, which would combine gravity and electrodynamics, in much the same way as electricity and magnetism had been combined a century earlier. His unified field theory was not particularly successful, but in recent years the same impulse has spawned a hierarchy of increasingly ambitious (and speculative) unification schemes, beginning in the 1960s with the electroweak theory of Glashow, Wein- berg, and Salam (which joins the weak and electromagnetic forces), and culminating in the 1980s with the superstring theory (which, according to its proponents, incorporates all four forces in a single “theory of everything”). 4 Actually, the packaging itself was perfected by Oliver Heaviside. xvii Advertisement At each step in this hierarchy, the mathematical difficulties mount, and the gap between inspired conjecture and experimental test widens; nevertheless, it is clear that the unification of forces initiated by electromagnetism has become a major theme in the progress of physics. The Field Formulation of Electrodynamics The fundamental problem a theory of electromagnetism hopes to solve is this: I hold up a bunch of electric charges here (and maybe shake them around). What happens to some other charge, over there? The classical solu- tion takes the form of a field theory: We say that the space around an electric charge is permeated by electric and magnetic fields (the electromagnetic “odor,” as it were, of the charge). A second charge, in the presence of these fields, experiences a force; the fields, then, transmit the influence from one charge to the other – they “mediate” the interaction. When a charge undergoes acceleration, a portion of the field “detaches” itself, in a sense, and travels off at the speed of light, carrying with it energy, momentum, and angular momentum. We call this electromagnetic radiation. Its existence invites (if not compels) us to regard the fields as independent dynamical entities in their own right, every bit as “real” as atoms or baseballs. Our interest accordingly shifts from the study of forces between charges to the theory of the fields themselves. But it takes a charge to produce an electromagnetic field, and it takes another charge to detect one, so we had best begin by reviewing the essential properties of electric charge. Electric Charge (1) Charge comes in two varieties. We call them “plus” and “minus,” because their effects tend to cancel (if you have +q and −q at the same point, electrically it is the same as having no charge there at all). This may seem too obvious to warrant comment, but I encourage you to contemplate other possibilities: What if there were 8 or 10 different species of charge? (In chromodynamics there are, in fact, three quantities analogous to electric charge, each of which may be positive or negative.) Or what if the two kinds did not tend to cancel? The extraordinary fact is that plus and minus charges occur in exactly equal amounts, to fantastic precision, in bulk matter, so that their effects are almost completely neutralized. Were it not for this, we would be subjected to enormous forces: a potato would explode violently if the cancelation were imperfect by as little as one part in 10 10. xviii Advertisement (2) Charge is conserved. It cannot be created or destroyed – what there is now has always been. (A plus charge can “annihilate” an equal minus charge, but a plus charge cannot simply disappear by itself – something must pick up that electric charge.) So the total charge of the Universe is fixed for all time. This is called global conservation of charge. Actually, I can say something much stronger: Global conservation would allow for a charge to disappear in New York and instantly reappear in San Francisco (that wouldn’t affect the total), and yet we know this doesn’t happen. If the charge was in New York and it went to San Francisco, then it must have passed along some continuous path from one to the other. This is called local conservation of charge. Later on we’ll see how to formulate a precise mathematical law expressing local conservation of charge – it’s called the continuity equation. (3) Charge is quantized. Although nothing in classical electrodynamics requires that it be so, the fact is that electric charge comes only in discrete lumps – integer multiples of the basic unit of charge. If we call the charge on the proton +e, then the electron carries charge −e; the neutron charge zero; the pi mesons +e,0,and −e; the carbon nucleus +6e; and so on (never 7.392e,oreven1/2e). 5 This fundamental unit of charge is extremely small, so for practical purposes it is usually appropriate to ignore quantization altogether. Water, too, “really” consists of discrete lumps (molecules), and yet, if you’re taking a drink (or a bath) it’s not unreasonable to think of it as a continuous fluid. This is in fact much closer to Maxwell’s own view; he knew nothing of electrons and protons – he must have pictured charge as a kind of “jelly” that could be divided up into portions of any size and smeared out at will. Units The subject of electrodynamics is plagued by competing systems of units, which sometimes render it difficult for physicists to communicate with one another. The problem is far worse than in mechanics, where Neanderthals still speak of pounds and feet; in mechanics, at least all equations look the same, regardless of the units used to measure quantities. Newton’s second law remains F = ma, whether it is feet–pounds–seconds, kilograms– meters–seconds, or whatever. But this is not so in electromagnetism, where Coulomb’s law may appear variously as F = q1q2 2 ˆ (Gaussian), or F = 1 4πϵ0 q1q2 2 ˆ (SI),or F = 1 4π q1q2 2 ˆ (HL). 5 Actually, protons and neutrons are composed of three quarks, which carry fractional charges (± 2 3 e and ± 1 3 e). However, free quarks do not appear to exist in nature, and in any event, this does not alter the fact that charge is quantized; it merely reduces the size of the basic unit. xix Advertisement Of the systems in common use, the two most popular are Gaussian (cgs) and SI (mks). Elementary particle theorists favor yet a third system: Heaviside– Lorentz. Although Gaussian units offer distinct theoretical advantages, most undergraduate instructors seem to prefer SI, I suppose because they incorporate the familiar household units (volts, amperes, and watts). In this book, therefore, I have used SI units. Appendix C provides a “dictiona” for converting the main results into Gaussian units. 1 Vector Analysis 1.1 Vector Algebra 1.1.1 Vector Operations If you walk 4 miles due north and then 3 miles due east (Fig. 1.1), you will have gone a total of 7 miles, but you’re not 7 miles from where you set out – only 5. We need an arithmetic to describe quantities like this, which evidently do not add in the ordinary way. The reason they don’t, of course, is that displacements (straight line segments going from one point to another) have direction as well as magnitude (length), and it is essential to take both into account when you combine them. Such objects are called vectors: velocity, acceleration, force, and momentum are other examples. By contrast, quantities that have magnitude but no direction are called scalars: examples include mass, charge, density, and temperature. I shall use boldface (A, B, and so on) for vectors and ordinary type for scalars. The magnitude of a vector A is written |A| or, more simply, A. In diagrams, vectors are denoted by arrows: the length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the vector, and the arrowhead indicates its direction. Minus A (−A) is a vector with the same magnitude as A but the opposite direction (Fig. 1.2). Note that vectors have magnitude and direction but not location: a displacement of 4 miles due north from Washington is represented by the same vector as a displacement 4 miles north from Baltimore (neglecting, of course, the curvature of the Earth). On a diagram, therefore, you can slide the arrow around at will, as long as you don’t change its length or direction. 3 mi 5 mi 4 mi Fig. 1.1 \u0002AA Fig. 1.2 2 1Vector Analysis A A B B (A+B) (B+A) Fig. 1.3 \u0002B A(A\u0002B) Fig. 1.4 A 2A Fig. 1.5 B A θ Fig. 1.6 We define four vector operations: addition and three kinds of multiplication. (i) Addition of two vectors. Place the tail of B at the head of A; the sum, A + B, is the vector from the tail of A to the head of B (Fig. 1.3). (This rule generalizes the obvious procedure for combining two displacements.) Addition is commutative: A + B = B + A; 3 miles east followed by 4 miles north gets you to the same place as 4 miles north followed by 3 miles east. Addition is also associative: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). To subtract a vector, add its opposite (Fig. 1.4): A − B = A + (−B). (ii) Multiplication by a scalar. Multiplication of a vector by a posi- tive scalar a multiplies the magnitude but leaves the direction unchanged (Fig. 1.5). (If a is negative, the direction is reversed.) Scalar multiplication is distributive: a(A + B) = aA + aB. (iii) Dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two vectors is defined by A · B ≡ AB cos θ, (1.1) 3 1.1 Vector Algebra where θ is the angle they form when placed tail to tail (Fig. 1.6). Note that A · B is itself a scalar (hence the alternative name scalar product). The dot product is commutative, A · B = B · A, and distributive, A · (B + C) = A · B + A · C. (1.2) Geometrically, A · B is the product of A times the projection of B along A (or the product of B times the projection of A along B). If the two vectors are parallel, then A · B = AB. In particular, for any vector A, A · A = A2. (1.3) If A and B are perpendicular, then A · B = 0. Example 1.1. Let C = A − B (Fig. 1.7), and calculate the dot product of C with itself. Solution. C · C = (A − B) · (A − B) = A · A − A · B − B · A + B · B, or C2 = A2 + B2 − 2AB cos θ. This is the law of cosines. (iv) Cross product of two vectors. The cross product of two vectors is defined by A × B ≡ AB sin θ ˆn, (1.4) where ˆn is a unit vector (vector of magnitude 1) pointing perpendicular to the plane of A and B. (I shall use a hat (ˆ) to denote unit vectors.) Of course, there are two directions perpendicular to any plane: “in” and “out.” The ambiguity is resolved by the right-hand rule: let your fingers point in the direction of the first vector and curl around (via the smaller angle) toward the second; then your thumb indicates the direction of ˆn.(In Fig. 1.8, A × B points into the page; B × A points out of the page.) Note that A × B is itself a vector (hence the alternative name vector product). The cross product is distributive, A × (B + C) = (A × B) + (A × C), (1.5) but not commutative.Infact, (B × A) = −(A × B). (1.6) 4 1Vector Analysis B CA θ Fig. 1.7 B A θ Fig. 1.8 Geometrically, |A × B| is the area of the parallelogram generated by A and B (Fig. 1.8). If two vectors are parallel, their cross product is zero. In particular, A × A = 0 for any vector A.(Here 0 is the zero vector, with magnitude 0.) Problem 1.1. Using the definitions in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.4, and appropriate diagrams, show that the dot product and cross product are distributive: (a) when the three vectors are coplanar; (b) in the general case. ! Problem 1.2. Is the cross product associative? (A × B) × C ? = A × (B × C). If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample (the simpler the better). 1.1.2 Vector Algebra: Component Form In the previous section, I defined the four vector operations (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product) in “abstract” form – that is, without reference to any particular coordinate system. In practice, it is often easier to set up Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and work with vector components.Let ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz be unit vectors parallel to the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively (Fig. 1.9a). An arbitrary vector A canbeexpressedinterms of these basis vectors (Fig. 1.9b): A = Axˆx + Ayˆy + Azˆz. The coefficients Ax, Ay,and Az are the “components” of A; geometrically, they are the projections of A along the three coordinate axes (Ax = A · ˆx, Ay = A · ˆy, Az = A · ˆz). We can now reformulate each of the four vector operations as a rule for manipulating components: A + B = (Axˆx + Ayˆy + Azˆz) + (Bxˆx + Byˆy + Bzˆz) = (Ax + Bx)ˆx + (Ay + By)ˆy + (Az + Bz)ˆz. (1.7) 5 1.1 Vector Algebra (a)x x z y y z (b)x Ax x Ayy Azz y z A ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ Fig. 1.9 Rule (i) To add vectors, add like components: aA = (aAx)ˆx + (aAy)ˆy + (aAz)ˆz. (1.8) Rule (ii) To multiply by a scalar, multiply each component. Because ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, ˆx · ˆx = ˆy · ˆy = ˆz · ˆz = 1, ˆx · ˆy = ˆx · ˆz = ˆy · ˆz = 0. (1.9) Accordingly, A · B = (Axˆx + Ayˆy + Azˆz) · (Bxˆx + Byˆy + Bzˆz) = AxBx + AyBy + AzBz. (1.10) Rule (iii) To calculate the dot product, multiply like components, and add. In particular, A · A = A2 x + A2 y + A2 z, so A = √ A2 x + A2 y + A2 z. (1.11) (This is, if you like, the three-dimensional generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.) Similarly,1 ˆx × ˆx = ˆy × ˆy = ˆz × ˆz = 0, ˆx × ˆy = −ˆy × ˆx = ˆz, ˆy × ˆz = −ˆz × ˆy = ˆx, ˆz × ˆx = −ˆx × ˆz = ˆy. (1.12) Therefore, A × B = (Axˆx + Ayˆy + Azˆz) × (Bxˆx + Byˆy + Bzˆz) = (AyBz − AzBy)ˆx + (AzBx − AxBz)ˆy + (AxBy − AyBx)ˆz. (1.13) 1 These signs pertain to a right-handed coordinate system (x-axis out of the page, y-axis to the right, z-axis up, or any rotated version thereof). In a left-handed system (z-axisdown),the signs would be reversed: ˆx × ˆy = −ˆz, and so on. We shall use right-handed systems exclusively. Always check that you haven’t inadvertently adopted a left-handed system. 6 1Vector Analysis This cumbersome expression can be written more neatly as a determinant: A × B = |||||||| ˆx ˆy ˆz Ax Ay Az Bx By Bz |||||||| . (1.14) Rule (iv) To calculate the cross product, form the determinant whose first row is ˆx, ˆy, ˆz, whose second row is A (in component form), and whose third row is B. Example 1.2. Find the angle between the face diagonals of a cube. z A B (0, 0, 1) y (0, 1, 0) x (1, 0, 0) θ Fig. 1.10 Solution. We might as well use a cube of side 1, and place it as shown in Fig. 1.10, with one corner at the origin. The face diagonals A and B are A = 1ˆx + 0ˆy + 1ˆz, B = 0ˆx + 1ˆy + 1ˆz. So, in component form, A · B = 1 · 0 + 0 · 1 + 1 · 1 = 1. On the other hand, in “abstract” form, A · B = AB cos θ = √2 √2 cos θ = 2 cos θ. Therefore, cos θ = 1/2, or θ = 60 ◦. Of course, you can get the answer more easily by drawing in a diagonal across the top of the cube, completing the equilateral triangle. But in cases where the geometry is not so simple, this device of comparing the abstract and component forms of the dot product can be a very efficient means of finding angles. Problem 1.3. Find the angle between the body diagonals of a cube. Problem 1.4. Use the cross product to find the components of the unit vector ˆn perpendicular to the shaded plane in Fig. 1.11. 7 1.1 Vector Algebra x y z n 1 2 3 ˆ Fig. 1.11 B C An θ ˆ Fig. 1.12 1.1.3 Triple Products Since the cross product of two vectors is itself a vector, it can be dotted or crossed with a third vector to form a triple product. (i) Scalar triple product: A · (B × C). Geometrically, |A · (B × C)| is the volume of the parallelepiped generated by A, B,and C, since |B × C| is the area of the base, and |A cos θ| is the altitude (Fig. 1.12). Evidently, A · (B × C) = B · (C × A) = C · (A × B), (1.15) for they all correspond to the same figure. Note that “alphabetical” order is preserved – in view of Eq. 1.6, the “nonalphabetical” triple products A · (C × B) = B · (A × C) = C · (B × A), have the opposite sign. In component form, A · (B × C) = |||||||| Ax Ay Az Bx By Bz Cx Cy Cz |||||||| . (1.16) Note that the dot and cross can be interchanged: A · (B × C) = (A × B) · C (this follows immediately from Eq. 1.15); however, the placement of the parentheses is critical: (A · B) × C is a meaningless expression – you can’t make a cross product from a scalar and a vector. (ii) Vector triple product: A × (B × C). The vector triple product can be simplified by the so-called BAC–CAB rule: A × (B × C) = B(A · C) − C(A · B). (1.17) Notice that (A × B) × C = −C × (A × B) = −A(B · C) + B(A · C) is an entirely different vector (cross products are not associative). All higher vector products can be similarly reduced, by repeated application 8 1Vector Analysis of Eq. 1.17, so it is never necessary for an expression to contain more than one cross product in any term. For instance, (A × B) · (C × D) = (A · C)(B · D) − (A · D)(B · C), A × [B × (C × D)] = B[A · (C × D)] − (A · B)(C × D). (1.18) Problem 1.5. Prove the BAC–CAB rule by writing out both sides in component form. Problem 1.6. Prove that [A × (B × C)] + [B × (C × A)] + [C × (A × B)] = 0. Under what conditions does A × (B × C) = (A × B) × C? 1.1.4 Position, Displacement, and Separation Vectors The location of a point in three dimensions can be described by listing its Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). The vector to that point from the origin (O) is called the position vector (Fig. 1.13): r ≡ xˆx + yˆy + zˆz. (1.19) I will reserve the letter r for this purpose, throughout the book. Its magni- tude, r = √x2 + y2 + z2, (1.20) is the distance from the origin, and ˆr = r r = xˆx + yˆy + zˆz √ x2 + y2 + z2 (1.21) is a unit vector pointing radially outward. The infinitesimal displacement vector,from (x, y, z) to (x + dx, y + dy, z + dz), is dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz. (1.22) (We could call this dr, since that’s what it is, but it’s useful to have a special notation for infinitesimal displacements.) In electrodynamics, one frequently encounters problems involving two points – typically, a source point, r′, where an electric charge is located, and a field point, r, at which you are calculating the electric or magnetic field (Fig. 1.14). It pays to adopt right from the start some shorthand notation for the separation vector from the source point to the field point. I shall use for this purpose the cursive letter : ≡ r − r′. (1.23) Its magnitude is = |r − r′|, (1.24) 9 1.1 Vector Algebra r y z z yx x (x,y,z) rˆ Fig. 1.13 r r Source point Field point Fig. 1.14 and a unit vector in the direction from r′ to r is ˆ = = r − r′ |r − r′| . (1.25) In Cartesian coordinates, = (x − x′)ˆx + (y − y′)ˆy + (z − z′)ˆz, (1.26) = √(x − x′)2 + (y − y′)2 + (z − z′)2, (1.27) ˆ = (x − x′)ˆx + (y − y′)ˆy + (z − z′)ˆz √(x − x′)2 + (y − y′)2 + (z − z′)2 (1.28) (from which you will appreciate the economy of the script- notation). Problem 1.7. Find the separation vector from the source point (2, 8, 7) to the field point (4, 6, 8). Determine its magnitude ( ), and construct the unit vector ˆ. 1.1.5 How Vectors Transform The2 definition of a vector as “a quantity with a magnitude and direction” is not altogether satisfactory: What precisely does “direction” mean? This may seem a pedantic question, but we shall soon encounter a species of derivative that looks rather like a vector, and we’ll want to know for sure whether it is one. You might be inclined to say that a vector is anything that has three components that combine properly under addition. Well, how about this: We have a barrel of fruit that contains Nx pears, Ny apples, and Nz bananas. Is N = Nxˆx + Nyˆy + Nzˆz a vector? It has three components, and when you add another barrel with Mx pears, My apples, and Mz bananas the result is 2 This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 10 1Vector Analysis y z A ¯ ¯ ¯y z θ φ θ Fig. 1.15 (Nx + Mx) pears, (Ny + My) apples, (Nz + Mz) bananas. So it does add like a vector. Yet it’s obviously not a vector, in the physicist’s sense of the word, because it doesn’t really have a direction. What exactly is wrong with it? The answer is that N does not transform properly when you change coordinates. The coordinate frame we use to describe positions in space is of course entirely arbitrary, but there is a specific geometrical transformation law for converting vector components from one frame to another. Suppose, for instance, the ¯x, ¯y, ¯z system is rotated by angle φ,relativeto x, y, z, about the common x = ¯x-axes. From Fig. 1.15, Ay = A cos θ, Az = A sin θ, while ¯Ay = A cos ¯θ = A cos(θ − φ) = A(cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ) = cos φ Ay + sin φ Az, ¯Az = A sin ¯θ = A sin(θ − φ) = A(sin θ cos φ − cos θ sin φ) = − sin φ Ay + cos φ Az. We might express this conclusion in matrix notation: ( ¯Ay ¯Az ) = ( cos φ sin φ − sin φ cos φ )(Ay Az ) . (1.29) More generally, for rotation about an arbitrary axis in three dimensions, the transformation law takes the form \u0003\u0004\u0004 \u0005 ¯Ax ¯Ay ¯Az \u0006\u0007\u0007 \b = \u0003\u0004\u0004 \u0005 Rxx Rxy Rxz Ryx Ryy Ryz Rzx Rzy Rzz \u0006\u0007\u0007 \b \u0003\u0004\u0004 \u0005 Ax Ay Az \u0006\u0007\u0007 \b , (1.30) or, more compactly, ¯Ai = 3∑ j=1 RijAj, (1.31) where the index 1 stands for x,2for y, and 3 for z. The elements of the matrix R can be ascertained, for a given rotation, by the same sort of trigonometric arguments as we used for a rotation about the x-axis. 11 1.1 Vector Algebra Now, do the components of N transform in this way? Of course not – it doesn’t matter what coordinates you use to represent positions in space; there are still just as many apples in the barrel. You can’t convert a pear into a banana by choosing a different set of axes, but you can turn Ax into ¯Ay. Formally, then, a vector is a set of three components that transforms the same way as (x, y, z) under a rotation of the coordinate axes. As always, displacement is the archetype for the behavior of all vectors. 3 By the way, a (second-rank) tensor is a quantity with nine components, Txx, Txy, Txz, Tyx, ... , Tzz, which transform with two factors of R: ¯T xx = Rxx(RxxTxx + RxyTxy + RxzTxz) + Rxy(RxxTyx + RxyTyy + RxzTyz) + Rxz(RxxTzx + RxyTzy + RxzTzz), ... or, more compactly, ¯T ij = 3∑ k=1 3∑ l=1 RikRjlTkl. (1.32) In general, an nth-rank tensor has n indices and 3 n components, and transforms with n factors of R. In this hierarchy, a vector is a tensor of rank 1, and a scalar is a tensor of rank zero. 4 Problem 1.8. (a) Prove that the two-dimensional rotation matrix (Eq. 1.29) preserves dot products. (That is, show that ¯Ay ¯By + ¯Az ¯Bz = AyBy + AzBz.) (b) What constraints must the elements (Rij) of the three-dimensional rotation matrix (Eq. 1.30) satisfy in order to preserve the length of A (for all vectors A)? Problem 1.9. Find the transformation matrix R that describes a rotation by 120◦ about an axis from the origin through the point (1, 1, 1). The rotation is clockwise as you look down the axis toward the origin. Problem 1.10. Vectors (and scalars, and tensors) are defined by their behavior under a rotation of the coordinate axes. But it is sometimes of interest to enquire how they might transform (using displacements as a model) under other coordinate changes – translations, say, or inversions. 3 If you’re a mathematician you might want to contemplate generalized vector spaces in which the “axes” have nothing to do with direction and the basis vectors are no longer ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz (indeed, there may be more than three dimensions). This is the subject of linear algebra. But for our purposes all vectors live in ordinary 3-space (or, in Chapter 12, in 4-dimensional space-time). 4 A scalar does not change when you change coordinates. In particular, the individual components of a vector are not scalars, but the magnitude is. 12 1Vector Analysis y z x x z (a) ya} z (b) y x x z y ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ Fig. 1.16 (a) How do the components of a vector5 transform under a translation of coordinates ( ¯x = x, ¯y = y − a, ¯z = z, Fig. 1.16a)? (b) How do the components of a displacement transform under an inversion of coordinates ( ¯x = −x, ¯y = −y, ¯z = −z, Fig. 1.16b)? (c) How do the components of a cross product (Eq. 1.13) transform under inversion? (The cross product of two vectors is called a pseudovector because of this “anomalous” behavior under inversions. It’s still a vector – that is determined by its behavior under rotations; where the distinction is at issue I’ll call a vector with the “normal”behavior under inversions an ordinary vector.) Is the cross product of two pseudovectors an ordinary vector, or a pseudovector? Name two pseudovector quantities in classical mechanics. (d) How does the scalar triple product of three vectors transform under inversions? (Such an object is called a pseudoscalar.) 1.2 Differential Calculus 1.2.1 “Ordinary” Derivatives Suppose we have a function of one variable: f (x). Question: What does the derivative, df /dx, do for us? Answer: It tells us how rapidly the function f (x) varies when we change the argument x by a tiny amount, dx: df = ( df dx ) dx. (1.33) In words, if we increment x by an infinitesimal amount dx, then f changes by an amount df ; the derivative is the proportionality factor. For example, 5 Beware: The vector r (Eq. 1.19) goes from a specific point in space (the origin, O)tothe point P = (x, y, z). Under a translation the new origin ( ¯O) is at a different location, and the arrow from ¯O to P is a completely different vector. The original vector r still goes from O to P, regardless of the coordinates used to label these points. 13 1.2 Differential Calculus x f (a) x f (b) Fig. 1.17 in Fig. 1.17a, the function varies slowly with x, and the derivative is correspondingly small. In Fig. 1.17b, f increases rapidly with x, and the derivative is large, as you move away from x = 0. Geometrical Interpretation: The derivative df /dx is the slope of the graph of f versus x. 1.2.2 Gradient Suppose now that we have a function of three variables – say, the temper- ature T (x, y, z) in this room. (Start out in one corner, and set up a system of axes; then for each point (x, y, z) in the room, T gives the temperature at that location.) We want to generalize the notion of “derivative” to functions like T, which depend not on one but on three variables. A derivative is supposed to tell us how fast the function varies if we move a little distance. But this time the situation is more complicated, because it depends on what direction we move: if we go straight up, then the temperature will probably increase fairly rapidly, but if we move horizontally, it may not change much at all. In fact, the question “How fast does T vary?” has an infinite number of answers, one for each direction we might choose to explore. Fortunately, the problem is not as bad as it looks. A theorem on partial derivatives states that dT = ( ∂T ∂x ) dx + ( ∂T ∂y ) dy + ( ∂T ∂z ) dz. (1.34) This tells us how T changes when we alter all three variables by the infinitesimal amounts dx, dy, dz. Notice that we do not require an infinite number of derivatives – three will suffice: the partial derivatives along each of the three coordinate directions. Equation 1.34 is reminiscent of a dot product: dT = ( ∂T ∂x ˆx + ∂T ∂y ˆy + ∂T ∂z ˆz) · (dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz) = (∇T ) · (dl), (1.35) 14 1Vector Analysis where ∇T ≡ ∂T ∂x ˆx + ∂T ∂y ˆy + ∂T ∂z ˆz (1.36) is called the gradient of T. Note that ∇T is a vector quantity, with three components; it is the generalized derivative we have been looking for. Equation 1.35 is the three-dimensional version of Eq. 1.33. Geometrical Interpretation of the Gradient: Like any vector, the gradient has magnitude and direction. To determine its geometrical meaning, let’s rewrite the dot product (Eq. 1.35) using Eq. 1.1: dT = ∇T · dl = |∇T ||dl| cos θ, (1.37) where θ is the angle between ∇T and dl.Now,if we fix the magnitude |dl| and search around in various directions (that is, vary θ), the maximum change in T evidentally occurs when θ = 0 (for then cos θ = 1). That is, for a fixed distance |dl|, dT is greatest when I move in the same direction as ∇T. Thus, the gradient ∇T points in the direction of maximum increase of the function T. Moreover, the magnitude |∇T | gives the slope (rate of increase) along this maximal direction. Imagine you are standing on a hillside. Look all around you, and find the direction of steepest ascent. That is the direction of the gradient. Now measure the slope in that direction (rise over run). That is the magnitude of the gradient. (Here the function we’re talking about is the height of the hill, and the coordinates it depends on are positions – latitude and longitude, say. This function depends on only two variables, not three, but the geometrical meaning of the gradient is easier to grasp in two dimensions.) Notice from Eq. 1.37 that the direction of maximum descent is opposite to the direction of maximum ascent, while at right angles (θ = 90 ◦) the slope is zero (the gradient is perpendicular to the contour lines). You can conceive of surfaces that do not have these properties, but they always have “kinks” in them, and correspond to nondifferentiable functions. What would it mean for the gradient to vanish? If ∇T = 0 at (x, y, z), then dT = 0 for small displacements about the point (x, y, z). This is, then, a stationary point of the function T (x, y, z). It could be a maximum (a summit), a minimum (a valley), a saddle point (a pass), or a “shoulder.” This is analogous to the situation for functions of one variable, where a vanishing derivative signals a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection. In particular, if you want to locate the extrema of a function of three variables, set its gradient equal to zero. 15 1.2 Differential Calculus Example 1.3. Find the gradient of r = √x2 + y2 + z2 (the magnitude of the position vector). Solution. ∇r = ∂r ∂x ˆx + ∂r ∂y ˆy + ∂r ∂zˆz = 1 2 2x √ x2 + y2 + z2 ˆx + 1 2 2y √ x2 + y2 + z2 ˆy + 1 2 2z √x2 + y2 + z2 ˆz = xˆx + yˆy + zˆz √ x2 + y2 + z2 = r r = ˆr. Does this make sense? Well, it says that the distance from the origin increases most rapidly in the radial direction, and that its rate of increase in that direction is 1 … just what you’d expect. Problem 1.11. Find the gradients of the following functions: (a) f (x, y, z) = x2 + y3 + z4. (b) f (x, y, z) = x2y3z4. (c) f (x, y, z) = ex sin(y) ln(z). Problem 1.12. The height of a certain hill (in feet) is given by h(x, y) = 10(2xy − 3x2 − 4y 2 − 18x + 28y + 12), where y is the distance (in miles) north, x the distance east, of South Hadley. (a) Where is the top of the hill located? (b) How high is the hill? (c) How steep is the slope (in feet per mile) at a point 1 mile north and 1 mile east of South Hadley? In what direction is the slope steepest, at that point? • Problem 1.13. Let be the separation vector from a fixed point (x′, y′, z′) to the point (x, y, z), and let be its length. Show that (a) ∇( 2) = 2 ; (b) ∇(1/ ) = −ˆ/ 2. (c) What is the general formula for ∇( n)? 16 1Vector Analysis ! Problem 1.14. Suppose f is a function of two variables (y and z) only. Show that the gra- dient ∇f = (∂f /∂y)ˆy + (∂f /∂z)ˆz transforms as a vector under rotations, Eq. 1.29.[Hint: (∂f /∂ ¯y) = (∂f /∂y)(∂y/∂ ¯y)+(∂f /∂z)(∂z/∂ ¯y), and the analogous formula for ∂f /∂ ¯z. We know that ¯y = y cos φ+z sin φ and ¯z = −y sin φ+z cos φ; “solve”these equations for y and z (as functions of ¯y and ¯z), and compute the needed derivatives ∂y/∂ ¯y, ∂z/∂ ¯y,etc.] 1.2.3 The Del Operator The gradient has the formal appearance of a vector, ∇, “multiplying” a scalar T: ∇T = (ˆx ∂ ∂x + ˆy ∂ ∂y + ˆz ∂ ∂z )T. (1.38) (For once, I write the unit vectors to the left, just so no one will think this means ∂ˆx/∂x, and so on – which would be zero, since ˆx is constant.) The term in parentheses is called del: ∇ = ˆx ∂ ∂x + ˆy ∂ ∂y + ˆz ∂ ∂z . (1.39) Of course, del is not a vector, in the usual sense. Indeed, it doesn’t mean much until we give it a function to act on. Furthermore, it does not “multiply” T; rather, it is an instruction to differentiate what follows. To be precise, then, we say that ∇ is a vector operator that acts upon T, not a vector that multiplies T. With this qualification, though, ∇ mimics the behavior of an ordinary vector in virtually every way; almost anything that can be done with other vectors can also be done with ∇, if we merely translate “multiply” as “act upon.” So by all means take the vector appearance of ∇ seriously: it is a marvelous piece of notational simplification, as you will appreciate if you ever consult Maxwell’s original work on electromagnetism, written without the benefit of ∇. Now, an ordinary vector A can multiply in three ways: (1) byascalar a: Aa; (2) byavector B via the dot product: A · B; (3) byavector B via the cross product: A × B. Correspondingly, there are three ways the operator ∇ can act: (1) on a scalar function T: ∇T (the gradient); (2) on a vector function v via the dot product: ∇ · v (the divergence); (3) on a vector function v via the cross product: ∇ × v (the curl). I have already discussed the gradient. In the following sections we examine the other two vector derivatives: divergence and curl. 17 1.2 Differential Calculus (b)(a) (c) Fig. 1.18 1.2.4 The Divergence From the definition of ∇ we construct the divergence: ∇ · v = (ˆx ∂ ∂x + ˆy ∂ ∂y + ˆz ∂ ∂z ) · (vxˆx + vyˆy + vzˆz) = ∂vx ∂x + ∂vy ∂y + ∂vz ∂z . (1.40) Observe that the divergence of a vector function6 v is itself a scalar, ∇ · v. Geometrical Interpretation: The name divergence is well chosen, for ∇ · v is a measure of how much the vector v spreads out (diverges) from the point in question. For example, the vector function in Fig. 1.18a has a large (posi- tive) divergence (if the arrows pointed in, it would be a negative divergence), the function in Fig. 1.18b has zero divergence, and the function in Fig. 1.18c again has a positive divergence. (Please understand that v here is a function – there’s a vector associated with every point in space. In the diagrams, of course, I can only draw the arrows at a few representative locations.) Imagine standing at the edge of a pond. Sprinkle some sawdust or pine needles on the surface. If the material spreads out, then you dropped it at a point of positive divergence; if it collects together, you dropped it at a point of negative divergence. (The vector function v in this model is the velocity of the water at the surface – this is a two-dimensional example, but it helps give one a “feel” for what the divergence means. A point of positive divergence is a source, or “faucet”; a point of negative divergence is a sink, or “drain.”) Example 1.4. Suppose the functions in Fig. 1.18 are va = r = xˆx + yˆy + zˆz, vb = ˆz,and vc = zˆz. Calculate their divergences. Solution. ∇ · va = ∂ ∂x (x) + ∂ ∂y (y) + ∂ ∂z (z) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3; 6 A vector function v(x, y, z) = vx (x, y, z)ˆx + vy (x, y, z)ˆy + vz (x, y, z)ˆz is really three functions – one for each component. There’s no such thing as the divergence of a scalar. 18 1Vector Analysis as anticipated, this function has a positive divergence. ∇ · vb = ∂ ∂x (0) + ∂ ∂y (0) + ∂ ∂z (1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, as expected. ∇ · vc = ∂ ∂x (0) + ∂ ∂y (0) + ∂ ∂z (z) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. Problem 1.15. Calculate the divergence of the following vector functions: (a) va = x2ˆx + 3xz2ˆy − 2xzˆz. (b) vb = xyˆx + 2yzˆy + 3zxˆz. (c) vc = y2ˆx + (2xy + z2)ˆy + 2yzˆz. • Problem 1.16. Sketch the vector function v = ˆr r2 , and compute its divergence. The answer may surprise you … how do you account for it? ! Problem 1.17. In two dimensions, show that the divergence transforms as a scalar under rotations. [Hint: Use Eq. 1.29 to determine ¯vy and ¯vz, and the method of Prob. 1.14 to calculate the derivatives. Your aim is to show that ∂ ¯vy/∂ ¯y + ∂ ¯vz/∂ ¯z = ∂vy/∂y + ∂vz/∂z.] 1.2.5 The Curl From the definition of ∇ we construct the curl: ∇ × v = |||||||| ˆx ˆy ˆz ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z vx vy vz |||||||| = ˆx( ∂vz ∂y − ∂vy ∂z ) + ˆy( ∂vx ∂z − ∂vz ∂x ) + ˆz( ∂vy ∂x − ∂vx ∂y ). (1.41) Notice that the curl of a vector function 7 v is, like any cross product, a vector. Geometrical Interpretation: The name curl is also well chosen, for ∇ × v is a measure of how much the vector v swirls around the point in question. Thus the three functions in Fig. 1.18 all have zero curl (as you can easily check, using the expressions in Ex. 1.4), whereas the functions in Fig. 1.19 have a substantial curl, pointing in the z direction, as the natural right-hand rule would suggest. Imagine (again) you are standing at the edge of a pond. 7 There’s no such thing as the curl of a scalar. 19 1.2 Differential Calculus Float a small paddlewheel (a cork with toothpicks pointing out radially would do); if it starts to rotate, then you placed it at a point of nonzero curl. A whirlpool would be a region of large curl. Example 1.5. Suppose the function sketched in Fig. 1.19a is va = −yˆx + xˆy, and that in Fig. 1.19b is vb = xˆy. Calculate their curls. Solution. ∇ × va = |||||||| ˆx ˆy ˆz ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z −yx 0 |||||||| = 2ˆz and ∇ × vb = |||||||| ˆx ˆy ˆz ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z 0 x 0 |||||||| = ˆz. As expected, these curls point in the +z direction. (Incidentally, they both have zero divergence, as you might guess from the pictures: nothing is “spreading out” … it just “swirls around.”) z x (a) y x (b) y z Fig. 1.19 Problem 1.18. Calculate the curls of the vector functions in Prob. 1.15. Problem 1.19. Draw a circle in the xy plane. At a few representative points draw the unit vector v tangent to the circle, pointing in the clockwise direction. By comparing adjacent vectors, determine the signs of ∂vx/∂y and ∂vy/∂x. According to Eq. 1.41 then, what is the direction of ∇ × v? Problem 1.20. Construct a vector function that has zero divergence and zero curl every- where. (A constant will do the job, of course, but make it something a little more interesting than that!) 20 1Vector Analysis 1.2.6 Product Rules The calculation of ordinary derivatives is facilitated by a number of rules, such as the sum rule: d dx (f + g) = df dx + dg dx , the rule for multiplying by a constant (c): d dx (cf ) = c df dx , the product rule: d dx (fg) = f dg dx + g df dx , and the quotient rule: d dx ( f g ) = g df dx − f dg dx g2 . Similar relations hold for the vector derivatives. Thus, ∇(f + g) = ∇f + ∇g, ∇ · (A + B) = (∇ · A) + (∇ · B), ∇ × (A + B) = (∇ × A) + (∇ × B), and ∇(cf ) = c∇f , ∇ · (cA) = c(∇ · A), ∇ × (cA) = c(∇ × A), as you can check for yourself. The product rules are not quite so simple. There are two ways to construct a scalar as the product of two functions: fg (product of two scalar functions), A · B (dot product of two vector functions), and two ways to make a vector: f A (scalar times vector), A × B (cross product of two vectors). Accordingly, there are six product rules, two for gradients: (i) ∇(fg) = f ∇g + g∇f ; (ii) ∇(A · B) = A × (∇ × B) + B × (∇ × A) + (A · ∇)B + (B · ∇)A; two for divergences: (iii) ∇ · (f A) = f (∇ · A) + A · (∇f ); (iv) ∇ · (A × B) = B · (∇ × A) − A · (∇ × B); 21 1.2 Differential Calculus and two for curls: (v) ∇ × (f A) = f (∇ × A) − A × (∇f ); (vi) ∇ × (A × B) = (B · ∇)A − (A · ∇)B + A(∇ · B) − B(∇ · A). You will be using these product rules so frequently that I have put them inside the front cover for easy reference. The proofs come straight from the product rule for ordinary derivatives. For instance, ∇ · (f A) = ∂ ∂x (fAx) + ∂ ∂y (fAy) + ∂ ∂z (fAz) = ( ∂f ∂x Ax + f ∂Ax ∂x ) + ( ∂f ∂y Ay + f ∂Ay ∂y ) + ( ∂f ∂z Az + f ∂Az ∂z ) = (∇f ) · A + f (∇ · A). It is also possible to formulate three quotient rules: ∇( f g ) = g∇f − f ∇g g2 , ∇ · ( A g ) = g(∇ · A) − A · (∇g) g2 , ∇ × ( A g ) = g(∇ × A) + A × (∇g) g2 . However, since these can be obtained quickly from the corresponding product rules, there is no point in listing them separately. Problem 1.21. Proveproduct rules(i),(iv), and(v). Problem 1.22. (a) If A and B are two vector functions, what does the expression (A · ∇)B mean? (That is, what are its x, y,and z components, in terms of the Cartesian components of A, B,and ∇?) (b) Compute (ˆr · ∇)ˆr,where ˆr is the unit vector defined in Eq. 1.21. (c) For the functions in Prob. 1.15, evaluate (va · ∇)vb. Problem 1.23. (For masochists only.) Prove product rules (ii) and (vi). Refer to Prob. 1.22 for the definition of (A · ∇)B. Problem 1.24. Derive the three quotient rules. 22 1Vector Analysis Problem 1.25. (a) Check product rule (iv) (by calculating each term separately) for the functions A = xˆx + 2yˆy + 3zˆz, B = 3yˆx − 2xˆy. (b) Do the same for product rule (ii). (c) Dothe same forrule(vi). 1.2.7 Second Derivatives Gradient, divergence, and curl are the only first derivatives we can make with ∇; by applying ∇ twice, we can construct five species of second derivatives. The gradient ∇T is a vector,sowecantake the divergence and curl of it: (a) Divergence of gradient: ∇ · (∇T ). (b) Curl of gradient: ∇ × (∇T ). The divergence ∇ · v is a scalar –all we candoistakeits gradient: (c) Gradient of divergence: ∇(∇ · v). The curl ∇ × v is a vector, so we can take its divergence and curl: (d) Divergence of curl: ∇ · (∇ × v). (e) Curl of curl: ∇ × (∇ × v). This exhausts the possibilities, and in fact not all of them give us anything new. Let’s consider them one at a time: (1) ∇ · (∇T ) = (ˆx ∂ ∂x + ˆy ∂ ∂y + ˆz ∂ ∂z ) · ( ∂T ∂x ˆx + ∂T ∂y ˆy + ∂T ∂z ˆz) = ∂2T ∂x2 + ∂2T ∂y2 + ∂2T ∂z2 . (1.42) This object, which we write as ∇ 2T for short, is called the Laplacian of T; we shall be studying it in great detail later on. Notice that the Laplacian of a scalar T is a scalar. Occasionally, we shall speak of the Laplacian of a vector, ∇ 2v. By this we mean a vector quantity whose x-component is the Laplacian of vx, and so on:8 ∇ 2v ≡ (∇ 2vx)ˆx + (∇ 2vy)ˆy + (∇ 2vz)ˆz. (1.43) This is nothing more than a convenient extension of the meaning of ∇ 2. (2) The curl of a gradient is always zero: ∇ × (∇T ) = 0. (1.44) This is an important fact, which we shall use repeatedly; you can easily prove it from the definition of ∇, Eq. 1.39. Beware: You might think 8 In curvilinear coordinates, where the unit vectors themselves depend on position, they too must be differentiated (see Section 1.4.1). 23 1.2 Differential Calculus Eq. 1.44 is “obviously” true – isn’t it just (∇ × ∇)T, and isn’t the cross product of any vector (in this case, ∇) with itself always zero? This reasoning is suggestive, but not quite conclusive, since ∇ is an operator and does not “multiply” in the usual way. The proof of Eq. 1.44,infact, hinges on the equality of cross derivatives: ∂ ∂x ( ∂T ∂y ) = ∂ ∂y ( ∂T ∂x ). (1.45) If you think I’m being fussy, test your intuition on this one: (∇T ) × (∇S). Is that always zero? (It would be, of course, if you replaced the ∇sbyan ordinary vector.) (3) ∇(∇·v) seldom occurs in physical applications, and it has not been given any special name of its own – it’s just the gradient of the divergence. Notice that ∇(∇ · v) is not the same as the Laplacian of a vector: ∇ 2v = (∇ · ∇)v \u0002 ∇(∇ · v). (4) The divergence of a curl, like the curl of a gradient, is always zero: ∇ · (∇ × v) = 0. (1.46) You can prove this for yourself. (Again, there is a fraudulent shortcut proof, using the vector identity A · (B × C) = (A × B) · C.) (5) As you can check from the definition of ∇, ∇ × (∇ × v) = ∇(∇ · v) −∇2v. (1.47) So curl-of-curl gives nothing new; the first term is just number (3), and the second is the Laplacian (of a vector). (In fact, Eq. 1.47 is oftenusedto define the Laplacian of a vector, in preference to Eq. 1.43, which makes explicit reference to Cartesian coordinates.) Really, then, there are just two kinds of second derivatives: the Lapla- cian (which is of fundamental importance) and the gradient-of-divergence (which we seldom encounter). I could go through a similar exercise to work out third derivatives, but fortunately second derivatives suffice for most physical applications. A final word on vector differential calculus: It all flows from the operator ∇, and from taking seriously its vectorial character. Even if you remem- bered only the definition of ∇, you could easily reconstruct all the rest. Problem 1.26. Calculate the Laplacian of the following functions: (a) Ta = x2 + 2xy + 3z + 4. (b) Tb = sin x sin y sin z. (c) Tc = e−5x sin 4y cos 3z. (d) v = x2ˆx + 3xz2ˆy − 2xzˆz. 24 1Vector Analysis Problem 1.27. Prove that the divergence of a curl is always zero. Check it for function va in Prob. 1.15. Problem 1.28. Prove that the curl of a gradient is always zero. Check it for function (b) in Prob. 1.11. 1.3 Integral Calculus 1.3.1 Line, Surface, and Volume Integrals In electrodynamics, we encounter several different kinds of integrals, among which the most important are line (or path) integrals, surface integrals (or flux), and volume integrals. (a) Line Integrals. A line integral is an expression of the form ∫ b a v · dl, (1.48) where v is a vector function, dl is the infinitesimal displacement vector (Eq. 1.22), and the integral is to be carried out along a prescribed path from point a to point b (Fig. 1.20). If the path in question forms a closed loop (that is, if b = a), I shall put a circle on the integral sign: ∮ v · dl. (1.49) At each point on the path, we take the dot product of v (evaluated at that point) with the displacement dl to the next point along the path. To a physicist, the most familiar example of a line integral is the work done by aforce F: W = ∫ F · dl. Ordinarily, the value of a line integral depends critically on the path taken from a to b, but there is an important special class of vector functions for which the line integral is independent of path and is determined entirely by the end points. It will be our business in due course to characterize this special class of vectors. (A force that has this property is said to be conservative.) Example 1.6. Calculate the line integral of the function v = y 2ˆx + 2x(y + 1)ˆy from the point a = (1, 1, 0) to the point b = (2, 2, 0), along the paths (1) and (2) in Fig. 1.21. What is ∮ v · dl for the loop that goes from a to b along (1) and returns to a along (2)? Solution. As always, dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz. Path (1) consists of two parts. Along the “horizontal” segment, dy = dz = 0, so 25 1.3 Integral Calculus y z x a bdl Fig. 1.20 x y 2 1 21 (2) (1)(i) (ii) b a Fig. 1.21 (i) dl = dx ˆx, y = 1, v · dl = y 2 dx = dx,so ∫ v · dl = ∫ 2 1 dx = 1. On the “vertical” stretch, dx = dz = 0, so (ii) dl = dy ˆy, x = 2, v · dl = 2x(y + 1) dy = 4(y + 1) dy,so ∫ v · dl = 4 ∫ 2 1 (y + 1) dy = 10. By path (1), then, ∫ b a v · dl = 1 + 10 = 11. Meanwhile, on path (2) x = y, dx = dy,and dz = 0, so dl = dx ˆx + dx ˆy, v · dl = x2 dx + 2x(x + 1) dx = (3x 2 + 2x) dx,and ∫ b a v · dl = ∫ 2 1 (3x 2 + 2x) dx = (x 3 + x 2)|2 1 = 10. (The strategy here is to get everything in terms of one variable; I could just as well have eliminated x in favor of y.) For the loop that goes out (1) and back (2), then, ∮ v · dl = 11 − 10 = 1. (b) Surface Integrals. A surface integral is an expression of the form ∫ S v · da, (1.50) where v is again some vector function, and the integral is over a specified surface S.Here da is an infinitesimal patch of area, with direction per- pendicular to the surface (Fig. 1.22). There are, of course, two directions perpendicular to any surface, so the sign of a surface integral is intrinsically ambiguous. If the surface is closed (forming a “balloon”), in which case I shall again put a circle on the integral sign ∮ v · da, 26 1Vector Analysis x y z da Fig. 1.22 x y z (iii) (ii) (i) (v) (iv) 2 2 2 Fig. 1.23 then tradition dictates that “outward” is positive, but for open surfaces it’s arbitrary. If v describes the flow of a fluid (mass per unit area per unit time), then ∫ v · da represents the total mass per unit time passing through the surface – hence the alternative name, “flux.” Ordinarily, the value of a surface integral depends on the particular surface chosen, but there is a special class of vector functions for which it is independent of the surface and is determined entirely by the boundary line. An important task for us will be to characterize this special class of functions. Example 1.7. Calculate the surface integral of v = 2xzˆx + (x + 2)ˆy + y(z2 − 3)ˆz over five sides (excluding the bottom) of the cubical box (side length 2) in Fig. 1.23. Let “upward and outward” be the positive direction, as indicated by the arrows. Solution. Take the sides one at a time: (i) x = 2, da = dy dz ˆx, v · da = 2xz dy dz = 4zdydz,so ∫ v · da = 4 ∫ 2 0 dy ∫ 2 0 zdz = 16. (ii) x = 0, da = −dy dz ˆx, v · da = −2xz dy dz = 0, so ∫ v · da = 0. (iii) y = 2, da = dx dz ˆy, v · da = (x + 2) dx dz,so ∫ v · da = ∫ 2 0 (x + 2) dx ∫ 2 0 dz = 12. (iv) y = 0, da = −dx dz ˆy, v · da = −(x + 2) dx dz,so ∫ v · da = − ∫ 2 0 (x + 2) dx ∫ 2 0 dz = −12. (v) z = 2, da = dx dy ˆz, v · da = y(z2 − 3) dx dy = ydxdy,so ∫ v · da = ∫ 2 0 dx ∫ 2 0 ydy = 4. 27 1.3 Integral Calculus The total flux is ∫ surface v · da = 16 + 0 + 12 − 12 + 4 = 20. (c) Volume Integrals. A volume integral is an expression of the form ∫ V Tdτ, (1.51) where T is a scalar function and dτ is an infinitesimal volume element. In Cartesian coordinates, dτ = dx dy dz. (1.52) For example, if T is the density of a substance (which might vary from point to point), then the volume integral would give the total mass. Occasionally, we shall encounter volume integrals of vector functions: ∫ v dτ = ∫ (vxˆx + vyˆy + vzˆz) dτ = ˆx ∫ vx dτ + ˆy ∫ vy dτ + ˆz ∫ vz dτ; (1.53) because the unit vectors (ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz) are constants, they come outside the integral. Example 1.8. Calculate the volume integral of T = xyz 2 over the prism in Fig. 1.24. x y z 1 1 3 Fig. 1.24 Solution. You can do the three integrals in any order. Let’s do x first: it runs from 0 to (1 − y), then y (it goes from 0 to 1), and finally z (0 to 3): ∫ Tdτ = ∫ 3 0 z2{∫ 1 0 y[∫ 1−y 0 xdx] dy} dz = 1 2 ∫ 3 0 z2 dz ∫ 1 0 (1 − y)2ydy = 1 2 (9) ( 1 12 ) = 3 8 . 28 1Vector Analysis Problem 1.29. Calculate the line integral of the function v = x2ˆx + 2yzˆy + y2ˆz from the origin to the point (1,1,1) by three different routes: (a) (0, 0, 0) → (1, 0, 0) → (1, 1, 0) → (1, 1, 1). (b) (0, 0, 0) → (0, 0, 1) → (0, 1, 1) → (1, 1, 1). (c) The direct straight line. (d) What is the line integral around the closed loop that goes out along path (a) and back along path (b)? Problem 1.30. Calculate the surface integral of the function in Ex. 1.7,overthe bottom of the box. For consistency, let “upward” be the positive direction. Does the surface integral depend only on the boundary line for this function? What is the total flux over the closed surface of the box (including the bottom)? [Note: For the closed surface, the positive direction is “outward,”and hence “down,”for the bottom face.] Problem 1.31. Calculate the volume integral of the function T = z2 over the tetrahedron with corners at (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0),and (0, 0, 1). 1.3.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Suppose f (x) is a function of one variable. The fundamental theorem of calculus says that ∫ b a ( df dx ) dx = f (b) − f (a). (1.54) In case this doesn’t look familiar, I’ll write it another way: ∫ b a F (x) dx = f (b) − f (a), where df /dx = F (x). The fundamental theorem tells you how to integrate F (x): you think up a function f (x) whose derivative is equal to F. Geometrical Interpretation: According to Eq. 1.33, df = (df /dx) dx is the infinitesimal change in f when yougofrom (x) to (x+dx). The fundamental theorem (Eq. 1.54) says that if you chop the interval from a to b (Fig. 1.25) into many tiny pieces, dx, and add up the increments df from each little piece, the result is (not surprisingly) equal to the total change in f : f (b) − f (a). In other words, there are two ways to determine the total change in the function: either subtract the values at the ends or go step by step, adding up all the tiny increments as you go. You’ll get the same answer either way. Notice the structure of the fundamental theorem: the integral of a derivative over some region is given by the value of the function at the end points (boundaries). In vector calculus there are three species of derivative (gradient, divergence, and curl), and each has its own “fundamental theo- rem,” with essentially the same format. I don’t plan to prove these theorems 29 1.3 Integral Calculus xbdxa f (x) f (b) f (a) Fig. 1.25 dl1 y z x a b Fig. 1.26 here; rather, I will explain what they mean, and try to make them plausible. Proofs are given in Appendix A. 1.3.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Gradients Suppose we have a scalar function of three variables T (x, y, z). Starting at point a, we move a small distance dl1 (Fig. 1.26). According to Eq. 1.37, the function T will change by an amount dT = (∇T ) · dl1. Now we move a little farther, by an additional small displacement dl2;the incremental change in T will be (∇T ) · dl2. In this manner, proceeding by infinitesimal steps, we make the journey to point b. At each step we compute the gradient of T (at that point) and dot it into the displacement dl … this gives us the change in T. Evidently, the total change in T in going from a to b (along the path selected) is ∫ b a (∇T ) · dl = T (b) − T (a). (1.55) This is the fundamental theorem for gradients; like the “ordinary” funda- mental theorem, it says that the integral (here a line integral) of a derivative (here the gradient) is given by the value of the function at the boundaries (a and b). Geometrical Interpretation: Suppose you wanted to determine the height of the Eiffel Tower. You could climb the stairs, using a ruler to measure the rise at each step, and adding them all up (that’s the left-hand side of Eq. 1.55), or you could place altimeters at the top and the bottom, and subtract the two readings (that’s the right-hand side); you should get the same answer either way (that’s the fundamental theorem). Incidentally, as we found in Ex. 1.6, line integrals ordinarily depend on the path taken from a to b. But the right-hand side of Eq. 1.55 makes no reference to the path – only to the end points! Evidently, gradients have the special property that their line integrals are path independent: 30 1Vector Analysis Corollary 1. The integral ∫ b a (∇T ) · dl is independent of the path taken from a to b. Corollary 2. The integral ∮ (∇T ) · dl = 0, since the beginning and end points are identical, and hence T (b) − T (a) = 0. Example 1.9. Let T = xy 2, and take point a to be the origin (0, 0, 0) and b the point (2, 1, 0). Check the fundamental theorem for gradients. x y (iii) (i) 1 1 a b 2 (ii) Fig. 1.27 Solution. Although the integral is independent of path, we must pick a specific path in order to evaluate it. Let’s go out along the x-axis (step i) and then up (step ii) (Fig. 1.27). As always, dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz; ∇T = y 2ˆx + 2xyˆy. (i) y = 0, dl = dx ˆx, ∇T · dl = y 2 dx = 0, so ∫ (i) ∇T · dl = 0. (ii) x = 2, dl = dy ˆy, ∇T · dl = 2xy dy = 4ydy,so ∫ (ii) ∇T · dl = ∫ 1 0 4ydy = 2y 2|| 1 0 = 2. The total line integral is 2. Is this consistent with the fundamental theorem? Yes: T (b) − T (a) = 2 − 0 = 2. Now, just to convince you that the answer is independent of path, let me calculate the same integral along path (iii) (the straight line from a to b): (iii) y = 1 2 x, dy = 1 2 dx, ∇T · dl = y 2 dx + 2xy dy = 3 4 x 2 dx,so ∫ (iii) ∇T · dl = ∫ 2 0 3 4 x 2 dx = 1 4 x 3||| 2 0 = 2. ✓ Problem 1.32. Check the fundamental theorem for gradients, using T = x2 +4xy+2yz3, the points a = (0, 0, 0), b = (1, 1, 1), and the three paths in Fig. 1.28: (a) (0, 0, 0) → (1, 0, 0) → (1, 1, 0) → (1, 1, 1); (b) (0, 0, 0) → (0, 0, 1) → (0, 1, 1) → (1, 1, 1); (c) the parabolic path z = x2, y = x. 31 1.3 Integral Calculus y z (a)x y z (b)x y z (c)x Fig. 1.28 1.3.4 The Fundamental Theorem for Divergences The fundamental theorem for divergences states that ∫ V(∇ · v) dτ = ∮ S v · da. (1.56) In honor, I suppose, of its great importance, this theorem has at least three different names: Gauss’s theorem, Green’s theorem, or simply the divergence theorem. Like the other “fundamental theorems,” it says that the integral of a derivative (in this case the divergence)overa region (in this case a volume, V) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary (in this case the surface S that bounds the volume). Notice that the boundary term is itself an integral (specifically, a surface integral). This is reasonable: the “boundary” of a line is just two end points, but the boundary of a volume is a (closed) surface. Geometrical Interpretation: If v represents the flow of an incompressible fluid, then the flux of v (the right-hand side of Eq. 1.56) is the total amount of stuff passing out through the surface, per unit time. Now, the divergence measures the “spreading out” of the vectors from a point – a place of high divergence is like a “faucet,” pouring out liquid. If we have a bunch of faucets in a region completely filled with incompressible fluid, an equal amount of liquid will be forced out through the boundaries of the region. In fact, there are two ways we could determine how much is being produced: (a) we could count up all the faucets, recording how much each puts out, or (b) we could go around the boundary, measuring the outflow at each point, and add it all up. You get the same answer either way: ∫ (faucets within the volume) = ∮ (flow out through the surface). This, in essence, is what the divergence theorem says. Example 1.10. Check the divergence theorem using the function v = y 2ˆx + (2xy + z2)ˆy + (2yz)ˆz and a unit cube at the origin (Fig. 1.29). 32 1Vector Analysis x y z (iii) (ii) (i) (v) (vi) (iv) 1 1 1 Fig. 1.29 Solution. In this case, ∇ · v = 2(x + y) and ∫ V 2(x + y) dτ = 2 ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 (x + y) dx dy dz, ∫ 1 0 (x + y) dx = 1 2 + y, ∫ 1 0 ( 1 2 + y) dy = 1, ∫ 1 0 1 dz = 1. Thus, ∫ V ∇ · v dτ = 2. So much for the left-hand side of the divergence theorem. To evaluate the surface integral we must consider separately the six faces of the cube: (i) ∫ v · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 y 2 dy dz = 1 3 . (ii) ∫ v · da = − ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 y 2 dy dz = − 1 3 . (iii) ∫ v · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 (2x + z2) dx dz = 4 3 . (iv) ∫ v · da = − ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 z2 dx dz = − 1 3 . (v) ∫ v · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 2ydxdy = 1. (vi) ∫ v · da = − ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 0 dx dy = 0. So the total flux is ∮ S v · da = 1 3 − 1 3 + 4 3 − 1 3 + 1 + 0 = 2, as expected. 33 1.3 Integral Calculus Problem 1.33. Test the divergence theorem for the function v = (xy)ˆx+(2yz)ˆy+(3zx)ˆz. Take as your volume the cube shown in Fig. 1.30, with sides of length 2. x y z 2 2 2 Fig. 1.30 1.3.5 The Fundamental Theorem for Curls The fundamental theorem for curls, which goes by the special name of Stokes’ theorem, states that ∫ S(∇ × v) · da = ∮ P v · dl. (1.57) As always, the integral of a derivative (here, the curl)overa region (here, a patch of surface, S) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary (here, the perimeter of the patch, P). As in the case of the divergence theorem, the boundary term is itself an integral – specifically, a closed line integral. Geometrical Interpretation: Recall that the curl measures the “twist” of the vectors v; a region of high curl is a whirlpool – if you put a tiny paddle wheel there, it will rotate. Now, the integral of the curl over some surface (or, more precisely, the flux of the curl through that surface) represents the “total amount of swirl,” and we can determine that just as well by going around the edge and finding how much the flow is following the boundary (Fig. 1.31). Indeed, ∮ v · dl is sometimes called the circulation of v. You may have noticed an apparent ambiguity in Stokes’ theorem: con- cerning the boundary line integral, which way are we supposed to go around (clockwise or counterclockwise)? If we go the “wrong” way, we’ll pick up an overall sign error. The answer is that it doesn’t matter which way you go as long as you are consistent, for there is a compensating sign ambiguity in the surface integral: Which way does da point? For a closed surface (as in the divergence theorem), da points in the direction of the outward normal; but for an open surface, which way is “out”? Consistency in Stokes’ theorem (as in all such matters) is given by the right-hand rule: if your fingers point in the direction of the line integral, then your thumb fixes the direction of da (Fig. 1.32). 34 1Vector Analysis = Fig. 1.31 da d l Fig. 1.32 Now, there are plenty of surfaces (infinitely many) that share any given boundary line. Twist a paper clip into a loop, and dip it in soapy water. The soap film constitutes a surface, with the wire loop as its boundary. If you blow on it, the soap film will expand, making a larger surface, with the same boundary. Ordinarily, a flux integral depends critically on what surface you integrate over, but evidently this is not the case with curls. For Stokes’ theo- rem says that ∫ (∇×v)·da is equal to the line integral of v around the bound- ary, and the latter makes no reference to the specific surface you choose. Corollary 1. The integral ∫ (∇ × v) · da depends only on the boundary line, not on the particular surface used. Corollary 2. The integral ∮ (∇ × v) · da = 0 for any closed surface, since the boundary line, like the mouth of a balloon, shrinks down to a point, and hence the right-hand side of Eq. 1.57 vanishes. These corollaries are analogous to the ones for the gradient theorem. We will develop the parallel further in due course. Example 1.11. Suppose v = (2xz + 3y 2)ˆy + (4yz 2)ˆz. Check Stokes’ theorem for the square surface shown in Fig. 1.33. Solution. Here, ∇ × v = (4z 2 − 2x)ˆx + 2zˆz and da = dy dz ˆx. (In saying that da points in the x direction, we are committing our- selves to a counterclockwise line integral. We could as well write da = −dy dz ˆx, but then we would be obliged to go clockwise.) Since x = 0 for this surface, ∫ (∇ × v) · da = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 1 0 4z 2 dy dz = 4 3 . Now, what about the line integral? We must break this up into four segments: (i) x = 0, z = 0, v · dl = 3y 2 dy, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 1 0 3y 2 dy = 1; (ii) x = 0, y = 1, v · dl = 4z2 dz, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 1 0 4z 2 dz = 4 3 ; (iii) x = 0, z = 1, v · dl = 3y 2 dy, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 0 1 3y 2 dy = −1; (iv) x = 0, y = 0, v · dl = 0, ∫ v · dl = ∫ 0 1 0 dz = 0. 35 1.3 Integral Calculus So ∮ v · dl = 1 + 4 3 − 1 + 0 = 4 3 . It checks. A point of strategy: notice how I handled step (iii). There is a temptation to write dl = −dy ˆy here, since the path goes to the left. You can get away with this, if you absolutely insist, by running the integral from 0 → 1.Butitismuchsafer tosay dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz always (never any minus signs) and let the limits of the integral take care of the direction. x y z 1 1 (iv) (ii) (iii) (i) Fig. 1.33 Problem 1.34. Test Stokes’theorem for the function v = (xy)ˆx+ (2yz)ˆy+ (3zx)ˆz, using the triangular shaded area of Fig. 1.34. Problem 1.35. Check Corollary 1 by using the same function and boundary line as in Ex. 1.11, but integrating over the five faces of the cube in Fig. 1.35. The back of the cube is open. x y z 2 2 Fig. 1.34 x y z (iii)(i) (v) (iv) (ii) 1 1 1 Fig. 1.35 1.3.6 Integration by Parts The technique known (awkwardly) as integration by parts exploits the product rule for derivatives: d dx (fg) = f ( dg dx ) + g( df dx ). 36 1Vector Analysis Integrating both sides, and invoking the fundamental theorem, ∫ b a d dx (fg) dx = fg||b a = ∫ b a f ( dg dx ) dx + ∫ b a g( df dx ) dx, or ∫ b a f ( dg dx ) dx = − ∫ b a g( df dx ) dx + fg||b a. (1.58) That’s integration by parts. It applies to the situation in which you are called upon to integrate the product of one function (f ) and the derivative of another (g); it says you can transfer the derivative from g to f ,atthe cost of a minus sign and a boundary term. Example 1.12. Evaluate the integral ∫ ∞ 0 xe−x dx. Solution. The exponential can be expressed as a derivative: e−x = d dx (−e−x). In this case, then, f (x) = x, g(x) = −e−x,and df /dx = 1, so ∫ ∞ 0 xe−x dx = ∫ ∞ 0 e−x dx − xe−x|||| ∞ 0 = −e−x|| ∞ 0 = 1. We can exploit the product rules of vector calculus, together with the appropriate fundamental theorems, in exactly the same way. For example, integrating ∇ · (f A) = f (∇ · A) + A · (∇f ) over a volume, and invoking the divergence theorem, yields ∫ V ∇ · (f A) dτ = ∫ V f (∇ · A) dτ + ∫ V A · (∇f ) dτ = ∮ S f A · da, or ∫ V f (∇ · A) dτ = − ∫ V A · (∇f ) dτ + ∮ S f A · da. (1.59) Here again the integrand is the product of one function (f ) and the derivative (in this case the divergence) of another (A), and integration by parts allows us to transfer the derivative from A to f (where it becomes a gradient), at the cost of a minus sign and a boundary term (in this case a surface integral). You might wonder how often one is likely to encounter an integral involving the product of one function and the derivative of another. The answer is … surprisingly often! And integration by parts turns out to be one of the most powerful tools in vector calculus. 37 1.4 Curvilinear Coordinates Problem 1.36. (a) Show that ∫ S f (∇ × A) · da = ∫ S[A × (∇f )] · da + ∮ P f A · dl. (1.60) (b) Show that ∫ V B · (∇ × A) dτ = ∫ V A · (∇ × B) dτ + ∮ S(A × B) · da. (1.61) 1.4 Curvilinear Coordinates 1.4.1 Spherical Coordinates You can label a point P by its Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), but sometimes it is more convenient to use spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ); r is the distance from the origin (the magnitude of the position vector r), θ (the angle down from the z-axis) is called the polar angle,and φ (the angle around from the x-axis) is the azimuthal angle. Their relation to Cartesian coordinates can be read from Fig. 1.36: x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ, z = r cos θ. (1.62) Figure 1.36 also shows three unit vectors, ˆr, ˆθ, ˆφ, pointing in the direction of increase of the corresponding coordinates. They constitute an orthogonal (mutually perpendicular) basis set (just like ˆx, ˆy, ˆz), and any vector A can be expressed in terms of them, in the usual way: A = Arˆr + Aθ ˆθ + Aφ ˆφ; (1.63) where Ar, Aθ,and Aφ are the radial, polar, and azimuthal components of A. In terms of the Cartesian unit vectors, x y z r r P θ φ θ φˆ ˆ ˆ Fig. 1.36 38 1Vector Analysis x y z AB 1\u00021 Fig. 1.37 ˆr = sin θ cos φ ˆx + sin θ sin φ ˆy + cos θ ˆz, ˆθ = cos θ cos φ ˆx + cos θ sin φ ˆy − sin θ ˆz, ˆφ = − sin φ ˆx + cos φ ˆy, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (1.64) as you can check for yourself (Prob. 1.38). I have put these formulas inside the back cover, for easy reference. But there is a poisonous snake lurking here that I’d better warn you about: ˆr, ˆθ,and ˆφ are associated with a particular point P,and they change direction as P moves around. For example, ˆr always points radially outward, but “radially outward” can be the x direction, the y direction, or any other direction, depending on where you are. In Fig. 1.37, A = ˆy and B = −ˆy,and yet both of them would be written as ˆr in spherical coordinates. One could take account of this by explicitly indicating the point of reference: ˆr(θ, φ), ˆθ(θ, φ), ˆφ(θ, φ), but this would be cumbersome, and as long as you are alert to the problem, I don’t think it will cause difficulties.9 In particular, do not naïvely combine the spherical components of vectors associated with different points (in Fig. 1.37, A + B = 0, not 2ˆr,and A · B = −1, not +1). Beware of differentiating a vector that is expressed in spherical coordinates, since the unit vectors themselves are functions of position (∂ˆr/∂θ = ˆθ, for example). And do not take ˆr, ˆθ, and ˆφ outside an integral, as I did with ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz in Eq. 1.53. In general, if you’re uncertain about the validity of an operation, express everything in Cartesian coordinates; they are snakeproof. An infinitesimal displacement in the ˆr direction is simply dr (Fig. 1.38a), just as an infinitesimal element of length in the x direction is dx: dlr = dr. (1.65) On the other hand, an infinitesimal element of length in the ˆθ direction (Fig. 1.38b)is not just dθ (that’s an angle – it doesn’t even have the right units for a length); rather, dlθ = rdθ. (1.66) Similarly, an infinitesimal element of length in the ˆφ direction (Fig. 1.38c)is dlφ = r sin θ dφ. (1.67) 9 I claimed back at the beginning that vectors have no location, and I’ll stand by that. The vectors themselves live “out there,” completely independent of our choice of coordinates. But the notation we use to represent them does depend on the point in question, in curvilinear coordinates; ˆr, ˆθ,and ˆφ stand for different vectors at different locations. 39 1.4 Curvilinear Coordinates dr r (a) r rdθ dθ (b) (c) r sin θ\u0003dφ r sin θ r dφ θ Fig. 1.38 x y z da2 da1 Fig. 1.39 Thus the general infinitesimal displacement dl is dl = dr ˆr + rdθ ˆθ + r sin θ dφ ˆφ. (1.68) This plays the role (in line integrals, for example) that dl = dx ˆx + dy ˆy + dz ˆz played in Cartesian coordinates. The infinitesimal volume element dτ, in spherical coordinates, is the product of the three infinitesimal displacements: dτ = dlr dlθ dlφ = r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ. (1.69) I cannot give you a general expression for surface elements da, since these depend on the orientation of the surface. You simply have to analyze the geometry for any given case (this goes for Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates alike). If you are integrating over the surface of a sphere, for instance, then r is constant, whereas θ and φ change (Fig. 1.39), so da1 = dlθ dlφ ˆr = r 2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr. On the other hand, if the surface lies in the xy plane, say, so that θ is constant (to wit, π/2) while r and φ vary, then da2 = dlr dlφ ˆθ = rdrdφ ˆθ. Notice, finally, that r ranges from 0 to ∞, φ from 0 to 2π,and θ from 0 to π (not 2π – that would count every point twice).10 10 Alternatively, you could run φ from 0 to π (the “eastern hemisphere”) and cover the “western hemisphere” by extending θ from π up to 2π. But this is very bad notation, since, among other things, sin θ will then run negative, and you’ll have to put absolute value signs around that term in volume and surface elements (area and volume being intrinsically positive quantities). 40 1Vector Analysis Example 1.13. Find the volume of a sphere of radius R. Solution. V = ∫ dτ = ∫ R r=0 ∫ π θ=0 ∫ 2π φ=0 r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ = (∫ R 0 r 2 dr)(∫ π 0 sin θ dθ)(∫ 2π 0 dφ) = ( R3 3 ) (2)(2π) = 4 3 πR3 (not a big surprise). So far we have talked only about the geometry of spherical coordinates. Now I would like to “translate” the vector derivatives (gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian) into r, θ, φ notation. In principle, this is entirely straightforward: in the case of the gradient, ∇T = ∂T ∂x ˆx + ∂T ∂y ˆy + ∂T ∂z ˆz, we would first use the chain rule to expand the partials: ∂T ∂x = ∂T ∂r ( ∂r ∂x ) + ∂T ∂θ ( ∂θ ∂x ) + ∂T ∂φ ( ∂φ ∂x ). The terms in parentheses could be worked out from Eq. 1.62 –orrather, the inverse of those equations (Prob. 1.37). Then we’d do thesamefor ∂T/∂y and ∂T/∂z. Finally, we’d substitute in the formulas for ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz in terms of ˆr, ˆθ,and ˆφ (Prob. 1.38). It would take an hour to figure out the gradient in spherical coordinates by this brute-force method. I suppose this is how it was first done, but there is a much more efficient indirect approach, explained in Appendix A, which has the extra advantage of treating all coordinate systems at once. I described the “straightforward” method only to convince you that there is nothing subtle or mysteri- ous about transforming to spherical coordinates: you’re expressing the same quantity (gradient, divergence, or whatever) in different notation, that’s all. Here, then, are the vector derivatives in spherical coordinates: Gradient: ∇T = ∂T ∂r ˆr + 1 r ∂T ∂θ ˆθ + 1 r sin θ ∂T ∂φ ˆφ. (1.70) Divergence: ∇ · v = 1 r2 ∂ ∂r (r 2vr) + 1 r sin θ ∂ ∂θ (sin θ vθ) + 1 r sin θ ∂vφ ∂φ .

Notice that φ has the same meaning as in spherical coordinates, and z is the same as Cartesian; s is the distance to P from the z-axis,whereas the spherical coordinate r is the distance from the origin. The relation to Cartesian coordinates is x = s cos φ, y = s sin φ, z = z.

(1.83) At every location, v is directed radially outward (Fig. 1.44); if ever there was a function that ought to have a large positive divergence, this is it. And yet, when you actually calculate the divergence (using Eq. 1.71), you get precisely zero: ∇ · v = 1 r2 ∂ ∂r (r 2 1 r2 ) = 1 r2 ∂ ∂r (1) = 0. (1.84) 44 1Vector Analysis Fig. 1.44 Or you can do it in Cartesian coordinates (as in Prob. 1.16). The plot thickens when we apply the divergence theorem to this function. Suppose we integrate over a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin (Prob. 1.39b); the surface integral is ∮ v · da = ∫ ( 1 R2 ˆr) · (R2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr) = (∫ π 0 sin θ dθ)(∫ 2π 0 dφ) = 4π. (1.85) But the volume integral, ∫ ∇·v dτ,is zero, if we are really to believe Eq. 1.84. Does this mean that the divergence theorem is false? What’s going on here? The source of the problem is the point r = 0, where v blows up (and where, in Eq. 1.84, we have unwittingly divided by zero). It is quite true that ∇ · v = 0everywhere except the origin, but right at the origin the situation is more complicated. Notice that the surface integral (Eq. 1.85) is independent of R; if the divergence theorem is right (and it is), we should get ∫ (∇ · v) dτ = 4π for any sphere centered at the origin, no matter how small. Evidently, the entire contribution must be coming from the point r = 0! Thus, ∇ · v has the bizarre property that it vanishes everywhere except at one point, and yet its integral (over any volume containing that point) is 4π. No ordinary function behaves like that. (On the other hand, a physical example does come to mind: the density – mass per unit volume – of a point particle. It’s zero except at the exact location of the particle, and yet its integral is finite – namely, the mass of the particle.) What we have stumbled on is a mathematical object known to physicists as the Dirac delta function. It arises in many branches of theoretical physics. Moreover, the specific problem at hand (the divergence of the function ˆr/r 2) is not just some arcane curiosity – it is, in fact, central to the whole theory of electrodynamics. So it is worthwhile pausing here and studying the Dirac delta function with some care. 1.5.2 The One-Dimensional Dirac Delta Function The one-dimensional Dirac delta function, δ(x), can be pictured as an infinitely high, infinitesimally narrow “spike,” with area 1 (Fig. 1.45). That is to say, 45 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function x δ(x) Area 1 0 Fig. 1.45 x R2(x) R1(x) 1 2 \u00021/2 \u00021/4 \u00021/21/4 1/2 1/2 1 (a) x T2(x) 1 2 \u00021 T1(x) (b) Fig. 1.46 δ(x) = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0if x \u0002 0, ∞ if x = 0, (1.86) and11 ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x) dx = 1. (1.87) Technically, δ(x) is not a function at all, since its value is not finite at x = 0; in the mathematical literature it is known as a generalized function,or distribution. It is, if you like, the limit of a sequence of functions, such as rectangles Rn(x),of height n and width 1/n, or isosceles triangles Tn(x),of height n and base 2/n (Fig. 1.46). If f (x) is some “ordinary” function (that is, not another delta function – in fact, just to be on the safe side, let’s say that f (x) is continuous), then the product f (x)δ(x) is zero everywhere except at x = 0. It follows that f (x)δ(x) = f (0)δ(x). (1.88) (This is the most important fact about the delta function, so make sure you understand why it is true: since the product is zero anyway except at x = 0, we may as well replace f (x) by the value it assumes at the origin.) In particular, ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(x) dx = f (0) ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x) dx = f (0). (1.89) 11 Notice that the dimensions of δ(x) are 1 over the dimensions of its argument; if x is a length, δ(x) carries the units m−1. 46 1Vector Analysis xa δ(x \u0002 a) Area 1 Fig. 1.47 Under an integral, then, the delta function “picks out” the value of f (x) at x = 0. (Here and below, the integral need not run from −∞ to +∞;it is sufficient that it straddle the delta function, and −ϵ to +ϵ would do as well.) Of course, we can shift the spike from x = 0 to some other point, x = a (Fig. 1.47): δ(x − a) = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0if x \u0002 a, ∞ if x = a, with ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x − a) dx = 1. (1.90) Equation 1.88 becomes f (x)δ(x − a) = f (a)δ(x − a), (1.91) and Eq. 1.89 generalizes to ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(x − a) dx = f (a). (1.92) Example 1.14. Evaluate the integral ∫ 3 0 x 3δ(x − 2) dx. Solution. The delta function picks out the value of x 3 at the point x = 2, so the integral is 23 = 8. Notice, however, that if the upper limit had been 1 (instead of 3), the answer would be 0, because the spike would then be outside the domain of integration. Although δ itself is not a legitimate function, integrals over δ are per- fectly acceptable. In fact, it’s best to think of the delta function as something that is always intended for use under an integral sign. In particular, two 47 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function expressions involving delta functions (say, D1(x) and D2(x)) are considered equal if 12 ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)D1(x) dx = ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)D2(x) dx (1.93) for all (“ordinary”) functions f (x). Example 1.15. Show that δ(kx) = 1 |k| δ(x), (1.94) where k is any (nonzero) constant. (In particular, δ(−x) = δ(x):it’san even function.) Solution. For an arbitrary test function f (x), consider the integral ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(kx) dx. Changing variables, we let y ≡ kx,sothat x = y/k,and dx = (1/k) dy. If k is positive, the integration still runs from −∞ to +∞, but if k is negative, then x = ∞ implies y = −∞, and vice versa, so the order of the limits is reversed. Restoring the “proper” order costs a minus sign. Thus ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(kx) dx = ± ∫ ∞ −∞ f (y/k)δ(y) dy k = ± 1 k f (0) = 1 |k| f (0). (The lower signs apply when k is negative, and we account for this neatly by putting absolute value bars around the final k, as indicated.) Under the integral sign, then, δ(kx) serves the same purpose as (1/|k|)δ(x): ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)δ(kx) dx = ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x) [ 1 |k| δ(x)] dx. According to the criterion Eq. 1.93, therefore, δ(kx) and (1/|k|)δ(x) are equal. Problem 1.44. Evaluate the following integrals: (a) ∫ 6 2 (3x2 − 2x − 1)δ(x − 3) dx. (b) ∫ 5 0 cos xδ(x − π) dx. (c) ∫ 3 0 x3δ(x + 1) dx. (d) ∫ ∞ −∞ ln(x + 3)δ(x + 2) dx. 12 I emphasize that the integrals must be equal for any f (x). Suppose D1 (x) and D2 (x) actually differed, say, in the neighborhood of the point x = 17. Then we could pick a function f (x) that was sharply peaked about x = 17, and the integrals would not be equal. 48 1Vector Analysis Problem 1.45. Evaluate the following integrals: (a) ∫ 2 −2(2x + 3)δ(3x) dx. (b) ∫ 2 0 (x3 + 3x + 2)δ(1 − x) dx. (c) ∫ 1 −1 9x2δ(3x + 1) dx. (d) ∫ a −∞ δ(x − b) dx. Problem 1.46. (a) Show that x d dx (δ(x)) = −δ(x). [Hint: Use integration by parts.] (b) Let θ(x) be the (Heaviside) step function: θ(x) ≡ ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪ ⎩ 1 if x > 0, 0 if x ≤ 0. (1.95) Show that dθ/dx = δ(x). 1.5.3 The Three-Dimensional Delta Function It is easy to generalize the delta function to three dimensions: δ3(r) = δ(x) δ(y) δ(z). (1.96) (As always, r ≡ xˆx + yˆy + zˆz is the position vector, extending from the origin to the point (x, y, z).) This three-dimensional delta function is zero everywhere except at (0, 0, 0), where it blows up. Its volume integral is 1: ∫ all space δ3(r) dτ = ∫ ∞ −∞ ∫ ∞ −∞ ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(x) δ(y) δ(z) dx dy dz = 1. (1.97) And, generalizing Eq. 1.92, ∫ all space f (r)δ3(r − a) dτ = f (a). (1.98) As in the one-dimensional case, integration with δ picks out the value of the function f at the location of the spike. We are now in a position to resolve the paradox introduced in Section 1.5.1. As you will recall, we found that the divergence of ˆr/r2 is zero everywhere except at the origin, and yet its integral over any volume containing the origin is a constant (to wit, 4π). These are precisely the defining conditions for the Dirac delta function; evidently, ∇ · ( ˆr r2 ) = 4πδ3(r). (1.99) 49 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function More generally, ∇ · ( ˆ 2 ) = 4πδ3( ), (1.100) where, as always, is the separation vector: ≡ r − r′. Note that differenti- ation here is with respect to r, while r′ is held constant. Incidentally, since ∇( 1 ) = − ˆ 2 (1.101) (Prob. 1.13b), it follows that ∇2 1 = −4πδ3( ). (1.102) Example 1.16. Evaluate the integral J = ∫ V(r 2 + 2) ∇ · ( ˆr r2 ) dτ, where V is a sphere13 of radius R centered at the origin. Solution 1. Use Eq. 1.99 to rewrite the divergence, and Eq. 1.98 to do the integral: J = ∫ V(r 2 + 2)4πδ3(r) dτ = 4π(0 + 2) = 8π. This one-line solution demonstrates something of the power and beauty of the delta function, but I would like to show you a second method, which is much more cumbersome but serves to illustrate the method of integration by parts (Section 1.3.6). Solution 2. Using Eq. 1.59, we transfer the derivative from ˆr/r2 to (r 2 + 2): J = − ∫ V ˆr r2 · [∇(r 2 + 2)] dτ + ∮ S(r 2 + 2) ˆr r2 · da. The gradient is ∇(r 2 + 2) = 2rˆr, so the volume integral becomes ∫ 2 r dτ = ∫ 2 r r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ = 8π ∫ R 0 rdr = 4πR2. Meanwhile, on the boundary of the sphere (where r = R), da = R2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr, 13 In proper mathematical jargon, “sphere” denotes the surface, and “ball” the volume it encloses. But physicists are (as usual) sloppy about this sort of thing, and I use the word “sphere” for both the surface and the volume. Where the meaning is not clear from the context, I will write “spherical surface” or “spherical volume.” The language police tell me that the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron, but a poll of my physics colleagues reveals that this is (for us) the standard usage. 50 1Vector Analysis so the surface integral is ∫ (R2 + 2) sin θ dθ dφ = 4π(R2 + 2). Putting it all together, J = −4πR2 + 4π(R2 + 2) = 8π, as before. Problem 1.47. (a) Write an expression for the volume charge density ρ(r) of a point charge q at r′.Make sure that the volume integral of ρ equals q. (b) What is the volume charge density of an electric dipole, consisting of a point charge −q at the origin and a point charge +q at a? (c) What is the volume charge density (in spherical coordinates) of a uniform, infinitesimally thin spherical shell of radius R and total charge Q, centered at the origin? [Beware: The integral over all space must equal Q.] Problem 1.48. Evaluate the following integrals: (a) ∫ (r2 + r · a + a2)δ3(r − a) dτ,where a is a fixed vector, a is its magnitude, and the integral is over all space. (b) ∫ V |r − b|2δ3(5r) dτ,where V is a cube of side length 2, centered on the origin, and b = 4ˆy + 3ˆz. (c) ∫ V[r4 + r2(r · c) + c4]δ3(r − c) dτ,where V is a sphere of radius 6 about the origin, c = 5ˆx + 3ˆy + 2ˆz,and c is its magnitude. (d) ∫ V r · (d − r)δ3(e − r) dτ,where d = (1, 2, 3), e = (3, 2, 1),and V is a sphere of radius 1.5 centered at (2, 2, 2). Problem 1.49. Evaluate the integral J = ∫ V e−r (∇ · ˆr r2 ) dτ (where V is a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin) by two different methods, as in Ex. 1.16. 1.6 The Theory of Vector Fields This section anticipates issues that will arise in later chapters. I include it here for completeness, and to help you distinguish purely mathematical considerations from the physical context in which they occur. Read it now to get a sense of the “lay of the land,” and refer back to it as needed. 51 1.6 The Theory of Vector Fields 1.6.1 The Helmholtz Theorem Ever since Faraday, the laws of electricity and magnetism have been expressed in terms of electric and magnetic fields, E and B. Like many physical laws, these are most compactly expressed as differential equations. Since E and B are vectors, the differential equations naturally involve vector derivatives: divergence and curl. Indeed, Maxwell reduced the entire theory to four equations, specifying respectively the divergence and the curl of E and B. Maxwell’s formulation raises an important mathematical question: To what extent is a vector function determined by its divergence and curl? In other words, if I tell you that the divergence of F (which stands for E or B, as the case may be) is a specified (scalar) function D, ∇ · F = D, and the curl of F is a specified (vector) function C, ∇ × F = C (for consistency, C must be divergenceless, ∇ · C = 0, because the divergence of a curl is always zero), can you then determine the function F? Well … not quite. For example, as you may have discovered in Prob. 1.20, there are many functions whose divergence and curl are both zero every- where–thetrivial case F = 0, of course, but also F = yzˆx + zxˆy + xyˆz, F = sin x cosh y ˆx − cos x sinh y ˆy, etc. To solve a differential equation you must also be supplied with appropriate boundary conditions. In electrodynamics we typically require that the fields go to zero “at infinity” (far away from all charges).14 With that extra information, the Helmholtz theorem guarantees that the field is uniquely determined by its divergence and curl. (The Helmholtz theorem is discussed in Appendix B.) 1.6.2 Potentials If the curl of a vector field (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential (V ): ∇ × F = 0 ⇔ F = −∇V . (1.103) (The minus sign is purely conventional.) That’s the essential burden of the following theorem: 14 In some textbook problems, the charge itself extends to infinity (we speak, for instance, of the electric field of an infinite plane, or the magnetic field of an infinite wire). In such cases the normal boundary conditions do not apply, and one must invoke symmetry arguments to determine the fields uniquely. 52 1Vector Analysis Theorem 1. Curl-less (or “irrotational”) fields. The following condi- tions are equivalent (that is, F satisfies one if and only if it satisfies all the others): (a) ∇ × F = 0 everywhere. (b) ∫ b a F · dl is independent of path, for any given end points. (c) ∮ F · dl = 0 for any closed loop. (d) F is the gradient of some scalar function: F = −∇V . The potential is not unique – any constant can be added to V with impunity, since this will not affect its gradient. If the divergence of a vector field (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be expressed as the curl of a vector potential (A): ∇ · F = 0 ⇔ F = ∇ × A. (1.104) That’s the main conclusion of the following theorem: Theorem 2. Divergenceless (or “solenoidal”) fields. The following con- ditions are equivalent: (a) ∇ · F = 0everywhere. (b) ∫ F · da is independent of surface, for any given boundary line. (c) ∮ F · da = 0 for any closed surface. (d) F is the curl of some vector function: F = ∇ × A. The vector potential is not unique – the gradient of any scalar function can be added to A without affecting the curl, since the curl of a gradient is zero. You should by now be able to prove all the connections in these theorems, save for the ones that say (a), (b), or (c) implies (d). Those are more subtle, and will come later. Incidentally, in all cases (whatever its curl and divergence may be) a vector field F can be written as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a vector:15 F = −∇V + ∇ × A (always). (1.105) Problem 1.50. (a) Let F1 = x2ˆz and F2 = xˆx + yˆy + zˆz. Calculate the divergence and curl of F1 and F2. Which one can be written as the gradient of a scalar? Find a scalar potential that does the job. Which one can be written as the curl of a vector? Find a suitable vector potential. (b) Show that F3 = yzˆx + zxˆy + xyˆz can be written both as the gradient of a scalar and as the curl of a vector. Find scalar and vector potentials for this function. 15 In physics, the word field denotes generically any function of position (x, y, z) and time (t). But in electrodynamics, two particular fields (E and B) are of such paramount importance as to preempt the term. Thus, technically, the potentials are also “fields,” but we never call them that. 53 More Problems on Chapter 1 Problem 1.51. For Theorem 1, show that (d) ⇒ (a), (a) ⇒ (c), (c) ⇒ (b), (b) ⇒ (c), and (c) ⇒ (a). Problem 1.52. For Theorem 2, show that (d) ⇒ (a), (a) ⇒ (c), (c) ⇒ (b), (b) ⇒ (c), and (c) ⇒ (a). Problem 1.53.

(b) Convert A to cylindrical coordinates, and repeat part (a), this time doing everything in terms of s, φ,and z. 2 Electrostatics 2.1 The Electric Field 2.1.1 Introduction The fundamental problem electrodynamics hopes to solve is this (Fig. 2.1): We have some electric charges, q1, q2, q3, ... (call them source charges); what force do they exert on another charge, Q (call it the test charge)? The positions of the source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in motion. The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposi- tion, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can first compute the force F1, due to q1 alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force F2, due to q2 alone; and so on. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: F = F1 + F2 + F3 + ··· . Thus, if we can find the force on Q due to a single source charge q,weare,in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up). 1 Well, at first sight this looks very easy: Why don’t I just write down the formula for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I could, and in Chapter 10 I shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force on Q depend on the separation distance between the charges (Fig. 2.2), it also depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of q. Moreover, it is not the position, velocity, and acceleration of q right now that matter: electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity, and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question (“What is the force on Q due to q?”) is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop 1 The principle of superposition may seem “obvious” to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromagnetic force were proportional to the square of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since (q1 + q2)2 \u0002 q2 1 + q2 2 (there would be “cross terms” to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact. 58 2Electrostatics q2 Q “Source” charges “Test” charge q1 qi Fig. 2.1 Q q Fig. 2.2 will allow for the solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves in quite this simple format. To begin with, we shall consider the special case of electrostatics in which all the source charges are stationary (though the test charge may be moving). 2.1.2 Coulomb’s Law What is the force on a test charge Q due to a single point charge q, that is at rest a distance away? The answer (based on experiments) is given by Coulomb’s law: F = 1 4πϵ0 qQ 2 ˆ. (2.1) The constant ϵ0 is called (ludicrously) the permittivity of free space.InSI units, where force is in newtons (N), distance in meters (m), and charge in coulombs (C), ϵ0 = 8.85 × 10 −12 C 2 N · m2 . In words, the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance. As always (Section 1.1.4), is the separation vector from r′ (the location of q)to r (the location of Q): = r − r′; (2.2) is its magnitude, and ˆ is its direction. The force points along the line from q to Q; it is repulsive if q and Q have the same sign, and attractive if their signs are opposite. Coulomb’s law and the principle of superposition constitute the physical input for electrostatics – the rest, except for some special properties of matter, is mathematical elaboration of these fundamental rules. Problem 2.1. (a) Twelve equal charges, q, are situated at the corners of a regular 12-sided polygon (for instance, one on each numeral of a clock face). What is the net force on a test charge Q at the center? 59 2.1 The Electric Field (b) Suppose one of the 12 qsisremoved (the oneat“6o’clock”).Whatisthe forceon Q?Explain your reasoning carefully. (c) Now 13 equal charges, q, are placed at the corners of a regular 13-sided polygon. What is the force on a test charge Q at the center? (d) If one of the 13 qsisremoved,whatisthe forceon Q? Explain your reasoning. 2.1.3 The Electric Field If we have several point charges q1, q2, ... , qn, at distances 1, 2, ... , n from Q, the total force on Q is evidently F = F1 + F2 + ··· = 1 4πϵ0 ( q1Q 2 1 ˆ1 + q2Q 2 2 ˆ2 + ··· ) = Q 4πϵ0 ( q1 2 1 ˆ1 + q2 2 2 ˆ2 + q3 2 3 ˆ3 + ··· ), or F = QE, (2.3) where E(r) ≡ 1 4πϵ0 n∑ i=1 qi 2 i ˆi. (2.4) The quantity E is called the electric field of the source charges. Notice that it is a function of position (r), because the separation vectors i depend on the location of the field point P (Fig. 2.3). But it makes no reference to the test charge Q. The electric field is a vector quantity that varies from point to point and is determined by the configuration of source charges; physically, E(r) is the force per unit charge that would be exerted on a test charge, if you were to place one at P. What exactly is an electric field? I have deliberately begun with what you might call the “minimal” interpretation of E, as an intermediate step in the calculation of electric forces. But I encourage you to think of the field as a “real” physical entity, filling the space around electric z x y P Source point q1 i rri q2 qi Field point Fig. 2.3 60 2Electrostatics charges. Maxwell himself came to believe that electric and magnetic fields are stresses and strains in an invisible primordial jellylike “ether.” Special relativity has forced us to abandon the notion of ether, and with it Maxwell’s mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic fields. (It is even possible, though cumbersome, to formulate classical electrodynamics as an “action- at-a-distance” theory, and dispense with the field concept altogether.) I can’t tell you, then, what a field is – only how to calculate it and what it can do for you once you’ve got it. Example 2.1. Find the electric field a distance z above the midpoint between two equal charges (q), a distance d apart (Fig. 2.4a). Solution. Let E1 be the field of the left charge alone, and E2 that of the right charge alone (Fig. 2.4b). Adding them (vectorially), the horizontal components cancel and the vertical components conspire: Ez = 2 1 4πϵ0 q 2 cos θ. Here = √z2 + (d/2)2 and cos θ = z/ ,so E = 1 4πϵ0 2qz [z2 + (d/2)2]3/2 ˆz. Check: When z ≫ d you’re so far away that it just looks like a single charge 2q, so the field should reduce to E = (2q/4πϵ0z2)ˆz. And it does (just set d → 0 in the formula). q x z q P z d/2 d/2 d/2d/2 (a) q xq z (b) E2 E1 E Fig. 2.4 Problem 2.2. Find the electric field (magnitude and direction) a distance z above the mid- point between equal and opposite charges (±q), a distance d apart (same as Ex. 2.1,except that the charge at x =+d/2 is −q). 61 2.1 The Electric Field 2.1.4 Continuous Charge Distributions Our definition of the electric field (Eq. 2.4) assumes that the source of the field is a collection of discrete point charges qi. If, instead, the charge is distributed continuously over some region, the sum becomes an integral (Fig. 2.5a): E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 1 2 ˆ dq. (2.5) If the charge is spread out along a line (Fig. 2.5b), with charge-per-unit- length λ, then dq = λ dl′ (where dl′ is an element of length along the line); if the charge is smeared out over a surface (Fig. 2.5c), with charge-per-unit- area σ, then dq = σ da′ (where da′ is an element of area on the surface); and if the charge fills a volume (Fig. 2.5d), with charge-per-unit-volume ρ, then dq = ρ dτ′ (where dτ′ is an element of volume): dq → λ dl′ ∼ σ da′ ∼ ρ dτ′. Thus the electric field of a line charge is E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ λ(r′) 2 ˆ dl′; (2.6) for a surface charge, E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ σ(r′) 2 ˆ da′; (2.7) and for a volume charge, E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′) 2 ˆ dτ′. (2.8) Equation 2.8 itself is often referred to as “Coulomb’s law,” because it is such a short step from the original (Eq. 2.1), and because a volume charge is in some sense the most general and realistic case. Please note carefully P P P dq da dl dτ (a) Continuous distribution (c) Surface charge, σ (d) Volume charge, ρ P (b) Line charge, λ Fig. 2.5 62 2Electrostatics the meaning of in these formulas. Originally, in Eq. 2.4, i stood for the vector from the source charge qi to the field point r. Correspondingly, in Eqs. 2.5–2.8, is the vector from dq (therefore from dl′, da′,or dτ′)tothe field point r. 2 Example 2.2. Find the electric field a distance z above the midpoint of a straight line segment of length 2L that carries a uniform line charge λ (Fig. 2.6). x dx P x z Fig. 2.6 Solution. The simplest method is to chop the line into symmetrically placed pairs (at ±x), quote the result of Ex. 2.1 (with d/2 → x, q → λ dx), and integrate (x :0 → L). But here’s a more general approach: 3 r = zˆz, r′ = xˆx, dl′ = dx; = r − r′ = zˆz − xˆx, = √ z2 + x2, ˆ = = zˆz − xˆx √ z2 + x2 , E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ L −L λ z2 + x2 zˆz − xˆx √z2 + x2 dx = λ 4πϵ0 [zˆz ∫ L −L 1 (z2 + x2)3/2 dx − ˆx ∫ L −L x (z2 + x2)3/2 dx] = λ 4πϵ0 [zˆz( x z2√ z2 + x2 )||| L −L − ˆx(− 1 √ z2 + x2 )||| L −L ] = 1 4πϵ0 2λL z√ z2 + L2 ˆz. For points far from the line (z ≫ L), E ≈ 1 4πϵ0 2λL z2 . 2 Warning: The unit vector ˆ is not constant; its direction depends on the source point r′,and hence it cannot be taken outside the integrals (Eqs. 2.5–2.8). In practice, you must work with Cartesian components (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz are constant, and do come out), even if you use curvilinear coordinates to perform the integration. 3 Ordinarily I’ll put a prime on the source coordinates, but where no confusion is likely to arise I’ll remove the prime to simplify the notation. 63 2.1 The Electric Field This makes sense: From far away the line looks like a point charge q = 2λL. In the limit L →∞, on the other hand, we obtain the field of an infinite straight wire: E = 1 4πϵ0 2λ z . (2.9) Problem 2.3. Find the electric field a distance z above one end of a straight line segment of length L (Fig. 2.7) that carries a uniform line charge λ. Check that your formula is consistent with what you would expect for the case z ≫ L. Problem 2.4. Find the electric field a distance z above the center of a square loop (side length a) carrying a uniform line charge λ (Fig. 2.8). [Hint: Use the result of Ex. 2.2.] Problem 2.5. Find the electric field a distance z above the center of a circular loop of radius r (Fig. 2.9) that carries a uniform line charge λ. Problem 2.6. Find the electric field a distance z above the center of a flat circular disk of radius R (Fig. 2.10) that carries a uniform surface charge σ. What does your formula give in the limit R →∞? Also check the case z ≫ R. P z L Fig. 2.7 P z a Fig. 2.8 P z r Fig. 2.9 P z R Fig. 2.10 x y R P z θ Fig. 2.11 ! Problem 2.7.

Use your result in Prob. 2.7 to find the field inside and outside a solid sphere of radius R that carries a uniform volume charge density ρ. Express your answers in terms of the total charge of the sphere, q.Drawagraphof |E| as a function of the distance from the center. 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss’s Law In principle, we are done with the subject of electrostatics. Equation 2.8 tells us how to compute the field of a charge distribution, and Eq. 2.3 tells us what the force on a charge Q placed in this field will be. Unfortunately, as you may have discovered in working Prob. 2.7, the integrals involved in computing E can be formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of E. I shall calculate the divergence of E directly from Eq. 2.8,in Section 2.2.2, but first I want to show you a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach. Let’s begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge q, situated at the origin: E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 ˆr. (2.10) To get a “feel” for this field, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in Fig. 2.12a. Because the field falls off like 1/r 2, the vectors get shorter as you go farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a nicer way to represent this field, and that’s to connect up the arrows, to form field lines (Fig. 2.12b). You might think that I have thereby thrown away information about the strength of the field, which was contained in the lengths of the arrows. But actually I have not. The magnitude of the field is indicated by the density of the field lines: it’s strong (a) E (b) E Fig. 2.12 65 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields near the center where the field lines are close together, and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart. In truth, the field-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two- dimensional surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius r is the total number divided by the circumference (n/2πr), which goes like (1/r), not (1/r 2).4 But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided by the area of the sphere (n/4πr 2), which does go like (1/r 2). Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated fields. Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how lazy you are (and how sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense of the field, and you must be consistent: if q gets 8 lines, then 2q deserves 16. And you must space them fairly – they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones; they cannot simply terminate in midair,5 though they may extend out to infinity. Moreover, field lines can never cross – at the intersection, the field would have two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the field of any simple configuration of point charges: begin by drawing the lines in the neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to infinity (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14). In this model, the flux of E through a surface S, ΦE ≡ ∫ S E · da, (2.11) is a measure of the “number of field lines” passing through S. I put this in quotes because of course we can only draw a representative sample of the field lines – the total number would be infinite. But for a given sampling Fig. 2.13 4 For a critique of electric field-line diagrams, see A. Wolf et al., Am.J.Phys. 64, 714 (1996). 5 If they did, the divergence of E would not be zero, and (as we shall soon see) that cannot happen in empty space. Of course, in a region with charge density ρ \u0002 0 some field lines will terminate. 66 2Electrostatics ++ Equal charges Fig. 2.14 rate the flux is proportional to the number of lines drawn, because the field strength, remember, is proportional to the density of field lines (the number per unit area), and hence E · da is proportional to the number of lines passing through the infinitesimal area da. (The dot product picks out the component of da along the direction of E, as indicated in Fig. 2.15.Itis the area in the plane perpendicular to E that we have in mind when we say that the density of field lines is the number per unit area.) This suggests that the flux through any closed surface is a measure of the total charge inside, for the field lines that originate on a positive charge must either pass out through the surface or else terminate on a negative charge inside (Fig. 2.16a). On the other hand, a charge outside the surface will contribute nothing to the total flux, since its field lines pass in one side and out the other (Fig. 2.16b). This is the essence of Gauss’s law. Now let’s make it quantitative. da E Fig. 2.15 (a) 2q E (b) E q \u0002q Fig. 2.16 67 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields In the case of a point charge q at the origin, the flux of E through a spherical surface of radius r is ∮ E · da = ∫ 1 4πϵ0 ( q r2 ˆr) · (r 2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr) = 1 ϵ0 q. (2.12) Notice that the radius of the sphere cancels out, for while the surface area goes up as r 2, the field goes down as 1/r 2, so the product is constant. In terms of the field-line picture, this makes good sense, since the same number of field lines pass through any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its size. In fact, it didn’t have to be a sphere – any closed surface, whatever its shape, would be pierced by the same number of field lines. Evidently, the flux through any surface enclosing the charge is q/ϵ0. Now suppose that instead of a single charge at the origin, we have a bunch of charges scattered about. According to the principle of superposi- tion, the total field is the (vector) sum of all the individual fields: E = n∑ i=1 Ei. The flux through a surface that encloses them all is ∮ E · da = n∑ i=1 (∮ Ei · da) = n∑ i=1 ( 1 ϵ0 qi). For any closed surface, then, ∮ E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc, (2.13) where Qenc is the total charge enclosed within the surface.6 This is the quantitative statement of Gauss’s law. Although it contains no informa- tion that was not already present in Coulomb’s law plus the principle of superposition, it is of almost magical power, as you will see in Section 2.2.3. Notice that it all hinges on the 1/r 2 character of Coulomb’s law; without that the crucial cancelation of the rsin Eq. 2.12 would not occur, and the total flux of E would depend on the surface chosen, not merely on the total charge enclosed. Other 1/r 2 forces (I am thinking particularly of Newton’s law of universal gravitation) will obey “Gauss’s laws” of their own, and the applications we develop here carry over directly. As it stands, Gauss’s law is an integral equation, but we can easily turn it into a differential one, by applying the divergence theorem: ∮ S E · da = ∫ V(∇ · E) dτ. Rewriting Qenc in terms of the charge density ρ,wehave Qenc = ∫ V ρ dτ. 6 If there’s some more charge, outside the surface, it will contribute to the field, of course, but not to the flux. 68 2Electrostatics So Gauss’s law becomes ∫ V(∇ · E) dτ = ∫ V ( ρ ϵ0 ) dτ. And since this holds for any volume, the integrands must themselves be equal:7 ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ. (2.14) Equation 2.14 carries the same message as Eq. 2.13;itis Gauss’s law in differential form. The differential version is tidier, but the integral form has the advantage in that it accommodates point, line, and surface charges more naturally. Problem 2.9. Suppose the electric field in some region is found to be E = kr3ˆr, in spherical coordinates (k is some constant). (a) Find the charge density ρ. (b) Find the total charge contained in a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin. (Do it two different ways.) Problem 2.10. Acharge q sits at the back corner of a cube, as shown in Fig. 2.17. What is the flux of E through the shaded side? q Fig. 2.17 Problem 2.11. Draw a field-line diagram for a uniformly charged solid sphere. 2.2.2 The Divergence of E Let’s go back, now, and calculate the divergence of E directly from Eq. 2.8: E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ all space ˆ 2 ρ(r′) dτ′. (2.15) 7 Think about it: Suppose the integrands were different, in the neighborhood of some point P. Then I could choose V to be a tiny volume centered at P,and the integrals would not be equal. 69 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields (Originally the integration was over the volume occupied by the charge, but I may as well extend it to all space, since ρ = 0 in the exterior region anyway.) Noting that the r-dependence is contained in = r − r′,wehave ∇ · E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ∇ · ( ˆ 2 ) ρ(r′) dτ′. This is precisely the divergence we calculated in Eq. 1.100: ∇ · ( ˆ 2 ) = 4πδ3( ). Thus ∇ · E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 4πδ3(r − r′)ρ(r′) dτ′ = 1 ϵ0 ρ(r), (2.16) which is Gauss’s law in differential form (Eq. 2.14). To recover the integral form (Eq. 2.13), we run the previous argument in reverse – integrate over a volume and apply the divergence theorem: ∫ V ∇ · E dτ = ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 ∫ V ρ dτ = 1 ϵ0 Qenc. 2.2.3 Applications of Gauss’s Law I must interrupt the theoretical development at this point to show you the extraordinary power of Gauss’s law, in integral form. When symmetry permits, it affords by far the quickest and easiest way of computing electric fields. I’ll illustrate the method with a series of examples. Example 2.3. Find the field outside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q. Solution. Imagine a spherical surface at radius r > R (Fig. 2.18); this is called a Gaussian surface in the trade. Gauss’s law says that ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc, and in this case Qenc = q. At first glance this doesn’t seem to get us very far, because the quantity we want (E) is buried inside the surface integral. Luckily, symmetry allows us to extract E from under the integral sign: E certainly points radially outward, 8 as does da,sowe can drop the dot product, 8 If you doubt that E is radial, consider the alternative. Suppose, say, that it points due east, at the “equator.” But the orientation of the equator is perfectly arbitrary – nothing is spinning here, so there is no natural “north–south” axis – any argument purporting to show that E points east could just as well be used to show it points west, or north, or any other direction. The only unique direction on the surface of a sphere is radial. 70 2Electrostatics R r Gaussian surface Fig. 2.18 ∫ S E · da = ∫ S |E| da, and the magnitude of E is constant over the Gaussian surface, so it comes outside the integral: ∫ S |E| da = |E| ∫ S da = |E|4πr 2. Thus |E|4πr 2 = 1 ϵ0 q, or E = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 ˆr. Notice a remarkable feature of this result: the field outside the sphere is exactly the same as it would have been if all the charge had been concentrated at the center! Gauss’s law is always true, but it is not always useful.If ρ had not been uniform (or, at any rate, not spherically symmetrical), or if I had chosen some other shape for my Gaussian surface, it would still have been true that the flux of E is q/ϵ0,but E would not have pointed in the same direction as da, and its magnitude would not have been constant over the surface, and without that I cannot pull |E| outside the integral. Symmetry is crucial to this application of Gauss’s law. As far as I know, there are only three kinds of symmetry that work: (1) Spherical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a concentric sphere. (2) Cylindrical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a coaxial cylinder (Fig. 2.19). (3) Plane symmetry. Use a Gaussian “pillbox” that straddles the surface (Fig. 2.20). Although (2) and (3) technically require infinitely long cylinders, and infinite planes, we shall often use them to get approximate answers for “long” cylinders or “large” planes, as long as we are not near the edges. 71 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields Gaussian surface Fig. 2.19 Gaussian pillbox Fig. 2.20 Example 2.4. A long cylinder (Fig. 2.21) carries a charge density that is proportional to the distance from the axis: ρ = ks, for some constant k. Find the electric field inside this cylinder. Solution. Draw a Gaussian cylinder of length l and radius s. For this surface, Gauss’s law states that ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc. The enclosed charge is Qenc = ∫ ρ dτ = ∫ (ks′)(s′ ds′ dφ dz) = 2πkl ∫ s 0 s′2 ds′ = 2 3 πkls 3. (I used the volume element appropriate to cylindrical coordinates, Eq. 1.78, and integrated φ from 0 to 2π, dz from 0 to l. I put a prime on the integration variable s′, to distinguish it from the radius s of the Gaussian surface.) E s Gaussian surface l E Fig. 2.21 Now, symmetry dictates that E must point radially outward, so for the curved portion of the Gaussian cylinder we have ∫ E · da = ∫ |E| da = |E| ∫ da = |E|2πsl, while the two ends contribute nothing (here E is perpendicular to da). Thus, |E|2πsl = 1 ϵ0 2 3 πkls 3, or, finally, E = 1 3ϵ0 ks 2ˆs. 72 2Electrostatics Example 2.5. An infinite plane carries a uniform surface charge σ. Find its electric field. Solution. Draw a “Gaussian pillbox,” extending equal distances above and below the plane (Fig. 2.22). Apply Gauss’s law to this surface: ∮ E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc. E E A Fig. 2.22 In this case, Qenc = σA,where A is the area of the lid of the pillbox. By symmetry, E points away from the plane (upward for points above, downward for points below). So the top and bottom surfaces yield ∫ E · da = 2A|E|, whereas the sides contribute nothing. Thus 2A|E| = 1 ϵ0 σA, or E = σ 2ϵ0 ˆn, (2.17) where ˆn is a unit vector pointing away from the surface. In Prob. 2.6, you obtained this same result by a much more laborious method. It seems surprising, at first, that the field of an infinite plane is independent of how far away you are. What about the 1/r 2 in Coulomb’s law? The point is that as you move farther and farther away from the plane, more and more charge comes into your “field of view” (a cone shape extending out from your eye), and this compensates for the diminishing influence of any particular piece. The electric field of a sphere falls off like 1/r 2; the electric field of an infinite line falls off like 1/s; and the electric field of an infinite plane does not fall off at all (you cannot escape from an infinite plane). Although the direct use of Gauss’s law to compute electric fields is limited to cases of spherical, cylindrical, and planar symmetry, we can put together combinations of objects possessing such symmetry, even if the arrangement as a whole is not symmetrical. For example, invoking the principle of superposition, we could find the field in the vicinity of two uni- formly charged parallel cylinders, or a sphere near an infinite charged plane. 73 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields Example 2.6. Two infinite parallel planes carry equal but opposite uniform charge densities ±σ (Fig. 2.23). Find the field in each of the following three regions: (i) to the left of both, (ii) between them, (iii) to the right of both. Solution. The left-hand plate produces a field (1/2ϵ0)σ, which points away from it – to the left in region (i) and to the right in regions (ii) and (iii) (Fig. 2.24). The right-hand plate, being negatively charged, produces a field (1/2ϵ0)σ, which points toward it – to the right in regions (i) and (ii) and to the left in region (iii). The two fields cancel in regions (i) and (iii); they conspire in region (ii). Conclusion: The field between the plates is σ/ϵ0, and points to the right; elsewhere it is zero.

Use Gauss’s law to find the electric field inside and outside a spherical shell of radius R that carries a uniform surface charge density σ. Compare your answer to Prob. 2.7; notice how much quicker and easier Gauss’s method is. Problem 2.13. Use Gauss’s law to find the electric field inside a uniformly charged solid sphere (charge density ρ). Compare your answer to Prob. 2.8. Problem 2.14. Find the electric field a distance s from an infinitely long straight wire that carries a uniform line charge λ.Compare Eq. 2.9. Problem 2.15. Find the electric field inside a sphere that carries a charge density proportional to the distance from the center, ρ = kr,for some constant k.[ Caution: This charge density is not uniform, and you must integrate to get the enclosed charge.] Problem 2.16. A thick spherical shell carries charge density ρ = k r2 (a ≤ r ≤ b) (Fig. 2.25). Find the electric field in the following three regions: (i) r < a, (ii) a < r < b, (iii) r > b. Plot |E| as a function of r, for the case b = 2a. 74 2Electrostatics a b Fig. 2.25 a b + \u0002 Fig. 2.26 2d x y z Fig. 2.27 d + \u0002 Fig. 2.28 Problem 2.17. A long coaxial cable (Fig. 2.26)carries auniform volume charge density ρ on the inner cylinder (radius a), and a uniform surface charge density σ on the outer cylindrical shell (radius b). This surface charge is negative and is of just the right magnitude that the cable as a whole is electrically neutral. Find the electric field in each of the following three regions: (i) inside the inner cylinder (s < a), (ii) between the cylinders (a < s < b), (iii) outside the cable (s > b). Plot |E| as a function of s. Problem 2.18. An infinite plane slab, of thickness 2d, carries a uniform volume charge density ρ (Fig. 2.27). Find the electric field, as a function of y,where y = 0 at the center. Plot E versus y, calling E positive when E points in the +y direction and negative when it points in the −y direction. • Problem 2.19. Two spheres, each of radius R and carrying uniform volume charge densities +ρ and −ρ, respectively, are placed so that they partially overlap (Fig. 2.28). Call the vector from the positive center to the negative center d. Show that the field in the region of overlap is constant, and find its value. [Hint: Use the answer to Prob. 2.13.] 2.2.4 The Curl of E I’ll calculate the curl of E, as I did the divergence in Section 2.2.1,by studying first the simplest possible configuration: a point charge at the origin. In this case, 75 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields z x q rb ra y b a Fig. 2.29 E = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 ˆr. Now, a glance at Fig. 2.12 should convince you that the curl of this field has to be zero, but I suppose we ought to come up with something a little more rigorous than that. What if we calculate the line integral of this field from some point a to some other point b (Fig. 2.29): ∫ b a E · dl. In spherical coordinates, dl = dr ˆr + rdθ ˆθ + r sin θ dφ ˆφ,so E · dl = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 dr. Therefore, ∫ b a E · dl = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ b a q r2 dr = −1 4πϵ0 q r ||| rb ra = 1 4πϵ0 ( q ra − q rb ), (2.18) where ra is the distance from the origin to the point a and rb is the distance to b. The integral around a closed path is evidently zero (for then ra = rb): ∮ E · dl = 0, (2.19) and hence, applying Stokes’ theorem (and noting that Eq. 2.19 applies to any closed path), ∇ × E = 0. (2.20) Now, I proved Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 only for the field of a single point charge at the origin, but these results make no reference to what is, after all, a perfectly arbitrary choice of coordinates; they hold no matter where the charge is located. Moreover, if we have many charges, the principle of superposition says that the total field is the vector sum of their individual fields: E = E1 + E2 + ··· , 76 2Electrostatics so ∇ × E = ∇ × (E1 + E2 + ··· ) = (∇ × E1) + (∇ × E2) + ··· = 0. Thus, Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 hold for any (static) charge distribution whatever. Problem 2.20. Calculate ∇ × E directly from Eq. 2.8, by the method of Section 2.2.2. Refer to Prob. 1.63b if you get stuck. 2.3 Electric Potential 2.3.1 Introduction to Potential The electric field E is not just any old vector function. It is a very special kind of vector function: one whose curl is zero. The vector E = yˆx,for example, could not possibly be an electrostatic field; no set of charges, regardless of their sizes and positions, could ever produce such a field. We’re going to exploit this special property of electric fields to reduce a vector problem (finding E) to a much simpler scalar problem. The first theorem in Section 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I’m going to do now amounts to a proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics. Because ∇ × E = 0, the line integral of E around any closed loop is zero (that follows from Stokes’ theorem). Because ∮ E · dl = 0, the line integral of E from point a to point b is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go out along path (i) and return along path (ii) – Fig. 2.30 – and obtain∮ E · dl \u0002 0). Because the line integral is independent of path, we can define a function9 V (r) ≡− ∫ r O E · dl. (2.21) b a (i) (ii) Fig. 2.30 9 To avoid any possible ambiguity, I should perhaps put a prime on the integration variable: V (r) = − ∫ r O E(r ′) · dl ′. But this makes for cumbersome notation, and I prefer whenever possible to reserve the primes for source points. However, when (as in Ex. 2.7) we calculate such integrals explicitly, I will restore the primes. 77 2.3 Electric Potential Here O is some standard reference point on which we have agreed beforehand; V then depends only on the point r. It is called the electric potential. The potential difference between two points a and b is V (b) − V (a) = − ∫ b O E · dl + ∫ a O E · dl = − ∫ b O E · dl − ∫ O a E · dl = − ∫ b a E · dl. (2.22) Now, the fundamental theorem for gradients states that V (b) − V (a) = ∫ b a (∇V ) · dl, so ∫ b a (∇V ) · dl = − ∫ b a E · dl. Since, finally, this is true for any points a and b, the integrands must be equal: E = −∇V . (2.23) Equation 2.23 is the differential version of Eq. 2.21; it says that the electric field is the gradient of a scalar potential, which is what we set out to prove. Notice the subtle but crucial role played by path independence (or, equivalently, the fact that ∇ × E = 0) in this argument. If the line integral of E depended on the path taken, then the “definition” of V , Eq. 2.21, would be nonsense. It would not define a function, since changing the path would alter the value of V (r). By the way, don’t let the minus sign in Eq. 2.23 distract you; it carries over from Eq. 2.21 and is largely a matter of convention. Problem 2.21. One of these is an impossible electrostatic field. Which one? (a) E = k[xyˆx + 2yzˆy + 3xzˆz]. (b) E = k[y2ˆx + (2xy + z2)ˆy + 2yzˆz]. Here k is a (nonzero) constant with the appropriate units. For the possible one, find the potential, using the origin as your reference point. Check your answer by computing ∇V.[Hint: You must select a specific path to integrate along. It doesn’t matter what path you choose, since the answer is path independent, but you simply cannot integrate unless you have a definite path in mind.] 78 2Electrostatics 2.3.2 Comments on Potential (i) The name. The word “potential” is a hideous misnomer because it inevitably reminds you of potential energy. This is particularly insidious, because there is a connection between “potential” and “potential energy,” as you will see in Section 2.4. I’m sorry that it is impossible to escape this word. The best I can do is to insist once and for all that “potential” and “potential energy” are completely different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentally, a region (typically a surface) over which the potential is constant is called an equipotential. (ii) Advantage of the potential formulation. If you know V , you can easily get E – just take the gradient: E = −∇V . This is quite extraordinary when you stop to think about it, for E is a vector quantity (three components), but V is a scalar (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the information that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three components of E are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are explicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with, ∇ × E = 0. In terms of the components, ∂Ex ∂y = ∂Ey ∂x , ∂Ez ∂y = ∂Ey ∂z , ∂Ex ∂z = ∂Ez ∂x . This brings us back to my observation at the beginning of Section 2.3.1: E is a very special kind of vector. What the potential formulation does is to exploit this feature to maximum advantage, reducing a vector problem to a scalar one, in which there is no need to fuss with components. (iii) The reference point O. There is an essential ambiguity in the def- inition of potential, since the choice of reference point O was arbitrary. Changing reference points amounts to adding a constant K to the potential: V ′(r) = − ∫ r O′ E · dl = − ∫ O O′ E · dl − ∫ r O E · dl = K + V (r), where K is the line integral of E from the old reference point O to the new one O′. Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential difference between two points: V ′(b) − V ′(a) = V (b) − V (a), since the Ks cancel out. (Actually, it was already clear from Eq. 2.22 that the potential difference is independent of O, because it can be written as the line integral of E from a to b, with no mention of O.) Nor does the ambiguity affect the gradient of V : ∇V ′ = ∇V , since the derivative of a constant is zero. That’s why all such V s, differing only in their choice of reference point, correspond to the same field E. Potential as such carries no real physical significance, for at any given point we can adjust its value at will by a suitable relocation of O. In this 79 2.3 Electric Potential sense, it is rather like altitude: If I ask you how high Denver is, you will probably tell me its height above sea level, because that is a convenient and traditional reference point. But we could as well agree to measure altitude above Washington, DC, or Greenwich, or wherever. That would add (or, rather, subtract) a fixed amount from all our sea-level readings, but it wouldn’t change anything about the real world. The only quantity with intrinsic meaning is the difference in altitude between two points, and that is the same whatever your reference level. Having said this, however, there is a “natural” spot to use for O in electrostatics – analogous to sea level for altitude – and that is a point infinitely far from the charge. Ordinarily, then, we “set the zero of potential at infinity.” (Since V (O) = 0, choosing a reference point is equivalent to selecting a place where V is to be zero.) But I must warn you that there is one special circumstance in which this convention fails: when the charge distribution itself extends to infinity. The symptom of trouble, in such cases, is that the potential blows up. For instance, the field of a uniformly charged plane is (σ/2ϵ0)ˆn, as we found in Ex. 2.5; if we naïvely put O = ∞, then the potential at height z above the plane becomes V (z) = − ∫ z ∞ 1 2ϵ0 σ dz = − 1 2ϵ0 σ(z −∞). The remedy is simply to choose some other reference point (in this example you might use a point on the plane). Notice that this difficulty occurs only in textbook problems; in “real life” there is no such thing as a charge distribution that goes on forever, and we can always use infinity as our reference point. (iv) Potential obeys the superposition principle. The original superposition principle pertains to the force on a test charge Q. It says that the total force on Q is the vector sum of the forces attributable to the source charges individually: F = F1 + F2 + ··· . Dividing through by Q, we find that the electric field, too, obeys the superposition principle: E = E1 + E2 + ··· . Integrating from the common reference point to r, it follows that the potential also satisfies such a principle: V = V1 + V2 + ··· . That is, the potential at any given point is the sum of the potentials due to all the source charges separately. Only this time it is an ordinary sum, not a vector sum, which makes it a lot easier to work with. (v) Units of Potential. In our units, force is measured in newtons and charge in coulombs, so electric fields are in newtons per coulomb. Accord- ingly, potential is newton-meters per coulomb, or joules per coulomb. A joule per coulomb is a volt. 80 2Electrostatics Example 2.7. Find the potential inside and outside a spherical shell of radius R (Fig. 2.31) that carries a uniform surface charge. Set the reference point at infinity. R Pr Fig. 2.31 Solution. From Gauss’s law, the field outside is E = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 ˆr, where q is the total charge on the sphere. The field inside is zero. For points outside the sphere (r > R), V (r) = − ∫ r O E · dl = −1 4πϵ0 ∫ r ∞ q r′2 dr′ = 1 4πϵ0 q r′ ||| r ∞ = 1 4πϵ0 q r . To find the potential inside the sphere (r < R), we must break the integral into two pieces, using in each region the field that prevails there: V (r) = −1 4πϵ0 ∫ R ∞ q r′2 dr′ − ∫ r R (0) dr′ = 1 4πϵ0 q r′ ||| R ∞ + 0 = 1 4πϵ0 q R . Notice that the potential is not zero inside the shell, even though the field vanishes! To be sure, V is a constant in this region, so that ∇V = 0 – that’s what matters. In problems of this type, you must always work your way in from the reference point; that’s where the potential is “nailed down.” It is tempting to suppose that you could figure out the potential inside the sphere on the basis of the field there alone, but this is false: the potential inside the sphere is sensitive to what’s going on outside the sphere as well. If I placed a second uniformly charged shell out at radius R′ > R, the potential inside R would change, even though the field would still be zero. Gauss’s law guarantees that charge exterior to a given point (that is, at larger r) produces no net field at that point, provided it is spherically or cylindrically symmetric, but there is no such rule for potential, when infinity is used as the reference point. Problem 2.22. Find the potential inside and outside a uniformly charged solid sphere whose radius is R and whose total charge is q. Use infinity as your reference point. Compute the gradient of V in each region, and check that it yields the correct field. Sketch V (r). 81 2.3 Electric Potential • Problem 2.23. Find the potential a distance s from an infinitely long straight wire that carries a uniform line charge λ. Compute the gradient of your potential, and check that it yields the correct field. Problem 2.24. For the charge configuration of Prob. 2.16, find the potential at the center, using infinity as your reference point. Problem 2.25. For the configuration of Prob. 2.17, find the potential difference between a point on the axis and a point on the outer cylinder. Note that it is not necessary to commit yourself to a particular reference point, if you use Eq. 2.22. 2.3.3 Poisson’s Equation and Laplace’s Equation We found in Section 2.3.1 that the electric field can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential, E = −∇V . The following question arises: What do the divergence and curl of E, ∇ · E = ρ ϵ0 and ∇ × E = 0, tell us about V ? Well, ∇ · E = ∇ · (−∇V ) = −∇ 2V ,so, apartfromthat persistent minus sign, the divergence of E is the Laplacian of V . Gauss’s law, then, says ∇ 2V = − ρ ϵ0 . (2.24) This is known as Poisson’s equation. In regions where there is no charge, so ρ = 0, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation, ∇ 2V = 0. (2.25) We’ll explore this equation more fully in Chapter 3. So much for Gauss’s law. What about the curl law? This says that ∇ × E = ∇ × (−∇V ) = 0. But that’s no condition on V ; curl of gradient is always zero. Of course, we used the curl law to show that E could be expressed as the gradient of a scalar, so it’s not really surprising that this works out: ∇ × E = 0 permits E = −∇V ; in return, E = −∇V guarantees ∇ × E = 0. It takes only one differential equation (Poisson’s) to determine V , because V is a scalar; for E we needed two, the divergence and the curl. 82 2Electrostatics 2.3.4 The Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution I defined V in terms of E (Eq. 2.21). Ordinarily, though, it’s E that we’re looking for (if we already knew E, there wouldn’t be much point in calcu- lating V ). The idea is that it might be easier to get V first, and then calculate E by taking the gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know ρ), and we want to find V . Now, Poisson’s equation relates V and ρ, but unfortunately it’s “the wrong way around”: it would give us ρ, if we knew V , whereas we want V , knowing ρ. What we must do, then, is “invert” Poisson’s equation. That’s the program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning, as always, with a point charge at the origin. The electric field is E = (1/4πϵ0)(q/r 2)ˆr,and dl = dr ˆr + rdθ ˆθ + r sin θ dφ ˆφ (Eq. 1.68), so E · dl = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 dr. Setting the reference point at infinity, the potential of a point charge q at the origin is V (r) = − ∫ r O E · dl = −1 4πϵ0 ∫ r ∞ q r′2 dr′ = 1 4πϵ0 q r′ ||| r ∞ = 1 4πϵ0 q r . (You see here the advantage of using infinity for the reference point: it kills the lower limit on the integral.) Notice the sign of V ; presumably the conventional minus sign in the definition (Eq. 2.21) was chosen in order to make the potential of a positive charge come out positive. It is useful to remember that regions of positive charge are potential “hills,” regions of negative charge are potential “valleys,” and the electric field points “downhill,” from plus toward minus. In general, the potential of a point charge q is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 q , (2.26) where , as always, is the distance from q to r (Fig. 2.32). Invoking the superposition principle, then, the potential of a collection of charges is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 n∑ i=1 qi i , (2.27) P i q q1 q2 P qi P dτ Fig. 2.32 83 2.3 Electric Potential or, for a continuous distribution, V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 1 dq. (2.28) In particular, for a volume charge, it is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′) dτ′. (2.29) This is the equation we were looking for, telling us how to compute V when we know ρ; it is, if you like, the “solution” to Poisson’s equation, for a localized charge distribution. 10 Compare Eq. 2.29 with the corresponding formula for the electric field in terms of ρ (Eq. 2.8): E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′) 2 ˆ dτ′. The main point to notice is that the pesky unit vector ˆ is gone, so you don’t have to worry about components. The potentials of line and surface charges are V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ λ(r′) dl′ and V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ σ(r′) da′. (2.30) I should warn you that everything in this section is predicated on the assumption that the reference point is at infinity. This is certainly not obvi- ous in Eq. 2.29, but remember that we got that equation from the potential of a point charge at the origin, (1/4πϵ0)(q/r), which is valid only when O = ∞. If you try to apply these formulas to one of those artificial problems in which the charge itself extends to infinity, the integral will diverge – that’s the alarm bell, telling you to go back and fix the reference point. Example 2.8. Find the potential of a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius R (Fig. 2.33). θ Fig. 2.33 10 Equation 2.29 is an example of the Helmholtz theorem (Appendix B). 84 2Electrostatics Solution. This is the same problem we solved in Ex. 2.7, but this time let’s do it using Eq. 2.30: V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ σ da′. We might as well set the point P on the z-axis and use the law of cosines to express : 2 = R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ′. An element of surface area on the sphere is R 2 sin θ′ dθ′ dφ′,so 4πϵ0V (z) = σ ∫ R2 sin θ′ dθ′ dφ′ √ R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ′ = 2πR2σ ∫ π 0 sin θ′ √ R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ′ dθ′ = 2πR2σ ( 1 Rz √ R2 + z2 − 2Rz cos θ′)||| π 0 = 2πRσ z (√ R2 + z2 + 2Rz − √R2 + z2 − 2Rz) = 2πRσ z [√(R + z)2 − √(R − z)2]. At this stage, we must be very careful to take the positive root. For points outside the sphere, z is greater than R, and hence √(R − z)2 = z − R; for points inside the sphere, √(R − z)2 = R − z. Thus, V (z) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ Rσ 2ϵ0Z [(R + z) − (z − R)] = R2σ ϵ0Z outside, Rσ 2ϵ0Z [(R + z) − (R − z)] = Rσ ϵ0 inside. In terms of r and the total charge on the shell, q = 4πR 2σ, V (r) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ 1 4πϵ0 q r (r ≥ R), 1 4πϵ0 q R (r ≤ R). Of course, in this particular case, it was easier to get V by using Eq. 2.21 than Eq. 2.30, because Gauss’s law gave us E with so little effort. But if you compare Ex. 2.8 with Prob. 2.7, you will appreciate the power of the potential formulation. Problem 2.26. Using Eqs. 2.27 and 2.30, find the potential at a distance z above the cen- ter of the charge distributions in Fig. 2.34.Ineachcase, compute E = −∇V,and compare your answers with Ex. 2.1, Ex. 2.2,and Prob. 2.6, respectively. Suppose that we changed the 85 2.3 Electric Potential right-hand charge in Fig. 2.34a to −q: What then is the potential at P? What field does that suggest? Compare your answer to Prob. 2.2, and explain carefully any discrepancy. z P \u0004q +qd (a) Two point charges z P 2L (b) Uniform line charge λ P z (c) Uniform surface charge Rσ Fig. 2.34 Problem 2.27. A conical surface (an empty ice-cream cone) carries a uniform surface charge σ. The height of the cone is h, as is the radius of the top. Find the potential difference between points a (the vertex) and b (the center of the top). Problem 2.28. Find the potential on the axis of a uniformly charged solid cylinder, a distance z from the center. The length of the cylinder is L,its radius is R, and the charge density is ρ. Use your result to calculate the electric field at this point. (Assume that z > L/2.) Problem 2.29. Use Eq. 2.29 to calculate the potential inside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q. Compare your answer to Prob. 2.22. Problem 2.30. Check that Eq. 2.29 satisfies Poisson’s equation, by applying the Laplacian and using Eq. 1.102. 2.3.5 Boundary Conditions In the typical electrostatic problem you are given a source charge distri- bution ρ, and you want to find the electric field E it produces. Unless the symmetry of the problem allows a solution by Gauss’s law, it is generally to your advantage to calculate the potential first, as an intermediate step. These are the three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: ρ, E,and V . We have, in the course of our discussion, derived all six formulas interrelat- ing them. These equations are neatly summarized in Fig. 2.35. We began with just two experimental observations: (1) the principle of superposi- tion – a broad general rule applying to all electromagnetic forces, and (2) Coulomb’s law – the fundamental law of electrostatics. From these, all else followed. You may have noticed, in studying Exs. 2.5 and 2.6, or working problems such as 2.7, 2.12,and 2.17, that the electric field always undergoes a discontinuity when you cross a surface charge σ. In fact, it is a simple matter to find the amount by which E changes at such a boundary. Suppose we draw 86 2Electrostatics ρρρττπϵπϵϵρρϵ Fig. 2.35 σ ϵ aboveE Ebelow Fig. 2.36 a wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox, extending just barely over the edge in each direction (Fig. 2.36). Gauss’s law says that ∮ S E · da = 1 ϵ0 Qenc = 1 ϵ0 σA, where A is the area of the pillbox lid. (If σ varies from point to point or the surface is curved, we must pick A to be extremely small.) Now, the sides of the pillbox contribute nothing to the flux, in the limit as the thickness ϵ goes to zero, so we are left with E⊥ above − E⊥ below = 1 ϵ0 σ, (2.31) where E⊥ above denotes the component of E that is perpendicular to the surface immediately above, and E⊥ below is the same, only just below the surface. For consistency, we let “upward” be the positive direction for both. Conclusion: The normal component of E is discontinuous by an amount σ/ϵ0 at any boundary. In particular, where there is no surface charge, E⊥ is continuous, as for instance at the surface of a uniformly charged solid sphere. The tangential component of E, by contrast, is always continuous. For if we apply Eq. 2.19, ∮ E · dl = 0, 87 2.3 Electric Potential σ ϵ aboveE E below Fig. 2.37 b a σ Fig. 2.38 to the thin rectangular loop of Fig. 2.37, the ends give nothing (as ϵ → 0), and the sides give (E ∥ abovel − E ∥ belowl),so E ∥ above = E ∥ below, (2.32) where E ∥ stands for the components of E parallel to the surface. The boundary conditions on E (Eqs. 2.31 and 2.32) can be combined into a single formula: Eabove − Ebelow = σ ϵ0 ˆn, (2.33) where ˆn is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from “below” to “above.” 11 The potential, meanwhile, is continuous across any boundary (Fig. 2.38), since Vabove − Vbelow = − ∫ b a E · dl; as the path length shrinks to zero, so too does the integral: Vabove = Vbelow. (2.34) However, the gradient of V inherits the discontinuity in E; since E = −∇V , Eq. 2.33 implies that ∇Vabove − ∇Vbelow = − 1 ϵ0 σˆn, (2.35) 11 Notice that it doesn’t matter which side you call “above” and which “below,” since reversal would switch the direction of ˆn. Incidentally, if you’re only interested in the field due to the (essentially flat) local patch of surface charge itself, the answer is (σ/2ϵ0)ˆn immediately above the surface, and −(σ/2ϵ0)ˆn immediately below. This follows from Ex. 2.5,for if you are close enough to the patch it “looks” like an infinite plane. Evidently, the entire discontinuity in E is attributable to this local patch of surface charge. 88 2Electrostatics or, more conveniently, ∂Vabove ∂n − ∂Vbelow ∂n = − 1 ϵ0 σ, (2.36) where ∂V ∂n = ∇V · ˆn (2.37) denotes the normal derivative of V (that is, the rate of change in the direction perpendicular to the surface). Please note that these boundary conditions relate the fields and poten- tials just above and just below the surface. For example, the derivatives in Eq. 2.36 are the limiting values as we approach the surface from either side. Problem 2.31. (a) Check that the results of Exs. 2.5 and 2.6,and Prob. 2.12, are consistent with Eq. 2.33. (b) Use Gauss’s law to find the field inside and outside a long hollow cylindrical tube, which carries a uniform surface charge σ. Check that your result is consistent with Eq. 2.33. (c) Check that the result of Ex. 2.8 is consistent with boundary conditions 2.34 and 2.36. 2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics 2.4.1 The Work It Takes to Move a Charge Suppose you have a stationary configuration of source charges, and you want to move a test charge Q from point a to point b (Fig. 2.39). Question: How much work will you have to do? At any point along the path, the electric force on Q is F = QE; the force you must exert, in opposition to this electrical force, is −QE. (If the sign bothers you, think about lifting a brick: gravity exerts a force mg downward,but you exert a force mg upward. Of course, you could apply an even greater force – then the brick would accelerate, and part of your effort would be “wasted” generating kinetic energy. What we’re interested in here is the minimum force you must exert to do the job.) The work you do is therefore W = ∫ b a F · dl = −Q ∫ b a E · dl = Q[V (b) − V (a)]. q1 q2 qi a b Q Fig. 2.39 89 2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics Notice that the answer is independent of the path you take from a to b; in mechanics, then, we would call the electrostatic force “conservative.” Dividing through by Q,wehave V (b) − V (a) = W Q . (2.38) In words, the potential difference between points a and b is equal to the work it takes, per unit charge, to carry a particle from a to b. In particular, if you want to bring Q in from far away and stick it at point r, the work you must do is W = Q[V (r) − V (∞)], so, if you have set the reference point at infinity, W = QV (r). (2.39) In this sense, potential is potential energy (the work required to create the system) per unit charge (just as the field is the force per unit charge). 2.4.2 The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution How much work would it take to assemble an entire collection of point charges? Imagine bringing in the charges, one by one, from far away (Fig. 2.40). The first charge, q1,takes no work, since there is no field yet to fight against. Now bring in q2. According to Eq. 2.39, this will cost you q2V1(r2),where V1 is the potential due to q1,and r2 is the place we’re putting q2: W2 = 1 4πϵ0 q2 ( q1 12 ) ( 12 is the distance between q1 and q2 once they are in position). As you bring in each charge, nail it down in its final location, so it doesn’t move when you bring in the next charge. Now bring in q3; this requires work q3V1,2(r3),where V1,2 is the potential due to charges q1 and q2,namely, (1/4πϵ0)(q1/ 13 + q2/ 23). Thus W3 = 1 4πϵ0 q3 ( q1 13 + q2 23 ). Fig. 2.40 90 2Electrostatics Similarly, the extra work to bring in q4 will be W4 = 1 4πϵ0 q4 ( q1 14 + q2 24 + q3 34 ). The total work necessary to assemble the first four charges, then, is W = 1 4πϵ0 ( q1q2 12 + q1q3 13 + q1q4 14 + q2q3 23 + q2q4 24 + q3q4 34 ). You see the general rule: take the product of each pair of charges, divide by their separation distance, and add it all up: W = 1 4πϵ0 n∑ i=1 n∑ j>i qiqj ij . (2.40) The stipulation j > i is to remind you not to count the same pair twice. A nicer way to accomplish this is intentionally to count each pair twice, and then divide by 2: W = 1 8πϵ0 n∑ i=1 n∑ j\u0002i qiqj ij (2.41) (we must still exclude i = j, of course). Notice that in this form the answer plainly does not depend on the order in which you assemble the charges, since every pair occurs in the sum. Finally, let’s pull out the factor qi: W = 1 2 n∑ i=1 qi ( n∑ j\u0002i 1 4πϵ0 qj ij ). The term in parentheses is the potential at point ri (the position of qi) due to all the other charges – all of them, now, not just the ones that were present at some stage during the assembly. Thus, W = 1 2 n∑ i=1 qiV (ri). (2.42) That’s how much work it takes to assemble a configuration of point charges; it’s also the amount of work you’d get back if you dismantled the system. In the meantime, it represents energy stored in the configuration (“potential” energy, if you insist, though for obvious reasons I prefer to avoid that word in this context). Problem 2.32. (a) Three charges are situated at the corners of a square (side length a), as shown in Fig. 2.41. How much work does it take to bring in another charge, +q, from far away and place it in the fourth corner? (b) How much work does it take to assemble the entire configuration of four charges? 91 2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics \u0002q \u0004q a a \u0002q Fig. 2.41 Problem 2.33. Two positive point charges, qA and qB (masses mA and mB) are at rest, held together by a massless string of length a. Now the string is cut, and the particles fly off in opposite directions. How fast is each one going, when they are far apart? Problem 2.34. Consider an infinite chain of point charges, ±q (with alternating signs), strung out along the x-axis, each a distance a from its nearest neighbors. Find the work per particle required to assemble this system. [Partial answer: −αq2/(4πϵ0a), for some dimensionless number α; your problem is to determine α.Itisknown asthe Madelung constant.Calcu- lating the Madelung constant for two- and three-dimensional arrays is much more subtle and difficult.] 2.4.3 The Energy of a Continuous Charge Distribution For a volume charge density ρ, Eq. 2.42 becomes W = 1 2 ∫ ρVdτ. (2.43) (The corresponding integrals for line and surface charges would be ∫ λVdl and ∫ σVda.) There is a lovely way to rewrite this result, in which ρ and V are eliminated in favor of E. First use Gauss’s law to express ρ in terms of E: ρ = ϵ0∇ · E,so W = ϵ0 2 ∫ (∇ · E)Vdτ. Now use integration by parts (Eq. 1.59) to transfer the derivative from E to V : W = ϵ0 2 [− ∫ V E · (∇V ) dτ + ∮ S V E · da]. But ∇V = −E,so W = ϵ0 2 (∫ V E2 dτ + ∮ S V E · da). (2.44) But what volume V is this we’re integrating over? Let’s go back to the formula we started with, Eq. 2.43. From its derivation, it is clear that we should integrate over the region where the charge is located. But actually, any larger volume would do just as well: the “extra” territory we throw in will contribute nothing to the integral, since ρ = 0 out there. With this in mind, we return to Eq. 2.44. What happens here, as we enlarge the volume beyond the minimum necessary to trap all the charge? Well, the integral of 92 2Electrostatics E2 can only increase (the integrand being positive); evidently the surface integral must decrease correspondingly, to leave the sum intact. (In fact, at large distances from the charge, E goes like 1/r 2 and V like 1/r, while the surface area grows like r 2; roughly speaking, then, the surface integral goes down like 1/r.) Please understand: Eq. 2.44 gives you the correct energy W , whatever volume you use (as long as it encloses all the charge), but the contribution from the volume integral goes up, and that of the surface integral goes down, as you take larger and larger volumes. In particular, why not integrate over all space? Then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with W = ϵ0 2 ∫ E2 dτ (all space). (2.45) Example 2.9. Find the energy of a uniformly charged spherical shell of total charge q and radius R. Solution 1. Use Eq. 2.43, in the version appropriate to surface charges: W = 1 2 ∫ σVda. Now, the potential at the surface of this sphere is (1/4πϵ0)q/R,a constant (Ex. 2.7), so W = 1 8πϵ0 q R ∫ σ da = 1 8πϵ0 q 2 R . Solution 2. Use Eq. 2.45. Inside the sphere, E = 0; outside, E = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 ˆr,so E2 = q 2 (4πϵ0)2r4 . Therefore, W = ϵ0 2(4πϵ0)2 ∫ outside ( q 2 r4 ) (r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ) = 1 32π2ϵ0 q 24π ∫ ∞ R 1 r2 dr = 1 8πϵ0 q 2 R . Problem 2.35. Find the energy stored in a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and charge q. Do it three different ways: (a) Use Eq. 2.43. You found the potential in Prob. 2.22. (b) Use Eq. 2.45. Don’t forget to integrate over all space. (c) Use Eq. 2.44. Take a spherical volume of radius a. What happens as a →∞? 93 2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics Problem 2.36. Here is a fourth way of computing the energy of a uniformly charged solid sphere (you might call it the method of assembly): Build it up like a snowball, layer by layer, each time bringing in an infinitesimal charge dq from far away and smearing it uniformly over the surface, thereby increasing the radius. How much work dW does it take to advance the radius from r to r + dr? Integrate your result to find the work necessary to create the entire sphere of radius R and total charge q. 2.4.4 Comments on Electrostatic Energy (i) A perplexing “inconsistency.” Equation 2.45 clearly implies that the energy of a stationary charge distribution is always positive. On the other hand, Eq. 2.42 (from which 2.45 was derived), can be positive or negative. For instance, according to Eq. 2.42, the energy of two equal but opposite charges a distance apart is −(1/4πϵ0)(q 2/ ). What’s gone wrong? Which equation is correct? The answer is that both are correct, but they address slightly different questions. Equation 2.42 does not take into account the work necessary to make the point charges in the first place; we started with point charges and simply found the work required to bring them together. This is wise strategy, since Eq. 2.45 indicates that the energy of a point charge is in fact infinite: W = ϵ0 2(4πϵ0)2 ∫ ( q 2 r4 ) (r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ) = q 2 8πϵ0 ∫ ∞ 0 1 r2 dr = ∞. Equation 2.45 is more complete, in the sense that it tells you the total energy stored in a charge configuration, but Eq. 2.42 is more appropriate when you’re dealing with point charges, because we prefer (for good reason!) to leave out that portion of the total energy that is attributable to the fabrication of the point charges themselves. In practice, after all, the point charges (electrons, say) are given to us ready-made; all we do is move them around. Since we did not put them together, and we cannot take them apart, it is immaterial how much work the process would involve. (Still, the infinite energy of a point charge is a recurring source of embarrassment for electromagnetic theory, afflicting the quantum version as well as the classical. We shall return to the problem in Chapter 11.) Now, you may wonder where the inconsistency crept into an ostensibly watertight derivation. The “flaw” lies between Eqs. 2.42 and 2.43:inthe former, V (ri) represents the potential due to all the other charges but not qi, whereas in the latter, V (r) is the full potential. For a continuous distribution, there is no distinction, since the amount of charge right at the point r is vanishingly small, and its contribution to the potential is zero. But in the presence of point charges you’d better stick with Eq. 2.42. (ii) Where is the energy stored? Equations 2.43 and 2.45 offer two dif- ferent ways of calculating the same thing. The first is an integral over 94 2Electrostatics the charge distribution; the second is an integral over the field. These can involve completely different regions. For instance, in the case of the spherical shell (Ex. 2.9), the charge is confined to the surface, whereas the electric field is everywhere outside this surface. Where is the energy, then? Is it stored in the field, as Eq. 2.45 suggests, or is it stored in the charge, as Eq. 2.43 implies? At the present stage this is simply an unanswerable question: I can tell you what the total energy is, and I can provide you with several different ways to calculate it, but it is pointless to worry about where the energy is located. In the context of radiation theory (Chapter 11)itis useful (and in general relativity it is essential) to regard the energy as stored in the field, with a density ϵ0 2 E2 = energy per unit volume. (2.46) But in electrostatics one could just as well say it is stored in the charge, with adensity 1 2 ρV . The difference is purely a question of bookkeeping.12 (iii) The superposition principle. Because electrostatic energy is quadratic in the fields, it does not obey a superposition principle. The energy of a compound system is not the sum of the energies of its parts considered separately – there are also “cross terms”: Wtot = ϵ0 2 ∫ E2 dτ = ϵ0 2 ∫ (E1 + E2)2 dτ = ϵ0 2 ∫ (E2 1 + E2 2 + 2E1 · E2) dτ = W1 + W2 + ϵ0 ∫ E1 · E2 dτ. (2.47) For example, if you double the charge everywhere, you quadruple the total energy. Problem 2.37. Consider two concentric spherical shells, of radii a and b. Suppose the inner one carries a charge q,and theouter oneacharge −q (both of them uniformly distributed over the surface). Calculate the energy of this configuration, (a) using Eq. 2.45, and (b) using Eq. 2.47 and the results of Ex. 2.9. Problem 2.38. Find the interaction energy (ϵ0 ∫ E1 · E2 dτ in Eq. 2.47) for two point charges, q1 and q2, a distance a apart. [Hint: Put q1 at the origin and q2 on the z-axis; use spherical coordinates, and do the r integral first.] 12 Ever since Maxwell, physicists have agonized over the “location” of electrostatic energy. Feynman, in his inimitable way, lays the matter to rest: “Who cares? What’s the meaning of such a question? … If we restrict ourselves to electrostatics there is really no way to tell where the energy is located.” R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 2, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1967), Chap. 8, p. 8. 95 2.5 Conductors 2.5 Conductors 2.5.1 Basic Properties In an insulator, such as glass or rubber, each electron is on a short leash, attached to a particular atom. In a metallic conductor, by contrast, one or more electrons per atom are free to roam. (In liquid conductors such as salt water, it is ions that do the moving.) A perfect conductor would contain an unlimited supply of free charges. In real life there are no perfect conductors, but metals come pretty close, for most purposes. From this definition, the basic electrostatic properties of ideal conduc- tors immediately follow: (i) E = 0 inside a conductor. Why? Because if there were any field, those free charges would move, and it wouldn’t be electrostatics any more. Hmm … that’s hardly a satisfactory explanation; maybe all it proves is that you can’t have electrostatics when conductors are present. We had better examine what happens when you put a conductor into an external electric field E0 (Fig. 2.42). Initially, the field will drive any free positive charges to the right, and negative ones to the left. (In practice, it’s the negative charges – electrons – that do the moving, but when they depart, the right-hand side is left with a net positive charge – the stationary nuclei – so it doesn’t really matter which charges move; the effect is the same.) When they come to the edge of the material, the charges pile up: plus on the right-hand side, minus on the left. Now, these induced charges produce a field of their own, E1, which, as you can see from the figure, is in the opposite direction to E0. That’s the crucial point, for it means that the field of the induced charges tends to cancel the original field. Charge will continue to flow until this cancelation is complete, and the resultant field inside the conductor is precisely zero.13 The whole process is practically instantaneous.

This follows from Gauss’s law: ∇ · E = ρ/ϵ0. If E is zero, so also is ρ. There is still charge around, but exactly as much plus as minus, so the net charge density in the interior is zero. (iii) Any net charge resides on the surface. That’s the only place left. (iv) A conductor is an equipotential. For if a and b are any two points within (or at the surface of) a given conductor, V (b)−V (a) = − ∫ b a E·dl = 0, and hence V (a) = V (b). (v) E is perpendicular to the surface, just outside a conductor. Otherwise, as in (i), charge will immediately flow around the surface until it kills off the tangential component (Fig. 2.43). (Perpendicular to the surface, charge cannot flow, of course, since it is confined to the conducting object.) I think it is astonishing that the charge on a conductor flows to the surface. Because of their mutual repulsion, the charges naturally spread out as much as possible, but for all of them to go to the surface seems like a waste of the interior space. Surely we could do better, from the point of view of making each charge as far as possible from its neighbors, to sprinkle some of them throughout the volume …. Well, it simply is not so. You do best to put all the charge on the surface, and this is true regardless of the size or shape of the conductor.14 The problem can also be phrased in terms of energy. Like any other free dynamical system, the charge on a conductor will seek the con- figuration that minimizes its potential energy. Property (iii) asserts that the electrostatic energy of a solid object (with specified shape and total charge) is a minimum when that charge is spread over the surface. For instance, the energy of a sphere is (1/8πϵ0)(q 2/R) if the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface, as we found in Ex. 2.9, but it is greater, (3/20πϵ0)(q 2/R), if the charge is uniformly distributed throughout the volume (Prob. 2.35). 14 By the way, the one- and two-dimensional analogs are quite different: The charge on a conducting disk does not all go to the perimeter (R. Friedberg, Am.J.Phys. 61, 1084 (1993)), nor does the charge on a conducting needle go to the two ends (D. J. Griffiths and Y. Li, Am.J.Phys. 64, 706 (1996)) – see Prob. 2.58. Moreover, if the exponent of r in Coulomb’s law were not precisely 2, the charge on a solid conductor would not all go to the surface – see D. J. Griffiths and D. Z. Uvanovic, Am. J. Phys. 69, 435 (2001), and Prob. 2.55g. 97 2.5 Conductors \u0004q Conductor\u0002\u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 Fig. 2.44 \u0004 Gaussian surface Conductor q E \u0005\u00030 E \u0006\u00030 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0002 \u0002 \u0004 \u0004 Fig. 2.45 2.5.2 Induced Charges If you hold a charge +q near an uncharged spherical conductor (Fig. 2.44), the two will attract one another. The reason for this is that q will pull minus charges over to the near side and repel plus charges to the far side. (Another way to think of it is that the charge moves around in such a way as to kill off the field of q for points inside the conductor, where the total field must be zero.) Since the negative induced charge is closer to q, there is a net force of attraction. (In Chapter 3 we shall calculate this force explicitly, for the case of a spherical conductor.) When I speak of the field, charge, or potential “inside” a conductor, I mean in the “meat” of the conductor; if there is some hollow cavity in the conductor, and within that cavity you put some charge, then the field in the cavity will not be zero. But in a remarkable way the cavity and its contents are electrically isolated from the outside world by the surrounding conductor (Fig. 2.45). No external fields penetrate the conductor; they are canceled at the outer surface by the induced charge there. Similarly, the field due to charges within the cavity is canceled, for all exterior points, by the induced charge on the inner surface. However, the compensating charge left over on the outer surface of the conductor effectively “communicates” the presence of q to the outside world. The total charge induced on the cavity wall is equal and opposite to the charge inside, for if we surround the cavity with a Gaussian surface, all points of which are in the conductor (Fig. 2.45), ∮ E · da = 0, and hence (by Gauss’s law) the net enclosed charge must be zero. But Qenc = q + qinduced,so qinduced = −q. And if the conductor as a whole is electrically neutral, there must be a charge +q on its outer surface. Example 2.10. An uncharged spherical conductor, centered at the ori- gin, has a cavity of some weird shape carved out of it (Fig. 2.46). Some- where within the cavity is a charge q. Question: What is the field outside the sphere? 98 2Electrostatics Conductor P Cavity −q +q q r Fig. 2.46 Solution. At first glance, it would appear that the answer depends on the shape of the cavity and the location of the charge. But that’s wrong: the answer is E = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 ˆr regardless. The conductor conceals from us all information concern- ing the nature of the cavity, revealing only the total charge it con- tains. How can this be? Well, the charge +q induces an opposite charge −q on the wall of the cavity, which distributes itself in such a way that its field cancels that of q, for all points exterior to the cavity. Since the conductor carries no net charge, this leaves +q to distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere. (It’s uni- form because the asymmetrical influence of the point charge +q is negated by that of the induced charge −q on the inner surface.) For points outside the sphere, then, the only thing that survives is the field of the leftover +q, uniformly distributed over the outer surface. It may occur to you that in one respect this argument is open to challenge: There are actually three fields at work here: Eq, Einduced,and Eleftover. All we know for certain is that the sum of the three is zero inside the conductor, yet I claimed that the first two alone cancel, while the third is separately zero there. Moreover, even if the first two cancel within the conductor, who is to say they still cancel for points outside? They do not, after all, cancel for points inside the cavity. I cannot give you a completely satisfactory answer at the moment, but this much at least is true: There exists a way of distributing −q over the inner surfacesoastocancel thefieldof q at all points exterior to the cavity. For that same cavity could have been carved out of a huge spherical conductor with a radius of 27 miles, or light years, or whatever. In that case, the leftover +q on the outer surface is simply too far away to produce a significant field, and the other two fields would have to accomplish the cancelation by themselves. So we know they can do it … but are we sure they choose to? Perhaps for small spheres nature 99 2.5 Conductors prefers some complicated three-way cancelation. Nope: As we’ll see in the uniqueness theorems of Chapter 3, electrostatics is very stingy with its options; there is always precisely one way – no more – of distributing the charge on a conductor so as to make the field inside zero. Having found a possible way, we are guaranteed that no alternative exists, even in principle. If a cavity surrounded by conducting material is itself empty of charge, then the field within the cavity is zero. For any field line would have to begin and end on the cavity wall, going from a plus charge to a minus charge (Fig. 2.47). Letting that field line be part of a closed loop, the rest of which is entirely inside the conductor (where E = 0), the integral ∮ E · dl is distinctly positive, in violation of Eq. 2.19. It follows that E = 0 within an empty cavity, and there is in fact no charge on the surface of the cavity. (This is why you are relatively safe inside a metal car during a thunderstorm – you may get cooked, if lightning strikes, but you will not be electrocuted. The same principle applies to the placement of sensitive apparatus inside a grounded Faraday cage, to shield out stray electric fields. In practice, the enclosure doesn’t even have to be a solid conductor – chicken wire will often suffice.) \u0004 \u0002 Fig. 2.47 Problem 2.39. A metal sphere of radius R,carryingcharge q, is surrounded by a thick concentric metal shell (inner radius a, outer radius b,asin Fig. 2.48). The shell carries no net charge. (a) Find the surface charge density σ at R,at a,and at b. (b) Find the potential at the center, using infinity as the reference point. (c) Now the outer surface is touched to a grounding wire, which drains off charge and lowers its potential to zero (same as at infinity). How do your answers to (a) and (b) change? Problem 2.40. Two spherical cavities, of radii a and b, are hollowed out from the interior of a (neutral) conducting sphere of radius R (Fig. 2.49).

(b) What is the field outside the conductor? 100 2Electrostatics (c) What is the field within each cavity? (d) What is the force on qa and qb? (e) Which of these answers would change if a third charge, qc, were brought near the conductor (but outside it)? R a b Fig. 2.48 qaa R qb b Fig. 2.49 Problem 2.41. (a) A point charge q is inside a cavity in an uncharged conductor (Fig. 2.45). Is the force on q necessarily zero?15 (b) Is the force between a point charge and a nearby uncharged conductor always attractive?16 2.5.3 Surface Charge and the Force on a Conductor Because the field inside a conductor is zero, Eq. 2.33 requires that the field immediately outside is E = σ ϵ0 ˆn, (2.48) consistent with our earlier conclusion that the field is normal to the surface. In terms of potential, Eq. 2.36 yields σ = −ϵ0 ∂V ∂n . (2.49) These equations enable you to calculate the surface charge on a conductor, if you can determine E or V ; we shall use them frequently in the next chapter. In the presence of an electric field, any surface charge will experience a force; the force per unit area, f,is σE. But there’s a problem here, for the electric field is discontinuous at a surface charge, so what are we supposed to use: Eabove, Ebelow, or something in between? The answer is that we should use the average of the two: f = σEaverage = 1 2 σ(Eabove + Ebelow). (2.50) 15 This problem was suggested by Nelson Christensen. 16 See M. Levin and S. G. Johnson, Am.J.Phys. 79, 843 (2011). 101 2.5 Conductors Eother Patch n 1 2 σ/ 0 1 2 ϵ ϵ σ/ 0ϵ ˆ Fig. 2.50 Why the average? The reason is very simple, though the telling makes it sound complicated: Let’s focus our attention on a tiny patch of surface surrounding the point in question (Fig. 2.50). (Make it small enough so it is essentially flat and the surface charge on it essentially constant.) The total field consists of two parts – that attributable to the patch itself, and that due to everything else (other regions of the surface, as well as any external sources that may be present): E = Epatch + Eother. Now, the patch cannot exert a force on itself, any more than you can lift yourself by standing in a basket and pulling up on the handles. The force on the patch, then, is due exclusively to Eother,and this suffers no discontinuity (if we removed the patch, the field in the “hole” would be perfectly smooth). The discontinuity is due entirely to the charge on the patch, which puts out afield(σ/2ϵ0) on either side, pointing away from the surface. Thus, Eabove = Eother + σ 2ϵ0 ˆn, Ebelow = Eother − σ 2ϵ0 ˆn, and hence Eother = 1 2 (Eabove + Ebelow) = Eaverage. Averaging is really just a device for removing the contribution of the patch itself. That argument applies to any surface charge; in the particular case of a conductor, the field is zero inside and (σ/ϵ0)ˆn outside (Eq. 2.48), so the average is (σ/2ϵ0)ˆn, and the force per unit area is f = 1 2ϵ0 σ2ˆn. (2.51) This amounts to an outward electrostatic pressure on the surface, tending to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of σ. Expressing the pressure in terms of the field just outside the surface, P = ϵ0 2 E2. (2.52) 102 2Electrostatics Problem 2.42. Two large metal plates (each of area A) are held a small distance d apart. Suppose we put a charge Q on each plate; what is the electrostatic pressure on the plates? Problem 2.43. A metal sphere of radius R carries a total charge Q. What is the force of repulsion between the “northern”hemisphere and the “southern”hemisphere? 2.5.4 Capacitors Suppose we have two conductors, and we put charge +Q on one and −Q on the other (Fig. 2.51). Since V is constant over a conductor, we can speak unambiguously of the potential difference between them: V = V+ − V− = − ∫ (+) (−) E · dl. We don’t know how the charge distributes itself over the two conductors, and calculating the field would be a nightmare if their shapes are compli- cated, but this much we do know: E is proportional to Q,for E is given by Coulomb’s law: E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ 2 ˆ dτ, so if you double ρ, you double E. [Wait a minute! How do we know that doubling Q (and also −Q) simply doubles ρ? Maybe the charge moves around into a completely different configuration, quadrupling ρ in some places and halving it in others, just so the total charge on each conductor is doubled. The fact is that this concern is unwarranted – doubling Q does double ρ everywhere; it doesn’t shift the charge around. The proof of this will come in Chapter 3; for now you’ll just have to trust me.] Since E is proportional to Q,soalsois V . The constant of proportion- ality is called the capacitance of the arrangement: C ≡ Q V . (2.53) Capacitance is a purely geometrical quantity, determined by the sizes, shapes, and separation of the two conductors. In SI units, C is measured in farads (F); a farad is a coulomb-per-volt. Actually, this turns out to be inconveniently large; more practical units are the microfarad (10 −6 F) and the picofarad (10 −12 F). \u0004Q \u0002Q Fig. 2.51 103 2.5 Conductors Notice that V is, by definition, the potential of the positive conductor minus that of the negative one; likewise, Q is the charge on the positive conductor. Accordingly, capacitance is an intrinsically positive quantity. (By the way, you will occasionally hear someone speak of the capacitance of a single conductor. In this case the “second conductor,” with the negative charge, is an imaginary spherical shell of infinite radius surrounding the one conductor. It contributes nothing to the field, so the capacitance is given by Eq. 2.53,where V is the potential with infinity as the reference point.) Example 2.11. Find the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor con- sisting of two metal surfaces of area A held a distance d apart (Fig. 2.52). d A Fig. 2.52 Solution. If we put +Q on the top and −Q on the bottom, they will spread out uniformly over the two surfaces, provided the area is reasonably large and the separation small. 17 The surface charge density, then, is σ = Q/A on the top plate, and so the field, according to Ex. 2.6,is (1/ϵ0)Q/A. The potential difference between the plates is therefore V = Q Aϵ0 d, and hence C = Aϵ0 d . (2.54) If, for instance, the plates are square, with sides 1 cm long, and they are held 1 mm apart, then the capacitance is 9 × 10 −13 F. Example 2.12. Find the capacitance of two concentric spherical metal shells, with radii a and b. Solution. Place charge +Q on the inner sphere, and −Q on the outer one. The field between the spheres is E = 1 4πϵ0 Q r2 ˆr, 17 The exact solution is not easy – even for the simpler case of circular plates. See G. T. Carlson andB.L.Illman, Am.J.Phys. 62, 1099 (1994). 104 2Electrostatics so the potential difference between them is V = − ∫ a b E · dl = − Q 4πϵ0 ∫ a b 1 r2 dr = Q 4πϵ0 ( 1 a − 1 b ). As promised, V is proportional to Q; the capacitance is C = Q V = 4πϵ0 ab (b − a) . To “charge up” a capacitor, you have to remove electrons from the positive plate and carry them to the negative plate. In doing so, you fight against the electric field, which is pulling them back toward the positive conductor and pushing them away from the negative one. How much work does it take, then, to charge the capacitor up to a final amount Q? Suppose that at some intermediate stage in the process the charge on the positive plate is q, so that the potential difference is q/C. According to Eq. 2.38,the work you must do to transport the next piece of charge, dq,is dW = ( q C ) dq. The total work necessary, then, to go from q = 0to q = Q,is W = ∫ Q 0 ( q C ) dq = 1 2 Q 2 C , or, since Q = CV , W = 1 2 CV 2, (2.55) where V is the final potential of the capacitor. Problem 2.44. Find the capacitance per unit length of two coaxial metal cylindrical tubes, of radii a and b (Fig. 2.53). b a Fig. 2.53 Problem 2.45.

(This problem is supposed to be easy, but it contains the embryo of an alternative derivation of Eq. 2.52, using conservation of energy.) More Problems on Chapter 2 Problem 2.46.

(b) Show that the equipotential surfaces are circular cylinders, and locate the axis and radius of the cylinder corresponding to a given potential V0. ! Problem 2.54. In a vacuum diode, electrons “boil” off a hot cathode, at potential zero, and accelerate across a gap to the anode, which is held at positive potential V0. The cloud of moving electrons within the gap (called space charge) quickly builds up to the point where it reduces the field at the surface of the cathode to zero. From then on, a steady current I flows between the plates. Suppose the plates are large relative to the separation (A ≫ d2 in Fig. 2.55), so that edge effects can be neglected. Then V, ρ,and v (the speed of the electrons) are all functions of x alone. x A Electron Cathode (V = 0) Anode (V0) d Fig. 2.55 (a) Write Poisson’s equation for the region between the plates.

(f) Show that I = KV 3/2 0 , (2.56) 107 More Problems on Chapter 2 and find the constant K.(Equation 2.56 is called the Child–Langmuir law.Itholds for other geometries as well, whenever space charge limits the current. Notice that the space- charge-limited diode is nonlinear – it does not obey Ohm’s law.) ! Problem 2.55. Imagine that new and extraordinarily precise measurements have revealed an error in Coulomb’s law. The actual force of interaction between two point charges is found to be F = 1 4πϵ0 q1q2 2 (1 + λ )e−( /λ) ˆ, where λ is a new constant of nature (it has dimensions of length, obviously, and is a huge number – say half the radius of the known Universe – so the correction is small, which is why no one ever noticed the discrepancy before). You are charged with the task of reformulating electrostatics to accommodate the new discovery. Assume the principle of superposition still holds. (a) What is the electric field of a charge distribution ρ (replacing Eq. 2.8)? (b) Does this electric field admit a scalar potential? Explain briefly how you reached your conclusion.

Use ∞ as your reference point. (d) For a point charge q at the origin, show that ∮ S E · da + 1 λ2 ∫ V Vdτ = 1 ϵ0 q, where S is the surface and V the volume of any sphere centered at q. (e) Show that this result generalizes: ∮ S E · da + 1 λ2 ∫ V Vdτ = 1 ϵ0 Qenc, for any charge distribution. (This is the next best thing to Gauss’s law, in the new “electrostatics.”) (f) Draw the triangle diagram (like Fig. 2.35) for this world, putting in all the appropriate formulas. (Think of Poisson’s equation as the formula for ρ in terms of V,andGauss’slaw (differential form) as an equation for ρ in terms of E.) (g) Show that some of the charge on a conductor distributes itself (uniformly!) over the volume, with the remainder on the surface. [Hint: E is still zero, inside a conductor.] Problem 2.56. Suppose an electric field E(x, y, z) has the form Ex = ax, Ey = 0, Ez = 0, where a is a constant. What is the charge density? How do you account for the fact that the field points in a particular direction, when the charge density is uniform? [This is a more subtle problem than it looks, and worthy of careful thought.] 108 2Electrostatics Problem 2.57. All of electrostatics follows from the 1/r2 character of Coulomb’s law, together with the principle of superposition. An analogous theory can therefore be constructed for Newton’s law of universal gravitation. What is the gravitational energy of a sphere, of mass M and radius R, assuming the density is uniform? Use your result to estimate the gravitational energy of the Sun (look up the relevant numbers). Note that the energy is negative – masses attract, whereas (like) electric charges repel. As matter “falls in,” to create the Sun, its kinetic energy is converted into other forms (typically thermal), and is eventually released as radiation. The Sun radiates at a rate of 3.86 × 1026 W; if all this came from gravitational energy, how long would the Sun last? [The Sun is in fact much older than that, so evidently this is not the source of its energy.18] ! Problem 2.58. We know that the charge on a conductor goes to the surface, but just how it distributes itself there is not easy to determine. One famous example in which the surface charge density can be calculated explicitly is the ellipsoid: x2 a2 + y2 b2 + z2 c2 = 1. In this case,19 σ = Q 4πabc ( x2 a4 + y2 b4 + z2 c4 ) −1/2, (2.57) where Q is the total charge. By choosing appropriate values for a, b,and c, obtain (from Eq. 2.57) (a) the net (both sides) surface charge density σ(r) on a circular disk of radius R; (b) the net surface charge density σ(x) on an infinite conducting “ribbon” in the xy plane, which straddles the y-axis from x = −a to x = a (let Λ be the total charge per unit length of ribbon); (c) the net charge per unit length λ(x) on a conducting “needle,” running from x = −a to x = a. In each case, sketch the graph of your result. Problem 2.59. (a) Consider an equilateral triangle, inscribed in a circle of radius a, with a point charge q at each vertex. The electric field is zero (obviously) at the center, but (surprisingly) there are three other points inside the triangle where the field is zero. Where are they? [Answer: r = 0.285a – you’ll probably need a computer to get it.] (b) For a regular n-sided polygon there are n points (in addition to the center) where the field is zero.20 Find their distance from the center for n = 4 and n = 5. What do you suppose happens as n →∞? 18 Lord Kelvin used this argument to counter Darwin’s theory of evolution, which called for a much older Earth. Of course, we now know that the source of the Sun’s energy is nuclear fusion, not gravity. 19 For the derivation (which is a real tour de force), see W. R. Smythe, Static and Dynamic Electricity, 3rd ed., Hemisphere, New York (1989), Sect. 5.02. 20 S. D. Baker, Am.J.Phys. 52, 265 (1984); D. Kiang and D. A. Tindall, Am.J.Phys. 53, 593 (1985). 109 More Problems on Chapter 2 Problem 2.60. Prove or disprove (with a counterexample) the following: Theorem. Suppose a conductor carrying a net charge Q,whenplacedinanexternal electric field Ee, experiences a force F; if the external field is now reversed (Ee →−Ee), the force also reverses (F →−F). What if we stipulate that the external field is uniform? Problem 2.61. A point charge q is at the center of an uncharged spherical conducting shell, of inner radius a and outer radius b. Question: How much work would it take to move the charge out to infinity (through a tiny hole drilled in the shell)? [Answer: (q2/8πϵ0)(1/a − 1/b).] Problem 2.62. What is the minimum-energy configuration for a system of N equal point charges placed on or inside a circle of radius R?21 Because the charge on a conductor goes to the surface, you might think the N charges would arrange themselves (uniformly) around the circumference. Show (to the contrary) that for N = 12 it is better to place 11 on the circumference and 1 at the center. How about for N = 11 (is the energy lower if you put all 11 around the circumference, or if you put 10 on the circumference and 1 at the center)? [Hint: Do it numerically – you’ll need at least 4 significant digits. Express all energies as multiples of q2/4πϵ0R.] ! Problem 2.63. (a) Find the potential on the rim of a uniformly charged circular disk of radius r and charge density σ.[Hint: Chop the disk into circular arcs of radius and width d , running from −θ to +θ, and integrate over θ.] (b) Use your result in (a) to calculate the energy of a uniformly charged disk of radius R and total charge Q. (c) A circular conducting disk of radius R carries a total charge Q.In Prob. 2.58a you showed that the charge density is σ(r) = Q 2πR 1 √ R2 − r2 . Find the potential of the disk. (d) Use your result in (c) to calculate the energy of a conducting disk of radius R and total charge Q. Compare your answer to (b); which is smaller, and why?22 Problem 2.64. Many programming languages include packages for drawing field diagrams (like Fig. 2.12a). You input E(x, y, z), and the program generates a figure showing arrows representing the field at an array of representative points. In Mathematica it’s called Vec- torPlot. Suppose, for example, you want to sketch the field of a point charge q at the origin; in the xy plane the field is 21 M. G. Calkin, D. Kiang, and D. A. Tindall, Am.J.Phys. 55, 157 (1987). 22 For applications of these results see T. M. Minteer, Eur. J. Phys. 35, 035022 (2014). 110 2Electrostatics E = q 4πϵ0 ˆr r2 = q 4πϵ0 r r3 = q 4πϵ0 xˆx + yˆy (x2 + y2)3/2 , so, setting q/4πϵ0 → 1 and using the Mathematica syntax for defining a function, you type in EF[{x_,y_}] := {x,y}/((xˆ2 + yˆ2)ˆ(3/2)) and invoke VectorPlot[EF[{x,y}], {x,-1,1}, {y,-1,1}] (the terms in curly brackets specify the region of interest: −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and −1 ≤ y ≤ 1). (a) Try it. If you want to change the number of arrows drawn (say, to 10 per row/column), type VectorPlot[EF[{x,y}], {x,-1,1}, {y,-1,1}, VectorPoints->10] Notice that in Mathematica the strength of the field is represented by the color of the arrows; if you prefer to indicate it by their length, insert (after a comma, as always) VectorScaling->Automatic; to turn off the color coding altogether, also insert VectorColorFunction->None.Ifyou want to draw in the x-and y-axes, insert Axes->True. Construct field diagrams for two charges, equal (as in Fig. 2.14), and opposite (as in Fig. 2.13). (b) Mathematica can also draw the full three-dimensional field pattern, using VectorPlot3D[EF[{x,y,z}], {x,-1,1}, {y,-1,1}, {z,-1,1}, VectorScaling->Automatic] Try it, for the field of a point charge at the origin. The result is rather congested; I prefer to insert VectorMarkers->Arrow, which makes it a little easier to read. Problem 2.65. In Prob. 2.64 you drew field vectors at representative points; suppose instead you want to construct a field line passing through the point (x0, y0).InMathematica youcan do it using StreamPlot: StreamPlot[EF[{x, y}], {x, −1, 1}, {y, −1, 1}, StreamPoints->{{x0, y0 }}, StreamScale->Full, Axes->True] (a) For a point charge at the origin, draw the field line passing through (0.5, 0.5). (b) Draw a typical field line for the configurations in Figs. 2.13 and 2.14. (c) If you change the argument of StreamPoints to a number (for instance, writing StreamPoints->20), StreamPlot will draw 20 representative field lines. Try it for the configurations in part (b). Problem 2.66. In Prob. 2.65 we used StreamPlot to draw electric field lines in two dimensions; it’s quick and easy, but it doesn’t tell you what the computer is actually doing.The basic idea is very simple: to get from one point on a field line (r(t)) to the next (r(t + dt)), you take a short step in the direction of the field: r(t + dt) = r(t) + E(r(t)) dt. 111 More Problems on Chapter 2 Here t is any convenient parameter – perhaps arc length – that increases monotonically along the curve. In the limit of infinitesimal step size, dr dt = E. This is an ordinary first-order differential equation for r(t), and Mathematica can solve it (numerically) using NDSolve. First specify your electric field (EF), as in Prob. 2.64.Next, instruct the computer to calculate the coordinates (x(t), y(t), z(t)) of the field line: FieldLine = NDSolve[{ x’[t]==EF[{x[t],y[t],z[t]}][[1]], y’[t]==EF[{x[t],y[t],z[t]}][[2]], z’[t]==EF[{x[t],y[t],z[t]}][[3]], x[0]==x0,y[0]==y0,z[0]==z0},{x,y,z},{t,0,tmax}]; In the last line you will insert appropriate numbers for the starting point (x0,y0,z0), and choose how far out (tmax) you want to go. Finally, to draw the field line, type ParametricPlot3D[{x[t],y[t],z[t]}/.FieldLine,{t,0,tmax}] Beware: If the field line wanders too close to a point charge, where the field is huge and rapidly changing, the numerical solution may be unstable, and you’ll either get an error message or the plot will develop weird kinks. (a) Tomakesurethecodeisworking,reproducethefiguresfrom Prob. 2.65a and b (but now in three dimensions). You might start out with tmax = 10, but be prepared to adjust it as necessary. (b) The field lines in part (a) all lie in a plane. Construct an electric field line that does not lie in a plane, using a configuration of three point charges. Problem 2.67. A point charge q of mass m movesinanelectricfield E(x, y, z).Itstarts out at x0 = (x0, y0, z0), with velocity v0 = (vx0, vy0, vz0), and you want to determine its trajectory. The following Mathematica code will do the job: Etraj[x0_, v0_, m_, q_, dt_, n_, EF_] := Module[{X, V, x, v, xprev, j}, X = Table[0., {i, 1, n}]; X[[1]] = x0; V = Table[0., {i, 1, n}]; V[[1]] = v0; x=x0; v=v0; For[j=2,j<=n,j=j+1, xprev = x; x = x + v dt + 1/(2m) q EF[x] dtˆ2; v = 1/(2m) (q EF[xprev] + q EF[x]) dt; X[[j]] = x; V[[j]] = v; ]; Return[{X, V}]; ] ShowTrajectory[pts_] := Show[Graphics3D[Table[Line[{pts[[jj]], pts[[jj+1]]}], {jj, 1, Length[pts]-1}]]] 112 2Electrostatics (a) Etraj takes as input the vectors x0 and v0,the values q, m, dt, n, and the electric field EF; it returns two lists: X (the position of the charge) and V (its velocity), at a succession of n times, separated by small intervals dt. The crucial steps are x = x + v dt + 1/(2m) q EF[x] dtˆ2; v = v + 1/(2m) (q EF[xprev] + q EF[x]) dt; Explain what they do. To generate the plot, you type {X1,V1} = Etraj[...]; ShowTrajectory[X1] (b) As an example, suppose the field is produced by a (negative) point charge Q at the origin. This is mathematically identical to the classical Kepler problem; the trajectories are ellipses (if the total energy – kinetic plus potential – is negative), hyperbolic (if the energy is positive), and parabolic (if it is zero). Generate an example of each case. (You might as well set q = 1, m = 1,and Q/4πϵ0 = −1.) (c) For something a little more exotic, try two (equal, negative) source charges, at (±0.5, 0, 0);start q at the origin, with initial velocity v = (1.02, 1.10, 0), and set dt = 1/20,000, n = 32,000. 3 Potentials 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 3.1.1 Introduction The primary task of electrostatics is to find the electric field of a given stationary charge distribution. In principle, this purpose is accomplished by Coulomb’s law, in the form of Eq. 2.8: E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ˆ 2 ρ(r′) dτ′. (3.1) Unfortunately, integrals of this type can be difficult to calculate for any but the simplest charge configurations. Occasionally we can get around this by exploiting symmetry and using Gauss’s law, but ordinarily the best strategy is first to calculate the potential, V , which is given by the somewhat more tractable Eq. 2.29: V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 1 ρ(r′) dτ′. (3.2) Still, even this integral is often too tough to handle analytically. Moreover, in problems involving conductors, ρ itself may not be known in advance; since charge is free to move around, the only thing we control directly is the total charge (or perhaps the potential) of each conductor. In such cases, it is fruitful to recast the problem in differential form, using Poisson’s equation (2.24), ∇ 2V = − 1 ϵ0 ρ, (3.3) which, together with appropriate boundary conditions, is equivalent to Eq. 3.2. Very often, in fact, we are interested in finding the potential in a region where ρ = 0. (If ρ = 0 everywhere, of course, then V = 0, and there is nothing further to say – that’s not what I mean. There may be plenty of charge elsewhere, but we’re confining our attention to places where there is no charge.) In this case, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation: ∇2V = 0, (3.4) or, written out in Cartesian coordinates, ∂2V ∂x2 + ∂2V ∂y2 + ∂2V ∂z2 = 0. (3.5) 114 3 Potentials This formula is so fundamental to the subject that one might almost say electrostatics is the study of Laplace’s equation. At the same time, it is a ubiquitous equation, appearing in such diverse branches of physics as gravitation and magnetism, the theory of heat, and the study of soap bubbles. In mathematics, it plays a major role in analytic function theory. To get a feel for Laplace’s equation and its solutions (which are called harmonic functions), we shall begin with the one- and two-dimensional versions, which are easier to picture, and illustrate all the essential properties of the three-dimensional case. 3.1.2 Laplace’s Equation in One Dimension Suppose V depends on only one variable, x. Then Laplace’s equation becomes d2V dx2 = 0. The general solution is V (x) = mx + b, (3.6) the equation for a straight line. It contains two undetermined constants (m and b), as is appropriate for a second-order (ordinary) differential equation. They are determined, in any particular case, by the boundary conditions of that problem. For instance, it might be specified that V = 4at x = 1, and V = 0at x = 5. In that case, m = −1and b = 5, so V = −x + 5(Fig. 3.1). I want to call your attention to two features of this result; they may seem silly and obvious in one dimension, where I can write down the general solution explicitly, but the analogs in two and three dimensions are powerful and by no means obvious: (1) V (x) is the average of V (x + a) and V (x − a), for any a: V (x) = 1 2 [V (x + a) + V (x − a)]. Laplace’s equation is a kind of averaging instruction; it tells you to assign to the point x the average of the values to the left and to the right of x. Solutions to Laplace’s equation are, in this sense, as boring as they could possibly be, and yet fit the end points properly. x V 1 1 2 3456 2 3 4 Fig. 3.1 115 3.1 Laplace’s Equation (2) Laplace’s equation tolerates no local maxima or minima; extreme values of V must occur at the end points. Actually, this is a consequence of item (1), for if there were a local maximum, V would be greater at that point than on either side, and therefore could not be the average. (Ordinarily, you expect the second derivative to be negative at a maximum and positive at a minimum. Since Laplace’s equation requires, on the contrary, that the second derivative is zero, it seems reasonable that solutions should exhibit no extrema. However, this is not a proof, since there exist functions that have maxima and minima at points where the second derivative vanishes: x 4, for example, at the point x = 0.) 3.1.3 Laplace’s Equation in Two Dimensions If V depends on two variables, Laplace’s equation becomes ∂2V ∂x2 + ∂2V ∂y2 = 0. This is no longer an ordinary differential equation (that is, one involving ordinary derivatives only); it’s a partial differential equation. As a conse- quence, some of the simple rules you may be familiar with do not apply. For instance, the general solution to this equation doesn’t contain just two arbitrary constants – or, for that matter, any finite number – despite the fact that it’s a second-order equation. Indeed, one cannot write down a “general solution” (at least, not in a closed form like Eq. 3.6). Nevertheless, it is possible to deduce certain properties common to all solutions. It may help to have a physical example in mind. Picture a thin rubber sheet (or a soap film) stretched over some support. For definiteness, suppose you take a cardboard box, cut a wavy line all the way around, and remove the top part (Fig. 3.2). Now glue a tightly stretched rubber membrane over the box, so that it fits like a drum head (it won’t be a flat drumhead, of course, unless you chose to cut the edges off straight). Now, if you lay out coordinates (x, y) on the bottom of the box, the height V (x, y) of the sheet above the point (x, y) will satisfy Laplace’s equation.1 (The one- dimensional analog would be a rubber band stretched between two points. Of course, it would form a straight line.) Harmonic functions in two dimensions have the same properties we noted in one dimension: (1) The value of V at a point (x, y) is the average of those around the point. More precisely, if you draw a circle of any radius R about the 1 Actually, the equation satisfied by a rubber sheet is ∂ ∂x (g ∂V ∂x ) + ∂ ∂y (g ∂V ∂y ) = 0, where g = [1 + ( ∂V ∂x ) 2 + ( ∂V ∂y ) 2] −1/2; it reduces (approximately) to Laplace’s equation as long as the surface does not deviate too radically from a plane. 116 3 Potentials x y V R Fig. 3.2 point (x, y), the average value of V on the circle is equal to the value at the center: V (x, y) = 1 2πR ∮ circle Vdl. (This, incidentally, suggests the method of relaxation,onwhichmany computer solutions to Laplace’s equation are based: Starting with specified values for V at the boundary, and reasonable guesses for V on a grid of interior points, the first pass reassigns to each point the average of its nearest neighbors. The second pass repeats the process, using the corrected values, and so on. After a few iterations, the numbers begin to settle down, so that subsequent passes produce negligible changes, and a numerical solution to Laplace’s equation, with the given boundary values, has been achieved. 2) (2) V has no local maxima or minima; all extrema occur at the boundaries. (As before, this follows from property 1.) Again, Laplace’s equation picks the most featureless function possible, consistent with the bound- ary conditions: no hills, no valleys, just the smoothest conceivable surface. For instance, if you put a ping-pong ball on the stretched rubber sheet of Fig. 3.2, it will roll over to one side and fall off – it will not find a “pocket” somewhere to settle into, for Laplace’s equation allows no such dents in the surface. From a geometrical point of view, just as a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, so a harmonic function in two dimensions minimizes the surface area spanning the given boundary line. 3.1.4 Laplace’s Equation in Three Dimensions In three dimensions I can neither provide you with an explicit solution (as in one dimension) nor offer a suggestive physical example to guide your intuition (as I did in two dimensions). Nevertheless, the same two properties remain true, and this time I will sketch a proof.3 2 See Prob. 3.65. 3 For a proof that does not rely on Coulomb’s law (only on Laplace’s equation), see Prob. 3.39. 117 3.1 Laplace’s Equation (1) The value of V at point r is the average value of V over a spherical surface of radius R centered at r: V (r) = 1 4πR2 ∮ sphere Vda. (2) As a consequence, V can have no local maxima or minima; the extreme values of V must occur at the boundaries. (For if V had a local maximum at r, then by the very nature of maximum I could draw a sphere around r over which all values of V – and a fortiori the average – would be less than at r.) Proof. Let’s begin by calculating the average potential over a spher- ical surface of radius R due to a single point charge q located outside the sphere. We might as well center the sphere at the origin and choose coordinates so that q lies on the z-axis (Fig. 3.3). The potential at a point on the surface is V = 1 4πϵ0 q , where 2 = z2 + R2 − 2zR cos θ (by the law of cosines), so Vave = 1 4πR2 q 4πϵ0 ∫ [z2 + R2 − 2zR cos θ]−1/2R2 sin θ dθ dφ = q 4πϵ0 1 2zR √z2 + R2 − 2zR cos θ||| π 0 = q 4πϵ0 1 2zR [(z + R) − (z − R)] = 1 4πϵ0 q z . But this is precisely the potential due to q at the center of the sphere! By the superposition principle, the same goes for any collection of charges outside the sphere: their average potential over the sphere is equal to the net potential they produce at the center. □ q z daθ R x y Fig. 3.3 118 3 Potentials Problem 3.1. Find the average potential over a spherical surface of radius R due to a point charge q located inside (same as above, in other words, only with z < R). (In this case, of course, Laplace’s equation does not hold within the sphere.) Show that, in general, Vave = Vcenter + Qenc 4πϵ0R , where Vcenter is the potential at the center due to all the external charges, and Qenc is the total enclosed charge. Problem 3.2. In one sentence, justify Earnshaw’s theorem: A charged particle cannot be held in stable equilibrium (in otherwise empty space) by electrostatic forces alone. As an example, consider the cubical arrangement of eight fixed charges in Fig. 3.4.It looks, off hand, as though a positive charge at the center would be suspended in midair, since it is repelled away from each corner. Where is the leak in this “electrostatic bottle”? [To harness nuclear fusion as a practical energy source it is necessary to heat a plasma (soup of charged particles) to fantastic temperatures – so hot that contact would vaporize any ordinary pot. Earnshaw’s theorem says that electrostatic containment is also out of the question. Fortunately, it is possible to confine a hot plasma magnetically.] q qq q q qq q Fig. 3.4 Problem 3.3. Find the general solution to Laplace’s equation in spherical coordinates, for the case where V depends only on r. Do the same for cylindrical coordinates, assuming V depends only on s. Problem 3.4. (a) Show that the average electric field over a spherical surface, due to charges outside the sphere, is the same as the field at the center. (b) What is the average due to charges inside the sphere? 3.1.5 Boundary Conditions and Uniqueness Theorems Laplace’s equation does not by itself determine V ; in addition, suitable boundary conditions must be imposed. This raises a delicate question: What are appropriate boundary conditions, sufficient to determine the answer and yet not so strong as to generate inconsistencies? The one- dimensional case is easy, for here the general solution V = mx + b contains 119 3.1 Laplace’s Equation two arbitrary constants, and we therefore require two boundary conditions. We might, for instance, specify the value of the function at each end, or we might give the value of the function and its derivative at one end, or the value at one end and the derivative at the other, and so on. But we cannot get away with just the value or just the derivative at one end – this is insufficient information. Nor would it do to specify the derivatives at both ends – this would either be redundant (if the two are equal) or inconsistent (if they are not). In two or three dimensions we are confronted by a partial differen- tial equation, and it is not so obvious what would constitute acceptable boundary conditions. Is the shape of a taut rubber membrane, for instance, uniquely determined by the frame over which it is stretched, or, like a canning jar lid, can it snap from one stable configuration to another? The answer, as I think your intuition would suggest, is that Vis uniquely determined by its value at the boundary (canning jar lids evidently do not obey Laplace’s equation). However, other boundary conditions can also be used (see Prob. 3.5). The proof that a proposed set of boundary conditions will suffice is usually presented in the form of a uniqueness theorem. There are many such theorems for electrostatics, all sharing the same basic format – I’ll show you the two most useful ones. 4 First Uniqueness Theorem. The solution to Laplace’s equation in some volume V is uniquely determined if V is specified on the boundary surface S.5 Proof. In Fig. 3.5 I have drawn such a region and its boundary. (There could also be “islands” inside, so long as V is given on all their surfaces; also, the outer boundary could be at infinity, where V is ordinarily taken to be zero.) Suppose there were two solutions to Laplace’s equation: ∇ 2V1 = 0and ∇ 2V2 = 0, V wanted in this volume ( )V specified on this surface ( ) Fig. 3.5 4 I do not propose to prove the existence of solutions here – that’s a much more difficult job. In context, the existence is generally clear on physical grounds. 5 I’m not saying it is constant over the surface – it may well vary from point to point, but at each point it takes on the specified value. 120 3 Potentials both of which assume the specified value on the surface. I want to prove that they must be equal. The trick is look at their difference: V3 ≡ V1 − V2. This obeys Laplace’s equation, ∇ 2V3 = ∇2V1 −∇ 2V2 = 0, and it takes the value zero on all boundaries (since V1 and V2 are equal there). But Laplace’s equation allows no local maxima or minima – all extrema occur on the boundaries. So the maximum and minimum of V3 are both zero. Therefore V3 must be zero everywhere, and hence V1 = V2. □ Example 3.1. Show that the potential is constant inside an enclosure completely surrounded by a conductor, provided there is no charge within the enclosure. Solution. The potential on the cavity wall is some constant, V0 (that’s item (iv), in Section 2.5.1), so the potential inside is a function that satisfies Laplace’s equation and has the constant value V0 at the boundary. It doesn’t take a genius to think of one solution to this problem: V = V0 everywhere. The uniqueness theorem guarantees that this is the only solution. (It follows that the field inside an empty cavity is zero – the same result we found in Section 2.5.2 on rather different grounds.) The uniqueness theorem is a license to your imagination. It doesn’t matter how you come by your solution; if (a) it satisfies Laplace’s equation and (b) it has the correct value on the boundaries, then it’s right. You’ll see the power of this argument when we come to the method of images. Incidentally, it is easy to improve on the first uniqueness theorem: I assumed there was no charge inside the region in question, so the potential obeyed Laplace’s equation, but we may as well throw in some charge (in which case V obeys Poisson’s equation). The argument is the same, only this time ∇ 2V1 = − 1 ϵ0 ρ, ∇ 2V2 = − 1 ϵ0 ρ, so ∇2V3 = ∇ 2V1 −∇ 2V2 = − 1 ϵ0 ρ + 1 ϵ0 ρ = 0. Once again the difference (V3 ≡ V1 − V2) satisfies Laplace’s equation and has the value zero on all boundaries, so V3 = 0 and hence V1 = V2. Corollary. The potential in a volume V is uniquely determined if (a) the charge density throughout the region, and (b) the value of V on all boundaries, are specified. 121 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 3.1.6 Conductors and the Second Uniqueness Theorem The simplest way to set the boundary conditions for an electrostatic prob- lem is to specify the value of V on all surfaces surrounding the region of interest. And this situation often occurs in practice: In the laboratory, we have conductors connected to batteries, which maintain a given potential, or to ground, which is the experimentalist’s word for V = 0. However, there are other circumstances in which we do not know the potential at the boundary, but rather the charges on various conducting surfaces. Suppose I put charge Qa on the first conductor, Qb on the second, and so on – I’m not telling you how the charge distributes itself over each conducting surface, because as soon as I put it on, it moves around in a way I do not control. And for good measure, let’s say there is some specified charge density ρ in the region between the conductors. Is the electric field now uniquely determined? Or are there perhaps a number of different ways the charges could arrange themselves on their respective conductors, each leading to a different field? Second Uniqueness Theorem. In a volume V surrounded by conduc- tors and containing a specified charge density ρ, the electric field is uniquely determined if the total charge on each conductor is given (Fig. 3.6). (The region as a whole can be bounded by another conductor, or else unbounded.) Proof. Suppose there are two fields satisfying the conditions of the problem. Both obey Gauss’s law in differential form in the space between the conductors: ∇ · E1 = 1 ϵ0 ρ, ∇ · E2 = 1 ϵ0 ρ. And both obey Gauss’s law in integral form for a Gaussian surface enclosing each conductor: ρ specified Integration surfaces Outer boundary – could be at infinity Qd Qb Qa Qc Fig. 3.6 122 3 Potentials ∮ ith conducting surface E1 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qi, ∮ ith conducting surface E2 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qi. Likewise, for the outer boundary (whether this is just inside an enclosing conductor or at infinity), ∮ outer boundary E1 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qtot, ∮ outer boundary E2 · da = 1 ϵ0 Qtot. As before, we examine the difference E3 ≡ E1 − E2, which obeys ∇ · E3 = 0 (3.7) in the region between the conductors, and ∮ E3 · da = 0 (3.8) over each boundary surface. Now there is one final piece of information we must exploit: Although we do not know how the charge Qi distributes itself over the ith conductor, we do know that each conductor is an equipotential, and hence V3 is a constant (not necessarily the same constant) over each conducting surface. (It need not be zero, for the potentials V1 and V2 may not be equal – all we know for sure is that both are constant over any given conductor.) Next comes a trick. Invoking product rule number 5 (inside front cover), we find that ∇ · (V3E3) = V3(∇ · E3) + E3 · (∇V3) = −(E3)2. Here I have used Eq. 3.7,and E3 = − ∇V3. Integrating this over V,and applying the divergence theorem to the left-hand side, ∫ V ∇ · (V3E3) dτ = ∮ S V3E3 · da = − ∫ V(E3)2 dτ. The surface integral covers all boundaries of the region in question – the conductors and outer boundary. Now V3 is a constant over each surface (if the outer boundary is infinity, V3 = 0 there), so it comes outside each integral, and what remains is zero, according to Eq. 3.8. Therefore, ∫ V(E3)2 dτ = 0. But this integrand is never negative; the only way the integral can vanish is if E3 = 0 everywhere. Consequently, E1 = E2, and the theorem is proved. □ 123 3.1 Laplace’s Equation \u0004 \u0002 \u0002 \u0004 Fig. 3.7 \u0004 \u0002 \u0002 \u0004 Fig. 3.8 0 0 0 0 Fig. 3.9 This proof was not easy, and there is a real danger that the theorem itself will seem more plausible to you than the proof. In case you think the second uniqueness theorem is “obvious,” consider this example of Purcell’s: Figure 3.7 shows a simple electrostatic configuration, consisting of four conductors with charges ±Q, situated so that the plusses are near the minuses. It all looks very comfortable. Now, what happens if we join them in pairs, by tiny wires, as indicated in Fig. 3.8? Since the positive charges are very near negative charges (which is where they like to be) you might well guess that nothing will happen – the configuration looks stable. Well, that sounds reasonable, but it’s wrong. The configuration in Fig. 3.8 is impossible. For there are now effectively two conductors, and the total charge on each is zero. One possible way to distribute zero charge over these conductors is to have no accumulation of charge anywhere, and hence zero field everywhere (Fig. 3.9). By the second uniqueness theorem, this must be the solution: the charge will flow down the tiny wires, canceling itself off. Problem 3.5. Prove that the field is uniquely determined when the charge density ρ is given (throughout V)and either V or its normal derivative ∂V /∂n is specified on each boundary surface. [Do not assume the boundaries are conductors, or that V is constant over any given surface. Of course, any stipulated ∂V /∂n must be consistent with Gauss’s law; if, for instance, ∂V /∂n is given on all surfaces, then the charge enclosed by every surface has been stipulated, and it had better be the case that the outer boundary encloses the sum of all the internal charges – otherwise no solution exists at all. You won’t need this fact to solve the problem, but I mention it just in case you are wondering whether any old ∂V /∂n defines a possible configuration; it does not.] Problem 3.6. A more elegant proof of the second uniqueness theorem uses Green’s identity (Prob. 1.61c), with T = U = V3. Supply the details. 124 3 Potentials 3.2 The Method of Images 3.2.1 The Classic Image Problem Suppose a point charge q is held a distance d above an infinite grounded conducting plane (Fig. 3.10). Question: What is the potential in the region above the plane? It’s not just (1/4πϵ0)q/ ,for q will induce a certain amount of negative charge on the nearby surface of the conductor; the total potential is due in part to q directly, and in part to this induced charge. But how can we possibly calculate the potential, when we don’t know how much charge is induced or how it is distributed? From a mathematical point of view, our problem is to solve Poisson’s equation in the region z > 0, with a single point charge q at (0, 0, d), subject to the following boundary conditions: (1) V = 0 when z = 0 (since the conducting plane is grounded), and (2) V → 0 far from the charge (that is, for x 2 + y 2 + z2 ≫ d2). The first uniqueness theorem (actually, its corollary) guarantees that there is only one function that meets these requirements. If by trick or clever guess we can discover such a function, it’s got to be the answer. Trick: Forget about the actual problem; we’re going to study a completely different situation. This new configuration consists of two point charges, +q at (0, 0, d) and −q at (0, 0, −d),and no conducting plane (Fig. 3.11). For this configuration, I can easily write down the potential: V (x, y, z) = 1 4πϵ0 [ q √ x2 + y2 + (z − d)2 − q √ x2 + y2 + (z + d)2 ]. (3.9) (The denominators represent the distances from (x, y, z) to the charges +q and −q, respectively.) It follows that (1) V = 0 when z = 0, (2) V → 0for x 2 + y 2 + z2 ≫ d2, and the only charge in the region z > 0 is the point charge +q at (0, 0, d). But these are precisely the conditions of the original problem! Evidently, y q d x z V = 0 Fig. 3.10 y \u0004q d d x z \u0002q Fig. 3.11 125 3.2 The Method of Images the second configuration happens to produce exactly the same potential as the first configuration, in the “upper” region z ≥ 0. (The “lower” region, z < 0, is completely different, but who cares? The upper part is all we need.) Conclusion: The potential of a point charge above an infinite grounded conductor is given by Eq. 3.9,for z ≥ 0. Notice the crucial role played by the uniqueness theorem in this argu- ment: without it, no one would believe this solution, since it was obtained for a completely different charge distribution. But the uniqueness theorem certifies it: if it satisfies Poisson’s equation in the region of interest, and assumes the correct value at the boundaries, then it must be right. 3.2.2 Induced Surface Charge Now that we know the potential, it is a straightforward matter to compute the surface charge σ induced on the conductor. According to Eq. 2.49, σ = −ϵ0 ∂V ∂n , where ∂V /∂n is the normal derivative of V at the surface. In this case the normal direction is the z direction, so σ = −ϵ0 ∂V ∂z |||z=0. From Eq. 3.9, ∂V ∂z = 1 4πϵ0 { −q(z − d) [x2 + y2 + (z − d)2]3/2 + q(z + d) [x2 + y2 + (z + d)2]3/2 }, so 6 σ(x, y) = −qd 2π(x2 + y2 + d2)3/2 . (3.10) As expected, the induced charge is negative (assuming q is positive) and greatest at x = y = 0. While we’re at it, let’s compute the total induced charge Q = ∫ σ da. This integral, over the xy plane, could be done in Cartesian coordinates, with da = dx dy, but it’s a little easier to use polar coordinates (r, φ), with r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and da = rdrdφ. Then σ(r) = −qd 2π(r2 + d2)3/2 , and Q = ∫ 2π 0 ∫ ∞ 0 −qd 2π(r2 + d2)3/2 rdrdφ = qd √r2 + d2 ||| ∞ 0 = −q. (3.11) 6 For an entirely different derivation of this result, see Prob. 3.40. 126 3 Potentials The total charge induced on the plane is −q, as (with benefit of hindsight) you can perhaps convince yourself it had to be. 3.2.3 Force and Energy The charge q is attracted toward the plane, because of the negative induced charge. Let’s calculate the force of attraction. Since the potential in the vicinity of q is the same as in the analog problem (the one with +q and −q but no conductor), so also is the field and, therefore, the force: F = − 1 4πϵ0 q 2 (2d)2 ˆz. (3.12) Beware: It is easy to get carried away, and assume that everything is the same in the two problems. Energy, however, is not the same. With the two point charges and no conductor, Eq. 2.42 gives W = − 1 4πϵ0 q 2 2d . (3.13) But for a single charge and conducting plane, the energy is half of this: W = − 1 4πϵ0 q 2 4d . (3.14) Why half ? Think of the energy as stored in the fields (Eq. 2.45): W = ϵ0 2 ∫ E2 dτ. In the two-charge analog (Fig. 3.11), both the upper region (z > 0) and the lower region (z < 0) contribute – and by symmetry they contribute equally. But in the original configuration (Fig. 3.10), only the upper region contains a nonzero field, and hence the energy is half as great. 7 Of course, one could also determine the energy by calculating the work it takes to bring q in from infinity. The force required (to oppose the electrical force in Eq. 3.12)is (1/4πϵ0)(q 2/4z2)ˆz,so W = ∫ d ∞ F · dl = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ d ∞ q 2 4z2 dz = 1 4πϵ0 (− q 2 4z )||| d ∞ = − 1 4πϵ0 q 2 4d . AsImove q toward the conductor, I do work only on q. It is true that induced charge is moving in over the conductor, but this costs me nothing, since the whole conductor is at potential zero. By contrast, if I simultaneously bring in two point charges (with no conductor), I do work on both of them, and the total is (again) twice as great. 7 For a generalization of this result, see M. M. Taddei, T. N. C. Mendes, and C. Farina, Eur. J. Phys. 30, 965 (2009), and Prob. 3.45b. 127 3.2 The Method of Images 3.2.4 Other Image Problems The method just described is not limited to a single point charge; any stationary charge distribution near a grounded conducting plane can be treated in the same way, by introducing its mirror image – hence the name method of images. (Remember that the image charges have the opposite sign; this is what guarantees that the xy plane will be at potential zero.) There are also some exotic problems that can be handled in similar fashion; the nicest of these is the following. Example 3.2. A point charge q is situated a distance a from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R < a (Fig. 3.12). Find the potential outside the sphere. q a R V = 0 Fig. 3.12 a qq'b r θ ' Fig. 3.13 Solution. Examine the completely different configuration, consisting of the point charge q together with another point charge q′ = − R a q, (3.15) placed a distance b = R2 a (3.16) to the right of the center of the sphere (Fig. 3.13). No conductor now – just the two point charges. The potential of this configuration is V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ( q + q′ ′ ), (3.17) where and ′ are the distances from q and q′, respectively. Now, it happens (see Prob. 3.8) that this potential vanishes at all points on the sphere (r = R), and therefore fits the boundary conditions for our original problem, in the exterior region.8 Conclusion: Equation 3.17 is the potential of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere. 8 This solution is due to William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), who published it in 1848, when he was just 24. It was apparently inspired by a theorem of Apollonius (200 BC) that says the locus of points with a fixed ratio of distances from two given points is a sphere. See J. C. Maxwell, Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, Vol. I, Dover, New York (1954), p. 245. I thank Gabriel Karl for this interesting history. 128 3 Potentials (Notice that b is less than R, so the “image” charge q′ is safely inside the sphere – you cannot put image charges in the region where you are calculating V ; that would change ρ, and you’d be solving Poisson’s equation with the wrong source.) In particular, the force of attraction between the charge and the sphere is F = 1 4πϵ0 qq′ (a − b)2 = − 1 4πϵ0 q 2Ra (a2 − R2)2 . (3.18) The method of images is delightfully simple … when it works. But it is as much an art as a science, for you must somehow think up just the right “auxiliary” configuration, and for most shapes this is forbiddingly complicated, if not impossible. Problem 3.7. Find the force on the charge +q in Fig. 3.14.(The xy plane is a grounded conductor.) V = 0 y +q d 3d x z −2q Fig. 3.14 Problem 3.8. (a) Using the law of cosines, show that Eq. 3.17 can be written as V (r, θ) = 1 4πϵ0 [ q √r2 + a2 − 2ra cos θ − q √ R2 + (ra/R)2 − 2ra cos θ ], (3.19) where r and θ are the usual spherical polar coordinates, with the z-axis along the line through q. In this form, it is obvious that V = 0 on the sphere, r = R. (b) Find the induced surface charge on the sphere, as a function of θ. Integrate this to get the total induced charge. (What should it be?) (c) Calculate the energy of this configuration. Problem 3.9. Find the force on a point charge q, a distance a from the center of a grounded spherical conducting shell of inner radius R,if a < R. Problem 3.10. In Ex. 3.2 we assumed that the conducting sphere was grounded (V = 0). But with the addition of a second image charge, the same basic model will handle the case of a sphere at any potential V0 (relative, of course, to infinity). What charge should you use, and where should you put it? Find the force of attraction between a point charge q and a neutral conducting sphere. 129 3.3 Separation of Variables Problem 3.11. Find the force between a point charge q and a nearby spherical conductor which also carries (total) charge q (use the method of Prob. 3.10). Show that this force is actually attractive (!) if the separation distance a is less than a critical value ac.What is that critical value? [Answer: R(1 + √ 5)/2.] ! Problem 3.12. A uniform line charge λ is placed on an infinite straight wire, a distance d above a grounded conducting plane. (Let’s say the wire runs parallel to the x-axis and directly above it, and the conducting plane is the xy plane.) (a) Find the potential in the region above the plane. [Hint: Refer to Prob. 2.53.] (b) Find the charge density σ induced on the conducting plane. Problem 3.13. Two semi-infinite grounded conducting planes meet at right angles. In the region between them, there is a point charge q, situated as shown in Fig. 3.15. Set up the image configuration, and calculate the potential in this region. What charges do you need, and where should they be located? What is the force on q? How much work did it take to bring q in from infinity? Suppose the planes met at some angle other than 90◦; would you still be able to solve the problem by the method of images? If not, for what particular angles does the method work? xa y b q V = 0 Fig. 3.15 y R \u0002d \u0004d x \u0002V0 R \u0004V0 Fig. 3.16 ! Problem 3.14. Two long, straight copper pipes, each of radius R, are held a distance 2d apart. One is at potential V0, the other at −V0 (Fig. 3.16). Find the potential everywhere. [Hint: Exploit the result of Prob. 2.53.] 3.3 Separation of Variables In this section we attack Laplace’s equation directly, using the method of separation of variables, which is the physicist’s favorite tool for solving par- tial differential equations. The method is applicable in circumstances where the potential (V ) or the charge density (σ) is specified on the boundaries of some region, and we are asked to find the potential in the interior. The basic strategy is very simple: we look for solutions that are products of functions, each of which depends on only one of the coordinates. The algebraic details, however, can be formidable, so I’m going to develop the method through a sequence of examples. We’ll start with Cartesian coordinates and then do spherical coordinates (I’ll leave the cylindrical case for you to tackle on your own, in Prob. 3.26). 130 3 Potentials 3.3.1 Cartesian Coordinates Example 3.3. Two infinite grounded metal plates lie parallel to the xz plane, one at y = 0, the other at y = a (Fig. 3.17). The left end, at x = 0, is closed off with an infinite strip insulated from the two plates, and maintained at a specified potential V0(y). Find the potential inside this “slot.” Solution. The configuration is independent of z, so this is really a two- dimensional problem. In mathematical terms, we must solve Laplace’s equation, ∂2V ∂x2 + ∂2V ∂y2 = 0, (3.20) subject to the boundary conditions (i) V = 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = V0(y) when x = 0, (iv) V → 0as x →∞. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (3.21) (The latter, although not explicitly stated in the problem, is necessary on physical grounds: as you get farther and farther away from the “hot” strip at x = 0, the potential should drop to zero.) Since the potential is specified on all boundaries, the answer is uniquely determined. The first step is to look for solutions in the form of products: V (x, y) = X (x)Y (y). (3.22) On the face of it, this is an absurd restriction – the overwhelming majority of solutions to Laplace’s equation do not have such a form. For example, V (x, y) = (5x + 6y) satisfies Eq. 3.20,but youcan’t express it as the product of a function of x times a function of y. Obviously, we’re only going to get a tiny subset of all possible solutions by this means, and it would be a miracle if one of them happened to fit the boundary conditions of our problem. But hang on, because the solutions we do get are very special, and it turns out that by pasting them together we can construct the general solution. x z V = 0 V0(y) y a V = 0 Fig. 3.17 131 3.3 Separation of Variables Anyway, putting Eq. 3.22 into Eq. 3.20, we obtain Y d2X dx2 + X d2Y dy2 = 0. The next step is to “separate the variables” (that is, collect all the x- dependence into one term and all the y-dependence into another). Typically, this is accomplished by dividing through by V : 1 X d2X dx2 + 1 Y d2Y dy2 = 0. (3.23) Here the first term depends only on x and the second only on y;in other words, we have an equation of the form f (x) + g(y) = 0. (3.24) Now, there’s only one way this could possibly be true: f and g must both be constant. For if f (x) changed,asyouvary x, then by holding y fixed and fiddling with x, the sum f (x)+g(y) would change, in violation of Eq. 3.24, which says it’s always zero. (That’s a simple but somehow rather elusive argument; don’t accept it without due thought, because the whole method rides on it.) It follows from Eq. 3.23, then, that 1 X d2X dx2 = C1 and 1 Y d2Y dy2 = C2, with C1 + C2 = 0. (3.25) One of these constants is positive, the other negative (or perhaps both are zero). In general, one must investigate all the possibilities; however, in this particular problem we need C1 positive (call it k2)and C2 negative, for reasons that will appear in a moment. Thus d2X dx2 = k2X , d2Y dy2 = −k2Y . (3.26) Notice what has happened: a partial differential equation (3.20) has been converted into two ordinary differential equations (3.26). The advantage of this is obvious – ordinary differential equations are a lot easier to solve. Indeed, X (x) = Aekx + Be−kx, Y (y) = C sin ky + D cos ky, so V (x, y) = (Aekx + Be−kx)(C sin ky + D cos ky). (3.27) This is the appropriate separable solution to Laplace’s equation; it remains to impose the boundary conditions, and see what they tell us about the constants. To begin at the end, condition (iv) requires that A equal zero.9 Absorbing B into C and D,weareleft with 9 I’m assuming k is positive, but this involves no loss of generality – negative k gives the same solution (Eq. 3.27), only with the constants shuffled (A ↔ B, C →−C). Occasionally (though not in this example), k = 0 must also be included (see Prob. 3.59). 132 3 Potentials V (x, y) = e−kx(C sin ky + D cos ky). Condition (i) now demands that D equal zero, so V (x, y) = Ce−kx sin ky. (3.28) Meanwhile, (ii) yields sin ka = 0, from which it follows that k = nπ a (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). (3.29) (At this point you can see why I chose C1 positive and C2 negative: if X were sinusoidal, we could never arrange for it to go to zero at infinity, and if Y were exponential we could not make it vanish at both 0 and a. Incidentally, n = 0 is no good, for in that case the potential vanishes everywhere. And we have already excluded negative ns.) That’s as far as we can go, using separable solutions, and unless V0(y) just happens to have the form sin(nπy/a) for some integer n,we simply can’t fit the final boundary condition at x = 0. But now comes the critical step that redeems the method: separation of variables has yielded an infinite family of solutions (one for each n), and whereas none of them by itself satisfies the final boundary condition, it is possible to combine them in a way that does. Laplace’s equation is linear, in the sense that if V1, V2, V3, ... satisfy it, so does any linear combination, V = α1V1 + α2V2 + α3V3 + ··· ,where α1, α2, ... are arbitrary constants. For ∇ 2V = α1∇ 2V1 + α2∇ 2V2 + ··· = 0α1 + 0α2 + ··· = 0. Exploiting this fact, we can patch together the separable solutions (Eq. 3.28) to construct a much more general solution: V (x, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cne−nπx/a sin(nπy/a). (3.30) This still satisfies three of the boundary conditions; but can we (by ast- ute choice of the coefficients Cn) fit the final boundary condition (iii), V (0, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cn sin(nπy/a) = V0(y)? (3.31) Well, you may recognize this sum – it’s a Fourier sine series.And Dirichlet’s theorem 10 guarantees that virtually any function V0(y) –it can even have a finite number of discontinuities – can be expanded in such a series. But how do we actually determine the coefficients Cn, buried as they are in that infinite sum? The device for accomplishing this is so lovely it deserves a name – I call it Fourier’s trick, though it seems Euler had 10 M. Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 3rd ed., John Wiley, New York (2006), p. 356. 133 3.3 Separation of Variables used essentially the same idea somewhat earlier. Here’s how it goes: multiply Eq. 3.31 by sin(n′πy/a) (where n′ is a positive integer), and integrate from 0 to a: ∞∑ n=1 Cn ∫ a 0 sin(nπy/a) sin(n′πy/a) dy = ∫ a 0 V0(y) sin(n′πy/a) dy. (3.32) You can work out the integral on the left for yourself; the answer is ∫ a 0 sin(nπy/a) sin(n′πy/a) dy = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0if n′ \u0002 n, a/2 if n′ = n. (3.33) Thus all the terms in the series drop out, save only the one where n = n′, and the left-hand side of Eq. 3.32, reduces to (a/2)Cn′. Conclusion:11 Cn = 2 a ∫ a 0 V0(y) sin(nπy/a) dy. (3.34) That does it: Eq. 3.30 is the solution, with coefficients given by Eq. 3.34. As a concrete example, suppose the strip at x = 0 is a metal plate with constant potential V0 (remember, it’s insulated from the grounded plates at y = 0and y = a). Then Cn = 2V0 a ∫ a 0 sin(nπy/a) dy = 2V0 nπ (1 − cos nπ) = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0if n is even, 4V0/nπ if n is odd. (3.35) Thus V (x, y) = 4V0 π ∑ n=1,3,5,... 1 n e−nπx/a sin(nπy/a). (3.36) Figure 3.18 is a plot of this potential; Fig. 3.19 shows how the first few terms in the Fourier series combine to make a better and better approx- imation to the constant V0:(a) is n = 1 only, (b) includes n up to 5, (c) is the sum of the first 10 terms, and (d) is the sum of the first 100 terms. 1.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.5V/V0 x/a y/a Fig. 3.18 11 For aesthetic reasons I’ve dropped the prime; Eq. 3.34 holds for n = 1, 2, 3, ... ,and it doesn’t matter (obviously) what letter you use for the “dummy” index. 134 3 Potentials y/a 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.2 (d)(c) (b) (a) 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 V/V0 Fig. 3.19 Incidentally, the infinite series in Eq. 3.36 can be summed explicitly (try your hand at it, if you like); the result is 12 V (x, y) = 2V0 π tan−1 ( sin(πy/a) sinh(πx/a) ). (3.37) In this form, it is easy to check that Laplace’s equation is obeyed and the four boundary conditions (Eq. 3.21) are satisfied. The success of this method hinged on two extraordinary properties of the separable solutions (Eqs. 3.28 and 3.29): completeness and orthogonal- ity. A set of functions fn(y) is said to be complete if any other function f (y) can be expressed as a linear combination of them: f (y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cnfn(y). (3.38) The functions sin(nπy/a) are complete on the interval 0 ≤ y ≤ a.Itwas this fact, guaranteed by Dirichlet’s theorem, that assured us Eq. 3.31 could be satisfied, given the proper choice of the coefficients Cn.(The proof of completeness, for a particular set of functions, is an extremely difficult business, and I’m afraid physicists tend to assume it’s true and leave the checking to others.) A set of functions is orthogonal if the integral of the product of any two distinct members of the set is zero: ∫ a 0 fn(y)fn′ (y) dy = 0for n′ \u0002 n. (3.39) 12 Are you perhaps disappointed that separation of variables delivers a “solution” (Eq. 3.36)in the form of an infinite series? Why not a tidy “closed form,” like Eq. 3.37? (It is rare, actually, that the series can be summed explicitly.) In truth, there is less to this distinction than meets the eye. Mathematicians like to tell us that sin x (for instance) is “really” shorthand for the series x − (1/3! )x 3 + (1/5! )x 5 −· · · . A (convergent) series is a perfectly good way to define a function, and the only question is whether or not that series has a familiar name. The ones that occur frequently have been given names (trigonometric functions, Bessel functions, hypergeometric functions, and so on), but that’s nothing deep – just a matter of convenience. 135 3.3 Separation of Variables The sine functions are orthogonal (Eq. 3.33); this is the property on which Fourier’s trick is based, allowing us to kill off all terms but one in the infinite series and thereby solve for the coefficients Cn. (Proof of orthogonality is generally quite simple, either by direct integration or by analysis of the differential equation from which the functions came.) Example 3.4. Two infinitely long grounded metal plates, again at y = 0 and y = a, are connected at x = ±b by metal strips maintained at a constant potential V0, as shown in Fig. 3.20 (a thin layer of insulation at each corner prevents them from shorting out). Find the potential inside the resulting rectangular pipe. Solution. Once again, the configuration is independent of z.Our problem is to solve Laplace’s equation ∂2V ∂x2 + ∂2V ∂y2 = 0, subject to the boundary conditions (i) V = 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = V0 when x = b, (iv) V = V0 when x = −b. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (3.40) The argument runs as before, up to Eq. 3.27: V (x, y) = (Aekx + Be−kx)(C sin ky + D cos ky). This time, however, we cannot set A = 0; the region in question does not extend to x = ∞,so e kx is perfectly acceptable. On the other hand, the situation is symmetric with respect to x,so V (−x, y) = V (x, y),and it follows that A = B. Using ekx + e−kx = 2 cosh kx, and absorbing 2A into C and D,wehave V (x, y) = cosh kx(C sin ky + D cos ky). x y a V0 V0 z V=0 V=0 \u0002b b Fig. 3.20 136 3 Potentials Boundary conditions (i) and (ii) require, as before, that D = 0and k = nπ/a,so V (x, y) = C cosh(nπx/a) sin(nπy/a). (3.41) Because V (x, y) is even in x, it will automatically meet condition (iv) if it fits (iii). It remains, therefore, to construct the general linear combination, V (x, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cn cosh(nπx/a) sin(nπy/a), and pick the coefficients Cn in such a way as to satisfy condition (iii): V (b, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Cn cosh(nπb/a) sin(nπy/a) = V0. This is the same problem in Fourier analysis that we faced before; I quote the result from Eq. 3.35: Cn cosh(nπb/a) = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0if n is even, 4V0/nπ if n is odd. Conclusion: The potential in this case is given by V (x, y) = 4V0 π ∑ n=1,3,5,... 1 n cosh(nπx/a) cosh(nπb/a) sin(nπy/a). (3.42) This function is shown in Fig. 3.21. y/a x/a V/V0 0.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 1.0 Fig. 3.21 Example 3.5. An infinitely long rectangular metal pipe (sides a and b) is grounded, but one end, at x = 0, is maintained at a specified potential V0(y, z), as indicated in Fig. 3.22. Find the potential inside the pipe. Solution. This is a fully three-dimensional problem, ∂2V ∂x2 + ∂2V ∂y2 + ∂2V ∂z2 = 0, (3.43) 137 3.3 Separation of Variables x y z V = 0 V0(y, z) V = 0 a b Fig. 3.22 subject to the boundary conditions (i) V = 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = 0 when z = 0, (iv) V = 0 when z = b, (v) V → 0as x →∞, (vi) V = V0(y, z) when x = 0. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (3.44) As always, we look for solutions that are products: V (x, y, z) = X (x)Y (y)Z(z). (3.45) Putting this into Eq. 3.43, and dividing by V , we find 1 X d2X dx2 + 1 Y d2Y dy2 + 1 Z d2Z dz2 = 0. It follows that 1 X d2X dx2 = C1, 1 Y d2Y dy2 = C2, 1 Z d2Z dz2 = C3, with C1 + C2 + C3 = 0. Our previous experience (Ex. 3.3) suggests that C1 must be positive, C2 and C3 negative. Setting C2 = −k2 and C3 = −l2,wehave C1 = k2 + l2, and hence d2X dx2 = (k2 + l2)X , d2Y dy2 = −k2Y , d2Z dz2 = −l2Z. (3.46) Once again, separation of variables has turned a partial differential equation into ordinary differential equations. The solutions are X (x) = Ae √k2+l2x + Be−√k2+l2x, Y (y) = C sin ky + D cos ky, Z(z) = E sin lz + F cos lz. Boundary condition (v) implies A = 0, (i) gives D = 0, and (iii) yields F = 0, whereas (ii) and (iv) require that k = nπ/a and l = mπ/b,where n and m are positive integers. Combining the remaining constants, we are left with 138 3 Potentials V (x, y, z) = Ce−π√(n/a)2+(m/b)2x sin(nπy/a) sin(mπz/b). (3.47) This solution meets all the boundary conditions except (vi). It contains two unspecified integers (n and m), and the most general linear combi- nation is a double sum: V (x, y, z) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 Cn,me−π√(n/a)2+(m/b)2x sin(nπy/a) sin(mπz/b). (3.48) We hope to fit the remaining boundary condition, V (0, y, z) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 Cn,m sin(nπy/a) sin(mπz/b) = V0(y, z), (3.49) by appropriate choice of the coefficients Cn,m. To determine these constants, we multiply by sin(n′πy/a) sin(m′πz/b),where n′ and m′ are arbitrary positive integers, and integrate: ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 Cn,m ∫ a 0 sin(nπy/a) sin(n′πy/a) dy ∫ b 0 sin(mπz/b) sin(m′πz/b) dz = ∫ a 0 ∫ b 0 V0(y, z) sin(n′πy/a) sin(m′πz/b) dy dz. Quoting Eq. 3.33, the left-hand side is (ab/4)Cn′,m′,so Cn,m = 4 ab ∫ a 0 ∫ b 0 V0(y, z) sin(nπy/a) sin(mπz/b) dy dz. (3.50) Equation 3.48, with the coefficients given by Eq. 3.50, is the solution to our problem. For instance, if the end of the tube is a conductor at constant potential V0, Cn,m = 4V0 ab ∫ a 0 sin(nπy/a) dy ∫ b 0 sin(mπz/b) dz = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0if n or m is even, 16V0/π2nm if n and m are odd. (3.51) In this case, V (x, y, z) = 16V0 π2 ∞∑ n,m=1,3,5,... 1 nm e−π√(n/a)2+(m/b)2x × sin(nπy/a) sin(mπz/b). (3.52) Notice that the successive terms decrease rapidly; a reasonable approx- imation would be obtained by keeping only the first few. Problem 3.15. Find the potential in the infinite slot of Ex. 3.3 if the boundary at x = 0 consists of two metal strips: one, from y = 0 to y = a/2, is held at a constant potential V0,and the other, from y = a/2 to y = a, is at potential −V0. 139 3.3 Separation of Variables Problem 3.16. For the infinite slot (Ex. 3.3), determine the charge density σ(y) on the strip at x = 0, assuming it is a conductor at constant potential V0. Problem 3.17. A rectangular pipe, running parallel to the z-axis (from −∞ to +∞), has three grounded metal sides, at y = 0, y = a,and x = 0. The fourth side, at x = b, is maintained at a specified potential V0(y). (a) Develop a general formula for the potential inside the pipe. (b) Find the potential explicitly, for the case V0(y) = V0 (a constant). Problem 3.18. A cubical box (side length a) consists of five metal plates, which are welded together and grounded (Fig. 3.23). The top is made of a separate sheet of metal, insulated from the others, and held at a constant potential V0. Find the potential inside the box. [What should the potential at the center (a/2, a/2, a/2) be? Check numerically that your formula is consistent with this value.]13 y z x V0 a a a Fig. 3.23 3.3.2 Spherical Coordinates In the examples considered so far, Cartesian coordinates were clearly appropriate, since the boundaries were planes. For round objects, spherical coordinates are more natural. In the spherical system, Laplace’s equation reads 1 r2 ∂ ∂r (r 2 ∂V ∂r ) + 1 r2 sin θ ∂ ∂θ (sin θ ∂V ∂θ ) + 1 r2 sin2 θ ∂2V ∂φ2 = 0. (3.53) I shall assume the problem has azimuthal symmetry, so that V is independent of φ; 14 in that case, Eq. 3.53 reduces to ∂ ∂r (r 2 ∂V ∂r ) + 1 sin θ ∂ ∂θ (sin θ ∂V ∂θ ) = 0. (3.54) 13 This cute test was suggested by J. Castro. 14 The general case, for φ-dependent potentials, is treated in all the graduate texts. See, for instance, J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., John Wiley, New York (1999), Chap. 3. 140 3 Potentials As before, we look for solutions that are products: V (r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ). (3.55) Putting this into Eq. 3.54, and dividing by V , 1 R d dr (r 2 dR dr ) + 1 Θ sin θ d dθ (sin θ dΘ dθ ) = 0. (3.56) Since the first term depends only on r, and the second only on θ, it follows that each must be a constant: 1 R d dr (r 2 dR dr ) = l(l + 1), 1 Θ sin θ d dθ (sin θ dΘ dθ ) = −l(l + 1). (3.57) Here l(l + 1) is just a fancy way of writing the separation constant – you’ll see in a minute why this is convenient. As always, separation of variables has converted a partial differential equation (3.54) into ordinary differential equations (3.57). The radial equa- tion, d dr (r 2 dR dr ) = l(l + 1)R, (3.58) has the general solution R(r) = Arl + B rl+1 , (3.59) as you can easily check; A and B are the two arbitrary constants to be expected in the solution of a second-order differential equation. But the angular equation, d dθ (sin θ dΘ dθ ) = −l(l + 1) sin θ Θ, (3.60) is not so simple. The solutions are Legendre polynomials in the variable cos θ: Θ(θ) = Pl (cos θ). (3.61) The function Pl (x) is most conveniently defined by the Rodrigues formula: Pl (x) ≡ 1 2ll! ( d dx ) l (x2 − 1)l. (3.62) The first few Legendre polynomials are listed in Table 3.1. Notice that Pl (x) is (as the name suggests) an lth-order polynomial in x; it contains only even Table 3.1. Legendre polynomials. P0(x) = 1 P1(x) = x P2(x) = (3x2 − 1)/2 P3(x) = (5x3 − 3x)/2 P4(x) = (35x4 − 30x2 + 3)/8 P5(x) = (63x5 − 70x3 + 15x)/8 141 3.3 Separation of Variables powers if l is even, and odd powers if l is odd. The factor in front, (1/2 ll! ), was chosen (historically) in order that Pl (1) = 1. (3.63) The Rodrigues formula obviously works only for nonnegative integer values of l. Moreover, it provides us with only one solution. But Eq. 3.60 is second order, and it should possess two independent solutions, for every value of l. It turns out that these “other solutions” blow up at θ = 0 and/or θ = π, and are therefore unacceptable on physical grounds. 15 For instance, the second solution for l = 0is Θ(θ) = ln(tan θ 2 ). (3.64) You might want to check for yourself that this satisfies Eq. 3.60. In the case of azimuthal symmetry, then, the most general separable solution to Laplace’s equation, consistent with minimal physical require- ments, is V (r, θ) = (Arl + B rl+1 )Pl (cos θ). (There was no need to include an overall constant in Eq. 3.61 because it can be absorbed into A and B at this stage.) As before, separation of variables yields an infinite set of solutions, one for each l.The general solution is a linear combination of separable solutions: V (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 (Alr l + Bl rl+1 )Pl (cos θ). (3.65) The following examples illustrate the power of this important result. Example 3.6. The potential V0(θ) is specified on the surface of a hollow sphere, of radius R. Find the potential inside the sphere. Solution. In this case, Bl = 0 for all l – otherwise the potential would blow up at the origin. Thus, V (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Alr lPl (cos θ). (3.66) At r = R this must match the specified function V0(θ): V (R, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 AlRlPl (cos θ) = V0(θ). (3.67) Can this equation be satisfied, for an appropriate choice of coefficients Al? Yes: the Legendre polynomials (like the sines) constitute a 15 In rare cases where the z-axis is excluded, these “other solutions” do have to be considered. 142 3 Potentials complete set of functions, on the interval −1 ≤ x ≤ 1(0 ≤ θ ≤ π). How do we determine the constants? Again, by Fourier’s trick, the Legendre polynomials (like the sines) are orthogonal functions: 16 ∫ 1 −1 Pl (x)Pl′ (x) dx = ∫ π 0 Pl (cos θ)Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ dθ = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0if l′ \u0002 l, 2/(2l + 1) if l′ = l. (3.68) Thus, multiplying Eq. 3.67 by Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ and integrating, we have Al′Rl′ 2 2l′ + 1 = ∫ π 0 V0(θ)Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ dθ, or Al = 2l + 1 2Rl ∫ π 0 V0(θ)Pl (cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.69) Equation 3.66 is the solution to our problem, with the coefficients given by Eq. 3.69. It can be difficult to evaluate integrals of the form 3.69 analytically, and in practice it is often easier to solve Eq. 3.67 “by eyeball.” 17 For instance, suppose we are told that the potential on the sphere is V0(θ) = k sin2(θ/2), (3.70) where k is a constant. Using the half-angle formula, we rewrite this as V0(θ) = k 2 (1 − cos θ) = k 2 [P0(cos θ) − P1(cos θ)]. Putting this into Eq. 3.67, we read off immediately that A0 = k/2, A1 = −k/(2R),and allother Al’s vanish. Therefore, V (r, θ) = k 2 [r 0P0(cos θ) − r 1 R P1(cos θ)] = k 2 (1 − r R cos θ). (3.71) Example 3.7. The potential V0(θ) is again specified on the surface of a sphere of radius R, but this time we are asked to find the potential outside, assuming there is no charge there. Solution. In this case it’s the Als that must be zero (else V would not go to zero at ∞), so V (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl rl+1 Pl (cos θ). (3.72) 16 M. Boas, footnote 9, Sect. 12.7. 17 This is certainly true whenever V0 (θ) can be expressed as a polynomial in cos θ.The degree of the polynomial tells us the highest l we require, and the leading coefficient determines the corresponding Al. Subtracting off AlRlPl (cos θ) and repeating the process, we systematically work our way down to A0. Notice that if V0 is an even function of cos θ, then only even terms will occur in the sum (and likewise for odd functions). 143 3.3 Separation of Variables At the surface of the sphere, we require that V (R, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl Rl+1 Pl (cos θ) = V0(θ). Multiplying by Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ and integrating – exploiting, again, the orthogonality relation 3.68 –wehave Bl′ Rl′+1 2 2l′ + 1 = ∫ π 0 V0(θ)Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ dθ, or Bl = 2l + 1 2 Rl+1 ∫ π 0 V0(θ)Pl (cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.73) Equation 3.72, with the coefficients given by Eq. 3.73, is the solution to our problem. Example 3.8. An uncharged metal sphere of radius R is placed in an otherwise uniform electric field E = E0ˆz. The field will push positive charge to the “northern” surface of the sphere, and – symmetrically – negative charge to the “southern” surface (Fig. 3.24). This induced charge, in turn, distorts the field in the neighborhood of the sphere. Find the potential in the region outside the sphere. \u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 y z x R Fig. 3.24 Solution. The sphere is an equipotential – we might as well set V (R, θ) = 0. Then by symmetry the entire xy plane is at potential zero. This time, however, V does not go to zero at large z. In fact, far from the sphere the field is E0ˆz, and hence V →−E0z + C. Since V = 0 in the equatorial plane, the constant C must be zero. Accordingly, the boundary conditions for this problem are 144 3 Potentials (i) V = 0 when r = R, (ii) V →−E0r cos θ for r ≫ R. ⎫⎪⎬ ⎪ ⎭ (3.74) We must fit these boundary conditions with a function of the form 3.65. The first condition yields AlRl + Bl Rl+1 = 0, or Bl = −AlR2l+1, (3.75) so V (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Al (r l − R2l+1 rl+1 )Pl (cos θ). For r ≫ R, the second term in parentheses is negligible, and therefore condition (ii) requires that ∞∑ l=0 Alr lPl (cos θ) = −E0r cos θ. Evidently, only one term is present: l = 1. In fact, since P1(cos θ) = cos θ, we can read off immediately A1 = −E0, all other Alszero; B1 = E0R3, all other Blszero. Conclusion: V (r, θ) = −E0 (r − R3 r2 ) cos θ. (3.76) The first term (−E0r cos θ) is due to the external field; the contribu- tion attributable to the induced charge is E0 R3 r2 cos θ. If you want to know the induced charge density, it can be calculated in the usual way: σ(θ) = −ϵ0 ∂V ∂r |||r=R = ϵ0E0 (1 + 2 R3 r3 ) cos θ|||r=R = 3ϵ0E0 cos θ. (3.77) As expected, it is positive in the “northern” hemisphere (0 ≤ θ < π/2) and negative in the “southern” (π/2 < θ ≤ π). Example 3.9. A specified charge density σ0(θ) is glued over the surface of an empty spherical shell of radius R. Find the resulting potential inside and outside the sphere. Solution. You could, of course, do this by direct integration: V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ σ0 da, 145 3.3 Separation of Variables but separation of variables is often easier. For the interior region, we have V (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Alr lPl (cos θ)(r ≤ R) (3.78) (no Bl terms – they blow up at the center); in the exterior region, V (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl rl+1 Pl (cos θ)(r ≥ R) (3.79) (no Al terms – they don’t go to zero at infinity). These two functions must be joined together by the appropriate boundary conditions at the surface itself. First, the potential is continuous at r = R (Eq. 2.34): ∞∑ l=0 AlRlPl (cos θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Bl Rl+1 Pl (cos θ). (3.80) It follows that the coefficients of like Legendre polynomials are equal: Bl = AlR2l+1. (3.81) (To prove that formally, multiply both sides of Eq. 3.80 by Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ and integrate from 0 to π, using the orthogonality relation 3.68.) Second, the radial derivative of V suffers a discontinuity at the surface (Eq. 2.36): ( ∂Vout ∂r − ∂Vin ∂r )|||r=R = − 1 ϵ0 σ0(θ). (3.82) Thus − ∞∑ l=0 (l + 1) Bl Rl+2 Pl (cos θ) − ∞∑ l=0 lAlRl−1Pl (cos θ) = − 1 ϵ0 σ0(θ), or, using Eq. 3.81, ∞∑ l=0 (2l + 1)AlRl−1Pl (cos θ) = 1 ϵ0 σ0(θ). (3.83) From here, the coefficients can be determined using Fourier’s trick: Al = 1 2ϵ0Rl−1 ∫ π 0 σ0(θ)Pl (cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.84) Equations 3.78 and 3.79 constitute the solution to our problem, with the coefficients given by Eqs. 3.81 and 3.84. For instance, if σ0(θ) = k cos θ = kP1(cos θ), (3.85) for some constant k, then all the Al’s are zero except for l = 1, and A1 = k 2ϵ0 ∫ π 0 [P1(cos θ)]2 sin θ dθ = k 3ϵ0 . 146 3 Potentials The potential inside the sphere is therefore V (r, θ) = k 3ϵ0 r cos θ (r ≤ R), (3.86) whereas outside the sphere, V (r, θ) = kR3 3ϵ0 1 r2 cos θ (r ≥ R). (3.87) In particular, if σ0(θ) is the induced charge on a metal sphere in an external field E0ˆz, so that k = 3ϵ0E0 (Eq. 3.77), then the potential inside is E0r cos θ = E0z,andthefieldis −E0ˆz, which is exactly right to cancel off the external field, as of course it should be. Outside the sphere the potential due to this surface charge is E0 R3 r2 cos θ, consistent with our conclusion in Ex. 3.8. Problem 3.19. Derive P3(x) from the Rodrigues formula, and check that P3(cos θ) sat- isfies the angular equation (3.60) for l = 3.Check that P3 and P1 are orthogonal by explicit integration. Problem 3.20. (a) Suppose the potential is a constant V0 over the surface of the sphere. Use the results of Exs. 3.6 and 3.7 to find the potential inside and outside the sphere. (Of course, you know the answers in advance – this is just a consistency check on the method.) (b) Find the potential inside and outside a spherical shell that carries a uniform surface charge σ0, using the results of Ex. 3.9. Problem 3.21. The potential at the surface of a sphere (radius R) is given by V0 = k cos 3θ, where k is a constant. Find the potential inside and outside the sphere, as well as the surface charge density σ(θ) on the sphere. (Assume there’s no charge inside or outside the sphere.) Problem 3.22. Suppose the potential V0(θ) at the surface of a sphere is specified, and there is no charge inside or outside the sphere. Show that the charge density on the sphere is given by σ(θ) = ϵ0 2R ∞∑ l=0 (2l + 1)2ClPl (cos θ), (3.88) where Cl = ∫ π 0 V0(θ)Pl (cos θ) sin θ dθ. (3.89) Problem 3.23. Find the potential outside a charged metal sphere (charge Q,radius R) placed in an otherwise uniform electric field E0. Explain clearly where you are setting the zero of potential. 147 3.4 Multipole Expansion Problem 3.24. In Prob. 2.26, you found the potential on the axis of a uniformly charged disk: V (r,0) = σ 2ϵ0 (√ r2 + R2 − r). (a) Use this, together with the fact that Pl (1) = 1, to evaluate the first three terms in the expansion (Eq. 3.72) for the potential of the disk at points off the axis, assuming r > R. (b) Find the potential for r < R by the same method, using Eq. 3.66.[Note: You must break the interior region up into two hemispheres, above and below the disk. Do not assume the coefficients Al are the same in both hemispheres.] Problem 3.25. A spherical shell of radius R carries a uniform surface charge σ0 on the “north- ern” hemisphere and a uniform surface charge −σ0 on the “southern” hemisphere. Find the potential inside and outside the sphere, calculating the coefficients explicitly up to A6 and B6. • Problem 3.26. Solve Laplace’s equation by separation of variables in cylindrical coordinates, assuming there is no dependence on z (cylindrical symmetry). [Make sure you find all solutions to the radial equation; in particular, your result must accommodate the case of an infinite line charge, for which (of course) we already know the answer.] Problem 3.27. Find the potential outside an infinitely long metal pipe, of radius R, placed at right angles to an otherwise uniform electric field E0. Find the surface charge induced on the pipe. [Use your result from Prob. 3.26.] Problem 3.28. Charge density σ(φ) = a sin 5φ (where a is a constant) is glued over the surface of an infinite cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.25). Find the potential inside and outside the cylinder. [Use your result from Prob. 3.26.] x y z R φ Fig. 3.25 3.4 Multipole Expansion 3.4.1 Approximate Potentials at Large Distances If you are very far away from a localized charge distribution, it “looks” like a point charge, and the potential is, to good approximation, (1/4πϵ0)Q/r, 148 3 Potentials where Q is the total charge. We have often used this as a check on formulas for V . But what if Q is zero? You might reply that the potential is then approximately zero, and of course, you’re right, in a sense (indeed, the potential at large r is pretty small even if Q is not zero). But we’re looking for something a bit more informative than that. Example 3.10. A (physical) electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges (±q) separated by a distance d. Find the approximate potential at points far from the dipole. Solution. Let − be the distance from −q and + the distance from +q (Fig. 3.26). Then \u0002q d \u0004q θ r Fig. 3.26 V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ( q + − q − ), and (from the law of cosines) 2 ± = r 2 + (d/2)2 ∓ rd cos θ = r 2 (1 ∓ d r cos θ + d2 4r2 ). We’re interested in the distant zone, where r ≫ d,sothe thirdtermis negligible, and the binomial expansion yields 1 ± ≈ 1 r (1 ∓ d r cos θ) −1/2 ≈ 1 r (1 ± d 2r cos θ). Thus 1 + − 1 − ≈ d r2 cos θ, and hence V (r) ≈ 1 4πϵ0 qd cos θ r2 . (3.90) The potential of a dipole goes like 1/r 2 at large r; as we might have anticipated, it falls off more rapidly than the potential of a point charge. If we put together a pair of equal and opposite dipoles to make a quadrupole, the potential goes like 1/r 3; for back-to-back quadrupoles (an octopole), it goes like 1/r 4; and so on. Figure 3.27 summarizes 149 3.4 Multipole Expansion \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004\u0002 \u0002\u0004 \u0004\u0002 Quadrupole (V ~ 1/r3) Octopole (V ~ 1/r4) Monopole (V ~ 1/r) Dipole (V ~ 1/r2) Fig. 3.27 this hierarchy; for completeness I have included the electric monopole (point charge), whose potential, of course, goes like 1/r. Example 3.10 involves a specific charge configuration. I propose now to develop a systematic expansion for the potential of any localized charge distribution, in powers of 1/r. Figure 3.28 defines the relevant variables; the potential at r is given by V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ 1 ρ(r′) dτ′. (3.91) Using the law of cosines, 2 = r 2 + (r′)2 − 2rr′ cos α = r 2 [1 + ( r′ r ) 2 − 2( r′ r ) cos α], where α is the angle between r and r′. Thus = r √ 1 + ϵ, (3.92) with ϵ ≡ ( r′ r )( r′ r − 2 cos α). For points well outside the charge distribution, ϵ is much less than 1, and this invites a binomial expansion: 1 = 1 r (1 + ϵ)−1/2 = 1 r (1 − 1 2 ϵ + 3 8 ϵ2 − 5 16 ϵ3 + ··· ), (3.93) dτ α Fig. 3.28 150 3 Potentials or, in terms of r, r′,and α, 1 = 1 r [1 − 1 2 ( r′ r )( r′ r − 2 cos α) + 3 8 ( r′ r ) 2 ( r′ r − 2 cos α) 2 − 5 16 ( r′ r ) 3 ( r′ r − 2 cos α) 3 + ··· ] = 1 r [1 + ( r′ r ) (cos α) + ( r′ r ) 2 ( 3 cos2 α − 1 2 ) + ( r′ r ) 3 ( 5 cos3 α − 3 cos α 2 ) + ··· ]. In the last step, I have collected together like powers of (r′/r); surprisingly, their coefficients (the terms in parentheses) are Legendre polynomials! The remarkable result18 is that 1 = 1 r ∞∑ n=0 ( r′ r ) nPn(cos α). (3.94) Substituting this back into Eq. 3.91, and noting that r is a constant, as far as the integration is concerned, I conclude that V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∞∑ n=0 1 r(n+1) ∫ (r′)nPn(cos α)ρ(r′) dτ′, (3.95) or, more explicitly, V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 [ 1 r ∫ ρ(r′) dτ′ + 1 r2 ∫ r′ cos αρ(r′) dτ′ + 1 r3 ∫ (r′)2 ( 3 2 cos2 α − 1 2 ) ρ(r′) dτ′ + ··· ]. (3.96) This is the desired result – the multipole expansion of V in powers of 1/r. The first term (n = 0) is the monopole contribution (it goes like 1/r); the second (n = 1) is the dipole (it goes like 1/r 2); the third is quadrupole; the fourth octopole; and so on. Remember that α is the angle between r and r′, so the integrals depend on the direction to the field point. If you are interested in the potential along the z′-axis (or – putting it the other way around – if you orient your r′ coordinates so the z′-axis lies along r), then α is the usual polar angle θ′. As it stands, Eq. 3.95 is exact, but it is useful primarily as an approx- imation scheme: the lowest nonzero term in the expansion provides the approximate potential at large r, and the successive terms tell us how to improve the approximation if greater precision is required. Problem 3.29. A sphere of radius R, centered at the origin, carries charge density ρ(r, θ) = k R r2 (R − 2r) sin θ, 18 This suggests a second way of defining the Legendre polynomials (the first being the Rodrigues formula); 1/ is called the generating function for Legendre polynomials. 151 3.4 Multipole Expansion where k is a constant, and r, θ are the usual spherical coordinates. Find the approximate potential for points on the z-axis, far from the sphere. Problem 3.30. A circular ring in the xy plane (radius R, centered at the origin) carries a uniform line charge λ. Find the first three terms (n = 0, 1, 2) in the multipole expansion for V (r, θ). 3.4.2 The Monopole and Dipole Terms Ordinarily, the multipole expansion is dominated (at large r)bythe monopole term: Vmon(r) = 1 4πϵ0 Q r , (3.97) where Q = ∫ ρ dτ is the total charge of the configuration. This is just what we expect for the approximate potential at large distances from the charge. For a point charge at the origin, Vmon is the exact potential, not merely a first approximation at large r; in this case, all the higher multipoles vanish. If the total charge is zero, the dominant term in the potential will be the dipole (unless, of course, it also vanishes): Vdip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r2 ∫ r′ cos αρ(r′) dτ′. Since α is the angle between r′ and r (Fig. 3.28), r′ cos α = ˆr · r′, and the dipole potential can be written more succinctly: Vdip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r2 ˆr · ∫ r′ρ(r′) dτ′. This integral (which does not depend on r) is called the dipole moment of the distribution: p ≡ ∫ r′ρ(r′) dτ′, (3.98) and the dipole contribution to the potential simplifies to Vdip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆr r2 . (3.99) The dipole moment is determined by the geometry (size, shape, and den- sity) of the charge distribution. Equation 3.98 translates in the usual way (Section 2.1.4) for point, line, and surface charges. Thus, the dipole moment of a collection of point charges is p = n∑ i=1 qir′ i . (3.100) 152 3 Potentials z y x –q +q d r r Fig. 3.29 \u0004q \u0002q \u0002q \u0004q Fig. 3.30 For a physical dipole (equal and opposite charges, ±q), p = qr′ + − qr′ − = q(r′ + − r′ −) = qd, (3.101) where d is the vector from the negative charge to the positive one (Fig. 3.29). Is this consistent with what we got in Ex. 3.10? Yes: if you put Eq. 3.101 into Eq. 3.99, you recover Eq. 3.90. Notice, however, that this is only the approximate potential of the physical dipole – evidently there are higher multipole contributions. Of course, as you go farther and farther away, Vdip becomes a better and better approximation, since the higher terms die off more rapidly with increasing r. By the same token, at a fixed r the dipole approximation improves as you shrink the separation d. To construct a perfect (ideal, pure, point) dipole whose potential is given exactly by Eq. 3.99,you’dhavetolet d approach zero. Unfortunately, you then lose the dipole term too, unless you simultaneously arrange for q to go to infinity. A physical dipole becomes a pure dipole, then, in the rather artificial limit d → 0, q →∞, with the product qd = p held fixed. When someone uses the word “dipole,” you can’t always tell whether they mean a physical dipole (with finite separation between the charges) or an ideal (point) dipole. If in doubt, assume that d is small enough (compared to r) that you can safely apply Eq. 3.99. Dipole moments are vectors, and they add accordingly: if you have two dipoles, p1 and p2, the total dipole moment is p1 + p2. For instance, with four charges at the corners of a square, as shown in Fig. 3.30, the net dipole moment is zero. You can see this by combining the charges in pairs (vertically, ↓ + ↑= 0, or horizontally, → + ←= 0) or by adding up the four contributions individually, using Eq. 3.100. This is a quadrupole,asI indicated earlier, and its potential is dominated by the quadrupole term in the multipole expansion. 153 3.4 Multipole Expansion Problem 3.31. Four particles (one of charge q, one of charge 3q, and two of charge −2q) areplacedasshown in Fig. 3.31, each a distance a from the origin. Find a simple approximate formula for the potential, valid at points far from the origin. (Express your answer in spherical coordinates.) y 3q \u00022q\u00022q x z q a a aa Fig. 3.31 Problem 3.32. In Ex. 3.9, we derived the exact potential for a spherical shell of radius R,which carries a surface charge σ = k cos θ. (a) Calculate the dipole moment of this charge distribution. (b) Find the approximate potential, at points far from the sphere, and compare the exact answer (Eq. 3.87). What can you conclude about the higher multipoles? Problem 3.33. For the dipole in Ex. 3.10,expand 1/ ± to order (d/r)3, and use this to determine the quadrupole and octopole terms in the potential. 3.4.3 Origin of Coordinates in Multipole Expansions I mentioned earlier that a point charge at the origin constitutes a “pure” monopole. If it is not at the origin, it’s no longer a pure monopole. For instance, the charge in Fig. 3.32 has a dipole moment p = qdˆy, and a corre- sponding dipole term in its potential. The monopole potential (1/4πϵ0)q/r is not quite correct for this configuration; rather, the exact potential is (1/4πϵ0)q/ . The multipole expansion is, remember, a series in inverse powers of r (the distance from the origin), and when we expand 1/ ,we get all powers, not just the first. So moving the origin (or, what amounts to the same thing, moving the charge) can radically alter a multipole expansion. The monopole moment Q does not change, since the total charge is obviously independent of the coordinate system. (In Fig. 3.32, the monopole term was unaffected when we moved q away from the origin – it’s just that it was no longer the whole story: a dipole term – and for that matter all higher poles – appeared as well.) Ordinarily, the dipole moment does change when you shift the origin, but there is an important exception: if the total charge is zero, then the dipole moment is independent of the choice of origin. For suppose we displace the origin by an amount a (Fig. 3.33). The new dipole moment is then 154 3 Potentials y z x q d r Fig. 3.32 x y x y a r\u0007 r\u0007 dτ \u0007 ¯ ¯ ¯ Fig. 3.33 (b)(a) \u0002q \u0002q q aa aqq d Fig. 3.34 ¯p = ∫ ¯r′ρ(r′) dτ′ = ∫ (r′ − a)ρ(r′) dτ′ = ∫ r′ρ(r′) dτ′ − a ∫ ρ(r′) dτ′ = p − Qa. In particular, if Q = 0, then ¯p = p. So if someone asks for the dipole moment in Fig. 3.34a, you can answer with confidence “qd,” but if you’re asked for the dipole moment in Fig. 3.34b, the appropriate response would be “With respect to what origin?” Problem 3.34. Two point charges, 3q and −q, are separated by a distance a. For each of the arrangements in Fig. 3.35, find (i) the monopole moment, (ii) the dipole moment (with respect to the origin of coordinates), and (iii) the approximate potential (in spherical coordinates) at large r (include both the monopole and dipole contributions). y 3q \u0002q \u0002q a x z (a) y 3q a x z \u0002q (b) y3qa x z (c) Fig. 3.35 3.4.4 The Electric Field of a Dipole So far we have worked only with potentials. Now I would like to calculate the electric field of a (perfect) dipole. If we choose coordinates so that p is 155 3.4 Multipole Expansion y z x p rθ φ Fig. 3.36 at the origin and points in the z direction (Fig. 3.36), then the potential at r, θ is (Eq. 3.99) Vdip(r, θ) = ˆr · p 4πϵ0r2 = p cos θ 4πϵ0r2 . (3.102) To get the field, we take the negative gradient of V : Er = − ∂V ∂r = 2p cos θ 4πϵ0r3 , Eθ = − 1 r ∂V ∂θ = p sin θ 4πϵ0r3 , Eφ = − 1 r sin θ ∂V ∂φ = 0. Thus Edip(r, θ) = p 4πϵ0r3 (2 cos θ ˆr + sin θ ˆθ). (3.103) This formula makes explicit reference to a particular coordinate system (spherical) and assumes a particular orientation for p (along z). It can be recast in a coordinate-free form, analogous to the potential in Eq. 3.99 – see Prob. 3.38. Notice that the dipole field falls off as the inverse cube of r;the monopole field (Q/4πϵ0r 2)ˆr goes as the inverse square, of course. Quadrupole fields go like 1/r 4, octopole like 1/r 5, and so on. (This reflects the fact that monopole potentials fall off like 1/r, dipole like 1/r 2, quadrupole like 1/r 3, and so on – the gradient introduces another factor of 1/r.) Figure 3.37a shows the field lines of a “pure” dipole (Eq. 3.103). For comparison, I have also sketched the field lines for a “physical” dipole, in Fig. 3.37b. Notice how similar the two pictures become if you blot out the central region; up close, however, they are entirely different. Only for points r ≫ d does Eq. 3.103 represent a valid approximation to the field of a physical dipole. As I mentioned earlier, this régime can be reached either by going to large r or by squeezing the charges very close together. 19 19 Even in the limit, there remains an infinitesimal region at the origin where the field of a physical dipole points in the “wrong” direction, as you can see by “walking” down the z- axis in Fig. 3.35b. If you want to explore this subtle and important point, see Prob. 3.52. 156 3 Potentials y z y z (a) Field of a “pure” dipole (b) Field of a “physical” dipole Fig. 3.37 Problem 3.35.

Find the approximate field E(r, θ) for points far from the sphere (r ≫ R). • Problem 3.38. Show that the electric field of a (perfect) dipole (Eq. 3.103) can be written in the coordinate-free form Edip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r3 [3(p · ˆr)ˆr − p]. (3.104) 157 More Problems on Chapter 3 More Problems on Chapter 3 Problem 3.39. In Section 3.1.4 I proved that the electrostatic potential at any point P in a charge-free region is equal to its average value over any spherical surface (radius R)centered at P. Here’s an alternative argument that does not rely on Coulomb’s law, only on Laplace’s equation. We might as well set the origin at P.Let Vave(R) be the average; first show that dVave dR = 1 4πR2 ∮ ∇V · da (note that the R2 in da cancels the 1/R2 out front, so the only dependence on R is in V itself). Now use the divergence theorem, and conclude that if V satisfies Laplace’s equation,20 then Vave(R) = Vave(0) = V (P) for all R. Problem 3.40. Here’s an alternative derivation of Eq. 3.10 (the surface charge density induced on a grounded conducted plane by a point charge q a distance d above the plane). This approach21 (which generalizes to many other problems) does not rely on the method of images. The total field is due in part to q, and in part to the induced surface charge. Write down the z components of these fields – in terms of q and the as-yet-unknown σ(x, y) –justbelow the surface. The sum must be zero, of course, because this is inside a conductor. Use that to determine σ. Problem 3.41. Two infinite parallel grounded conducting planes are held a distance a apart. A point charge q is placed in the region between them, a distance x from one plate. Find the force22 on q. Check that your answer is correct for the special cases a →∞ and x = a/2. ! Problem 3.42. Consider two conducting spheres, each of radius R and charge Q; the distance between their centers is a > 2R. The force between them was calculated in the mid-nineteenth century, by the method of images. Explain how to do it (using Ex. 3.2 and the strategy of Prob. 3.41). Show how to determine the image charges q1, q2, q3, ... , and their respective distances from the centers b1 = 0, b2, b3, ... , but don’t bother with the calculational details (we’ll save those for the next problem). Is the force always repulsive, or (as in Prob. 3.11)isthere be a critical separation below which the two spheres attract?23 Problem 3.43. (a) Implement the procedure you developed in the previous problem numerically, keeping (let us say) 10 image charges in each sphere. Plot the force, from a = 2R up to a = 10R,and 20 I thank Ted Jacobson for suggesting this proof. 21 See J. L. R. Marrero, Am.J.Phys. 78, 639 (2010). 22 Obtaining the induced surface charge is not so easy. See B. G. Dick, Am.J.Phys. 41, 1289 (1973); M. Zahn, Am.J.Phys. 44, 1132 (1976); J. Pleines and S. Mahajan, Am.J.Phys. 45, 868 (1977); and Prob. 3.55 below. 23 In the general case (unequal radii and unequal charges) there is almost always such a critical separation distance. For more on this problem see J. A. Soules, Am.J.Phys. 58, 1195 (1990); J. Lekner, Proc.R.Soc.A 468, 2829 (2012) and Am.J.Phys. 84, 474 (2016). 158 3 Potentials compare the graph you would get if the charge Q were uniformly distributed over each spherical surface.

Buckminsterfullerine is a molecule of 60 carbon atoms arranged like the stitching on a soccer ball. It may be approximated as a conducting spherical shell of radius R = 3.5 Å. A nearby electron would be attracted, according to Prob. 3.10, so it is not surprising that the ion C − 60 exists. (Imagine that the electron – on average – smears itself out uniformly over the surface.) But how about a second electron? At large distances it would be repelled by the ion, obviously, but at a certain distance r (from the center), the net force is zero, and closer than this it would be attracted. So an electron with enough energy to get in that close should bind. (a) Find r, in Å. [You’ll have to do it numerically.] (b) How much energy (in electron volts) would it take to push an electron in (from infinity) to the point r?

For example, in Prob. 3.18 you found the potential inside a cubical box, if five faces are grounded and the sixth is at a constant potential V0; by a six-fold superposition of the result, you could obtain the potential inside a cube with the faces maintained at specified constant voltages V1, V2, ... , V6.Inthisway,using Ex. 3.4 and Prob. 3.17, find the potential 24 Richard Mawhorter suggested this problem. 159 More Problems on Chapter 3 inside a rectangular pipe with two facing sides (x = ±b) at potential V0,athird(y = a)at V1,andthelast(at y = 0) grounded.

Check that your answer is consistent with the behavior of V at large r. [Answer: V (r, θ) = ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪ ⎩ aV0/r + (b3 − a3)k cos θ/3r2ϵ0, r ≥ b, aV0/r + (r3 − a3)k cos θ/3r2ϵ0, a ≤ r ≤ b. ] Problem 3.48. Acharge +Q is distributed uniformly along the z-axis from z = −a to z = +a. Show that the electric potential at a point r is given by V (r, θ) = Q 4πϵ0 1 r [1 + 1 3 ( a r ) 2P2(cos θ) + 1 5 ( a r ) 4P4(cos θ) + ··· ], for r > a. Problem 3.49. A long cylindrical shell of radius R carries a uniform surface charge σ0 on the upper half and an opposite charge −σ0 on the lower half (Fig. 3.40). Find the electric potential inside and outside the cylinder. y R x σ0 −σ0 Fig. 3.40 Problem 3.50. A thin insulating rod, running from z = − a to z =+a, carries the line charges indicated below. In each case, find the leading term in the multipole expansion of the potential: (a) λ = k cos(πz/2a),(b) λ = k sin(πz/a),(c) λ = k cos(πz/a),where k is a constant. • Problem 3.51. Show that the average field inside a sphere of radius R, due to all the charge within the sphere, is 160 3 Potentials Eave = − 1 4πϵ0 p R3 , (3.105) where p is the total dipole moment. There are several ways to prove this delightfully simple result. Here’s one method:25 (a) Show that the average field due to a single charge q at point r inside the sphere is the same as the field at r due to a uniformly charged sphere with ρ = −q/( 4 3 πR3),namely 1 4πϵ0 1 ( 4 3 πR3) ∫ q 2 ˆ dτ′, where is the vector from r to dτ′. (b) The latter can be found from Gauss’s law (see Prob. 2.13). Express the answer in terms of the dipole moment of q. (c) Use the superposition principle to generalize to an arbitrary charge distribution. (d) While you’re at it, show that the average field over the volume of a sphere, due to all the charges outside, is the same as the field they produce at the center. Problem 3.52. (a) Using Eq. 3.103, calculate the average electric field of a dipole, over a spherical volume of radius R, centered at the origin. Do the angular integrals first. [Note: You must express ˆr and ˆθ in terms of ˆx, ˆy,and ˆz (see back cover) before integrating. If you don’t understand why, reread the discussion in Section 1.4.1.] Compare your answer with the general theorem (Eq. 3.105). The discrepancy here is related to the fact that the field of a dipole blows up at r = 0. The angular integral is zero, but the radial integral is infinite, so we really don’t know what to make of the answer. To resolve this dilemma, let’s say that Eq. 3.103 applies outside a tiny sphere of radius ϵ – its contribution to Eave is then unambiguously zero, and the whole answer has to come from the field inside the ϵ-sphere. (b) What must the field inside the ϵ-sphere be, in order for the general theorem (Eq. 3.105) to hold? [Hint: Since ϵ is arbitrarily small, we’re talking about something that is infi- nite at r = 0 and whose integral over an infinitesimal volume is finite.] [Answer: −(p/3ϵ0)δ3(r).] Evidently, the true field of a dipole is Edip(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r3 [3(p · ˆr)ˆr − p] − 1 3ϵ0 pδ3(r). (3.106) You may wonder how we missed the contact term (the delta function)26 when we calculated the field back in Section 3.4.4. The answer is that the differentiation leading to Eq. 3.103 is valid 25 Another method exploits the result of Prob. 3.4. See B. Y.-K. Hu, Eur. J. Phys. 30,L29 (2009). See also Prob. 3.56b. 26 There are other ways of getting the delta-function term in the field of a dipole – my own favorite is Prob. 3.53. Note that unless you are right on top of the dipole, Eq. 3.104 is perfectly adequate. 161 More Problems on Chapter 3 except at r = 0, but we should have known (from our experience in Section 1.5.1) that the point r = 0 would be problematic.27 Problem 3.53. In Ex. 3.9, we obtained the potential of a spherical shell with surface charge σ(θ) = k cos θ.In Prob. 3.32, you found that the field is pure dipole outside; it’s uniform inside (Eq. 3.86). Show that the limit R → 0 reproduces the delta-function term in Eq. 3.106. Problem 3.54. (a) Suppose a charge distribution ρ1(r) produces a potential V1(r), and some other charge distribution ρ2(r) produces a potential V2(r). [The two situations may have nothing in common, for all I care – perhaps number 1 is a uniformly charged sphere and number 2 is a parallel-plate capacitor. Please understand that ρ1 and ρ2 are not present at the same time; we are talking about two different problems, one in which only ρ1 is present, and another in which only ρ2 is present.] Prove Green’s reciprocity theorem:28 ∫ all space ρ1V2 dτ = ∫ all space ρ2V1 dτ. (3.107) [Hint: Evaluate ∫ E1 · E2 dτ two ways, first writing E1 = −∇V1 and using integration by parts to transfer the derivative to E2, then writing E2 = −∇V2 and transferring the derivative to E1.] (b) Suppose now that you have two separated conductors (Fig. 3.41). If you charge up conductor a by amount Q (leaving b uncharged), the resulting potential of b is, say, Vab. On the other hand, if you put that same charge Q on conductor b (leaving a uncharged), the potential of a would be Vba. Use Green’s reciprocity theorem to show that Vab = Vba (an astonishing result, since we assumed nothing about the shapes or placement of the conductors). ab Q V Fig. 3.41 Problem 3.55. Use Green’s reciprocity theorem (Prob. 3.54) to solve the following problems. [Hint: For distribution 1, use the actual situation; for distribution 2, remove q and specify the charge or potential on each conductor.] 27 See C. P. Frahm, Am.J.Phys. 51, 826 (1983). For applications, see D. J. Griffiths, Am. J. Phys. 50, 698 (1982). There are other (perhaps preferable) ways of expressing the contact term in Eq. 3.106; see A. Gsponer, Eur. J. Phys. 28, 267 (2007); J. Franklin, Am.J.Phys. 78, 1225 (2010); and V. Hnizdo, Eur. J. Phys. 32, 287 (2011). 28 For interesting commentary, see B. Y.-K. Hu, Am.J.Phys. 69, 1280 (2001). 162 3 Potentials (a) Both plates of a parallel-plate capacitor are grounded, and a point charge q is placed between them at a distance x from plate 1. The plate separation is d. Find the induced charge on each plate. [Answer: Q1 = q(x/d − 1); Q2 = −qx/d.] (b) Two concentric spherical conducting shells (radii a and b) are grounded, and a point charge q is placed between them (at radius r). Find the induced charge on each sphere. (c) A point charge q is located a distance a from the center of a grounded conducting spherical shell of radius R. Find the net charge Q induced on the sphere. (Treat both cases: (i) a > R and (ii) a < R.) Problem 3.56. Green’s reciprocity theorem (Prob. 3.54) has an interesting twin: ∫ all space ρ1E2 dτ = − ∫ all space ρ2E1 dτ, (3.108) where E1 is the field that would be produced by ρ1 alone, and E2 is the field of ρ2 alone. This theorem has no name, but it amounts to a statement of Newton’s third law for electrostatics: it says that the net force of configuration 1 on configuration 2 (if both are present) is equal and opposite to the net force of 2 on 1. (a) Prove it, starting with Coulomb’s law. (As we shall discover in Chapter 8, the third law does not hold for time-dependent configurations, where Coulomb’s law is invalid; your task is to prove that it does hold in electrostatics.) (b) Suppose configuration 1 is an arbitrary charge distribution within a sphere of radius R, and configuration 2 is a uniform charge distribution filling that same spherical volume. Use Eq. 3.108 to show that the average electric field of configuration 1 over the spherical volume is given by Eq. 3.105.29 Problem 3.57. (a) Show that the quadrupole term in the multipole expansion can be written Vquad(r) = 1 4πϵ0 1 r3 3∑ i,j=1 ˆriˆrjQij (in the notation of Eq. 1.31), where Qij ≡ 1 2 ∫ [3r′ i r′ j − (r′)2δij]ρ(r′) dτ′. Here, δij = ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪ ⎩ 1 if i = j, 0 if i \u0002 j, 29 Formulas for the average field and average potential over spherical surfaces and volumes (Section 3.1.4, Probs. 3.4, 3.39, 3.51) can be obtained very efficiently using Eqs. 3.107 and 3.108. See V. Kovács and L. Pálfalvi, Eur. J. Phys. 42, 045202 (2021). 163 More Problems on Chapter 3 is the Kronecker delta,and Qij is the quadrupole moment ofthechargedistribution. Notice the hierarchy: Vmon = 1 4πϵ0 Q r , Vdip = 1 4πϵ0 ∑ ˆripi r2 , Vquad = 1 4πϵ0 ∑ ˆriˆrjQij r3 , ... . The monopole moment (Q) is a scalar, the dipole moment (p) is a vector, the quadrupole moment (Qij) is a second-rank tensor, and so on. (b) Find all nine components of Qij for the configuration in Fig. 3.30 (assume the square has side a and lies in the xy plane, centered at the origin). (c) Show that the quadrupole moment is independent of origin if the monopole and dipole moments both vanish. (This works all the way up the hierarchy – the lowest nonzero multipole moment is always independent of origin.) (d) How would you define the octopole moment? Express the octopole term in the multipole expansion in terms of the octopole moment. Problem 3.58. In Ex. 3.8 we determined the electric field outside a spherical conductor (radius R) placed in a uniform external field E0. Solve the problem now using the method of images, and check that your answer agrees with Eq. 3.76.[Hint: Use Ex. 3.2, but put another charge, −q, diametrically opposite q.Let a →∞, with (1/4πϵ0)(2q/a2) = −E0 held constant.] ! Problem 3.59. For the infinite rectangular pipe in Ex. 3.4, suppose the potential on the bottom (y = 0) and the two sides (x = ±b) is zero, but the potential on the top (y = a) is a nonzero constant V0. Find the potential inside the pipe.

Hassani, Am. J. Phys. 59, 470 (1991). 164 3 Potentials the net charge per unit length on the section opposite to V0.[Answer to both (a) and (b): λ = −(ϵ0V0/π) ln 2.]31 Problem 3.61. An ideal electric dipole is situated at the origin, and points in the z direction, as in Fig. 3.36. An electric charge is released from rest at a point in the xy plane. Show that it swings back and forth in a semicircular arc, as though it were a pendulum supported at the origin.32 Problem 3.62. A stationary electric dipole p = pˆz is situated at the origin. A positive point charge q (mass m) executes circular motion (radius s) at constant speed in the field of the dipole. Characterize the plane of the orbit. Find the speed, angular momentum, and total energy of the charge.33 [Answer: L = √ qpm/3 √3πϵ0.] Problem 3.63. Find the charge density σ(θ) on the surface of a sphere (radius R)that produces the same electric field, for points exterior to the sphere, as a charge q at the point a < R on the z-axis. [Answer: q 4πR (R2 − a2)(R2 + a2 − 2Ra cos θ)−3/2.] Problem 3.64. Consider a perfect dipole at the origin, pointing in the y direction. Using the method of Prob. 2.65, plot the field line that passes through the point (2, 0).(Youmight as well set p/(4πϵ0) → 1.) What do you suppose is the line integral ∮ E · dl around the (closed) loop? [Beware: This is a trick question. Explain your answer.] Draw a diagram with 25 field lines. [Notice that StreamPoints->25 chooses “representative”field lines, but their density is not proportional to the strength of the field, as you can see from where they cross the x-axis – they should get farther and farther apart.] Problem 3.65. [The method of relaxation] In two dimensions, ∂V ∂x = V (x + ϵ/2, y) − V (x − ϵ/2, y) ϵ , ∂V ∂y = V (x, y + ϵ/2) − V (x, y − ϵ/2) ϵ (in the limit ϵ → 0,ofcourse),so ∂2V ∂x2 = ∂ ∂x ( ∂V ∂x ) = V (x + ϵ, y) − 2V (x, y) + V (x − ϵ, y) ϵ2 (and similarly for ∂2V /∂y2). Laplace’s equation says ∂2V ∂x2 + ∂2V ∂y2 = 1 ϵ2 [ V (x + ϵ, y) + V (x − ϵ, y) + V (x, y + ϵ) + V (x, y − ϵ) − 4V (x, y)] = 0, 31 These are special cases of the Thompson–Lampard theorem; see J. D. Jackson, Am. J. Phys. 67, 107 (1999). 32 This charming result is due to R. S. Jones, Am.J.Phys. 63, 1042 (1995). 33 G. P. Sastry, V. Srinivas, and A. V. Madhav, Eur. J. Phys. 17, 275 (1996). 165 More Problems on Chapter 3 and hence V (x, y) = 1 4 [V (x + ϵ, y) + V (x − ϵ, y) + V (x, y + ϵ) + V (x, y − ϵ)]. (3.109) On a checkerboard grid, with squares of side ϵ, V is the average of its values at the four nearest neighbors (that’s for infinitesimal ϵ,butit’s approximately right for small finite ϵ). Suppose we want to solve Laplace’s equation in a rectangular region, with specified values on its boundaries. We’ll cover the region with an ϵ-grid, and start by assigning a value V (i, j) to each point (i, j); on the edges this will be the specified boundary value; at interior points it can be anything – I’ll set them all to zero. Now we go through and reassign to each interior point the average of its four neighbors, per Eq. 3.109. Then we repeat, using those updated values, and iterate the process until we find that the results are no longer changing significantly. Here’s a bare-bones implementation in Mathematica (there are many ways to improve on it – increasing its speed, accuracy, and versatility – and the same strategy can be used in three dimensions and in other mathematical contexts): For [k = 1, k <= n, k = k+1, For [i = 2, i <= r-1, i = i+1, For [j = 2, j <= c-1, j = j+1, NewV[[i,j]] = (1/4)(V[[i, j+1]] + V[[i, j-1]] + V[i-1, j]] + V[[i+1, j]])]]; V = NewV]; ListPlot3D[V] It takes as input three integers: n (the number of iterations), r (the number of rows in the grid), and c (the number of columns), as well as the list of initial values V. (Mathematica will also want to know your initial auxiliary list, NewV, but since that will immediately be changed it doesn’t matter what you put in – might as well set NewV = V.) If your grid is fairly small, you can literally type in the initial V by hand – for example: V = {{4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4}, {4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4}, {4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4}, {4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4}, {4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4}, {4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4}} To see this displayed as a grid, type MatrixForm[V]. Here the boundary values are constant (4) on the left and right edges, and 0 on the top and bottom – except in the corners, where they have been preempted; these values do not change in the course of the calculation. (a) Run that example, and compare the result with Fig. 3.21. (b) Modify the initial V so as to mimic Fig. 3.18. (c) On a 20 × 20 grid, set the perimeter to 0, but assign the four central points a potential of 4. That central potential must stay fixed, and you’ll need to figure out a way to arrange this. One possibility is to insert an “If … then”clause: If[(i==10||i==11)&& (j==10||j==11), NewV[[i,j]]=4,...] (In words, “if i = 10 or i = 11 and j = 10 or j = 11, then set NewV[[i,j]] to 4; otherwise …”.) Use n = 500. 4 Electric Fields in Matter 4.1 Polarization 4.1.1 Dielectrics In this chapter, we shall study electric fields in matter. Matter, of course, comes in many varieties – solids, liquids, gases, metals, woods, glasses – and these substances do not all respond in the same way to electrostatic fields. Nevertheless, most everyday objects belong (at least, in good approxima- tion) to one of two large classes: conductors and insulators (or dielectrics). We have already talked about conductors; these are substances that contain an “unlimited” supply of charges that are free to move about through the material. In practice, what this ordinarily means is that many of the electrons (one or two per atom, in a typical metal) are not associated with any particular nucleus, but roam around in response to applied fields. In dielectrics, by contrast, all charges are attached to specific atoms or molecules – they’re on a tight leash, and all they can do is move a bit within the atom or molecule. Such microscopic displacements are not as dramatic as the wholesale rearrangement of charge in a conductor, but their cumulative effects account for the characteristic behavior of dielectric materials. There are actually two principal mechanisms by which electric fields can distort the charge distribution of a dielectric atom or molecule: stretching and rotating. In the next two sections I’ll discuss these processes. 4.1.2 Induced Dipoles What happens to a neutral atom when it is placed in an electric field E? Your first guess might well be: “Absolutely nothing – since the atom is not charged, the field has no effect on it.” But that is incorrect. Although the atom as a whole is electrically neutral, there is a positively charged core (the nucleus) and a negatively charged electron cloud surrounding it. These two regions of charge within the atom are influenced by the field: the nucleus is pushed in the direction of the field, and the electrons the opposite way. In principle, if the field is large enough, it can pull the atom apart completely, ionizing it (the substance then becomes a conductor). With less extreme fields, however, an equilibrium is soon established, for if the center of the electron cloud does not coincide with the nucleus, these positive 167 4.1 Polarization Table 4.1. Atomic polarizabilities (α/4πϵ0,inunits of 10−30 m3). Data from Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 91st ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton (2010). H He Li Be C Ne Na Ar K Cs 0.667 0.205 24.3 5.60 1.67 0.396 24.1 1.64 43.4 59.4 and negative charges attract one another, and that holds the atom together. The two opposing forces (E pulling the electrons and nucleus apart, their mutual attraction drawing them back together) reach a balance, leaving the atom polarized, with plus charge shifted slightly one way, and minus the other. The atom now has a tiny dipole moment p, which points in the same direction as E. Typically, this induced dipole moment is approximately proportional to the field (as long as the latter is not too strong): p = αE. (4.1) The constant of proportionality α is called atomic polarizability. Its value depends on the detailed structure of the atom in question. Table 4.1 lists some experimentally determined atomic polarizabilities. Example 4.1. A primitive model for an atom consists of a point nucleus (+q) surrounded by a uniformly charged spherical cloud (−q) of radius a (Fig. 4.1). Calculate the atomic polarizability of such an atom. Solution. In the presence of an external field E, the nucleus will be shifted slightly to the right and the electron cloud to the left, as shown in Fig. 4.2. (Because the actual displacements involved are extremely small, as you’ll find in Prob. 4.1, it is reasonable to assume that the electron cloud retains its spherical shape.) Say that equilibrium occurs when the nucleus is displaced a distance d from the center of the sphere. At that point, the external field pushing the nucleus to the right exactly balances the internal field pulling it to the left: E = Ee,where Ee is the field produced by the electron cloud. Now the field at a distance d from the center of a uniformly charged sphere is Ee = 1 4πϵ0 qd a3 \u0002q \u0004q a Fig. 4.1 \u0002q d E \u0004q Fig. 4.2 168 4 Electric Fields in Matter (Prob. 2.13). At equilibrium, then, E = 1 4πϵ0 qd a3 ,or p = qd = (4πϵ0a 3)E. The atomic polarizability is therefore α = 4πϵ0a 3 = 3ϵ0v, (4.2) where v is the volume of the atom. Although this atomic model is extremely crude, the result (Eq. 4.2) is not too bad – it’s accurate to within a factor of 4 or so for many simple atoms. For molecules the situation is not quite so simple, because frequently they polarize more readily in some directions than in others. Carbon dioxide (Fig. 4.3), for instance, has a polarizability of 4.5 × 10 −40 C2m/N when you apply the field along the axis of the molecule, but only 2 × 10 −40 for fields perpendicular to this direction. When the field is at some angle to the axis, you must resolve it into parallel and perpendicular components, and multiply each by the pertinent polarizability: p = α⊥E⊥ + α ∥E ∥. In that case the induced dipole moment may not even be in the same direction as E.AndCO2 is relatively simple, as molecules go, since the atoms at least arrange themselves in a straight line; for a completely asymmetrical molecule, Eq. 4.1 is replaced by the most general linear relation between E and p: px = αxxEx + αxyEy + αxzEz, py = αyxEx + αyyEy + αyzEz, pz = αzxEx + αzyEy + αzzEz. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (4.3) The set of nine constants αij constitute the polarizability tensor for the molecule. Their values depend on the orientation of the axes you use, though it is always possible to choose “principal” axes such that all the off-diagonal terms (αxy, αzx, etc.) vanish, leaving just three nonzero polar- izabilities: αxx, αyy,and αzz. O C O Fig. 4.3 169 4.1 Polarization Problem 4.1. A hydrogen atom (with the Bohr radius of half an angstrom) is situated between two metal plates 1 mm apart, which are connected to opposite terminals of a 500 Vbattery. What fraction of the atomic radius does the separation distance d amount to, roughly? Estimate the voltage you would need with this apparatus to ionize the atom. [Use the value of α in Table 4.1. Moral: The displacements we’re talking about are minute,evenonanatomicscale.] Problem 4.2. According to quantum mechanics, the electron cloud for a hydrogen atom in its ground state has a charge density ρ(r) = q πa3 e−2r/a, where q isthechargeoftheelectron and a is the Bohr radius. Find the atomic polarizability of such an atom. [Hint: First calculate the electric field of the electron cloud, Ee(r);thenexpand the exponential, assuming r ≪ a.]1 Problem 4.3. According to Eq. 4.1, the induced dipole moment of an atom is proportional to the external field. This is a “rule of thumb,” not a fundamental law, and it is easy to concoct exceptions – in theory. Suppose, for example, the charge density of the electron cloud were proportional to the distance from the center, out to a radius R.Towhatpower of E would p be proportional in that case? Find the condition on ρ(r) such that Eq. 4.1 willholdinthe weak- field limit. Problem 4.4. A point charge q is situated a large distance r from a neutral atom of polariz- ability α. Find the force of attraction between them. 4.1.3 Alignment of Polar Molecules The neutral atom discussed in Section 4.1.2 had no dipole moment to start with; p was induced by the applied field. Some molecules have built- in, permanent dipole moments. In the water molecule, for example, the electrons tend to cluster around the oxygen atom (Fig. 4.4), and since the molecule is bent at 105◦, this leaves a negative charge at the vertex and a net positive charge on the opposite side. (The dipole moment of water is unusually large: 6.1 × 10 −30 Cm; in fact, this is what accounts for its effectiveness as a solvent.) What happens when such molecules (called polar molecules) are placed in an electric field? If the field is uniform, the force on the positive end, F+ = qE, exactly cancels the force on the negative end, F− = −qE (Fig. 4.5). However, there will be a torque: N = (r+ × F+) + (r− × F−) = [(d/2) × (qE)] + [(−d/2) × (−qE)] = qd × E. 1 For a more sophisticated approach, see W. A. Bowers, Am.J.Phys. 54, 347 (1986). 170 4 Electric Fields in Matter H + p O− H + 105º Fig. 4.4 \u0004q \u0002q F\u0004 E F\u0002 d Fig. 4.5 Thus a dipole p = qd in a uniform field E experiences a torque N = p × E. (4.4) Notice that N is in such a direction as to line p up parallel to E; a polar molecule that is free to rotate will swing around until it points in the direction of the applied field. If the field is nonuniform, so that F+ does not exactly balance F−,there will be a net force on the dipole, in addition to the torque. Of course, E must change rather abruptly for there to be significant variation in the space of one molecule, so this is not ordinarily a major consideration in discussing the behavior of dielectrics. Nevertheless, the formula for the force on a dipole in a nonuniform field is of some interest: F = F+ + F− = q(E+ − E−) = q(ΔE), where ΔE represents the difference between the field at the plus end and the field at the minus end. Assuming the dipole is very short, we may use Eq. 1.35 to approximate the small change in Ex: ΔEx ≡ (∇Ex) · d, with corresponding formulas for Ey and Ez. More compactly, ΔE = (d · ∇)E, and therefore2 F = (p · ∇)E. (4.5) For a “perfect” dipole of infinitesimal length, Eq. 4.4 gives the torque about the center of the dipole even in a nonuniform field; about any other point, N = (p × E) + (r × F). 2 In the present context, Eq. 4.5 could be written more conveniently as F = ∇(p · E).However, it is safer to stick with (p ·∇)E, because we will be applying the formula to materials in which the dipole moment (per unit volume) is itself a function of position and this alternative expression would imply (incorrectly) that p too is to be differentiated. 171 4.1 Polarization Problem 4.5. In Fig. 4.6, p1 and p2 are (perfect) dipoles a distance r apart. What is the torque on p1 due to p2? What is the torque on p2 due to p1?[Comment: In each case, I want the torque on the dipole about its own center.

(a) What is the force on p? (b) What is the force on q? 4.1.4 Polarization In the previous two sections, we considered the effect of an external electric field on an individual atom or molecule. We are now in a position to answer (qualitatively) the original question: What happens to a piece of dielectric material when it is placed in an electric field? If the substance consists of neutral atoms (or nonpolar molecules), the field will induce in each a tiny 3 This means fixed in magnitude. Beware of applying Eq. 4.6 to an induced dipole (Eq. 4.1)– it’s not incorrect, but it is not the whole story. See Prob. 4.32. 172 4 Electric Fields in Matter dipole moment, pointing in the same direction as the field.4 If the material is made up of polar molecules, each permanent dipole will experience a torque, tending to line it up along the field direction. (Random thermal motions compete with this process, so the alignment is never complete, especially at higher temperatures, and disappears almost at once when the field is removed.) Notice that these two mechanisms produce the same basic result: a lot of little dipoles pointing along the direction of the field – the material becomes polarized. A convenient measure of this effect is P ≡ dipole moment per unit volume, which is called the polarization. From now on we shall not worry much about how the polarization got there. Actually, the two mechanisms I described are not as clear-cut as I tried to pretend. Even in polar molecules there will be some polarization by displacement (though generally it is a lot easier to rotate a molecule than to stretch it, so the second mechanism dominates). It’s even possible in some materials to “freeze in” polarization, so that it persists after the field is removed. But let’s forget for a moment about the cause of the polarization; we’re going to study the field that a chunk of polarized material itself produces. Then, in Section 4.3, we’ll put it all together: the original field, which was responsible for P, plus the new field, which is due to P. 4.2 The Field of a Polarized Object 4.2.1 Bound Charges Suppose we have a piece of polarized material – that is, an object containing a lot of microscopic dipoles lined up. The dipole moment per unit volume P is given. Question: What is the field produced by this object (not the field that may have caused the polarization, but the field the polarization itself causes)? Well, we know what the field of an individual dipole looks like, so why not chop the material up into infinitesimal dipoles and integrate to get the total? As usual, it’s easier to work with the potential. For a single dipole p (Eq. 3.99), V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆ 2 , (4.8) where is the vector from the dipole to the point at which we are evaluating the potential (Fig. 4.8). In the present context, we have a dipole moment p = P dτ′ in each volume element dτ′, so the total potential is 4 In asymmetric molecules, the induced dipole moment may not be parallel to the field, but if the molecules are randomly oriented, the perpendicular contributions will average to zero. Within a single crystal, the orientations are certainly not random, and we would have to treat this case separately. 173 4.2 The FieldofaPolarizedObject p Fig. 4.8 V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V P(r′) · ˆ 2 dτ′. (4.9) That does it, in principle. But a little sleight of hand casts this integral into a much more illuminating form. Observing that ∇′ ( 1 ) = ˆ 2 , where (unlike Prob. 1.13) the differentiation is with respect to the source coordinates (r′), we have V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V P · ∇′ ( 1 ) dτ′. Integrating by parts, using product rule number 5 (inside the front cover), gives V = 1 4πϵ0 [∫ V ∇′ · ( P ) dτ′ − ∫ V 1 (∇′ · P) dτ′], or, invoking the divergence theorem, V = 1 4πϵ0 ∮ S 1 P · da′ − 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V 1 (∇′ · P) dτ′. (4.10) The first term looks like the potential of a surface charge, σb ≡ P · ˆn (4.11) (where ˆn is the normal unit vector), while the second term looks like the potential of a volume charge, ρb ≡−∇ · P. (4.12) With these definitions, Eq. 4.10 becomes V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∮ S σb da′ + 1 4πϵ0 ∫ V ρb dτ′. (4.13) This means that the potential (and hence also the field) of a polarized object is the same as that produced by a volume charge density ρb = −∇ · P plus a surface charge density σb = P · ˆn. Instead of integrating the 174 4 Electric Fields in Matter contributions of all the infinitesimal dipoles, as in Eq. 4.9, we could first find those bound charges, and then calculate the fields they produce, in the same way we calculate the field of any other volume and surface charges (for example, using Gauss’s law). Example 4.2. Find the electric field produced by a uniformly polarized sphere of radius R. Solution. We might as well choose the z-axis to coincide with the direction of polarization (Fig. 4.9). The volume bound charge density ρb is zero, since P is uniform, but σb = P · ˆn = P cos θ, where θ is the usual spherical coordinate. What we want, then, is the field produced by a charge density P cos θ plastered over the surface of a sphere. But we already computed the potential of such a configuration (Eqs. 3.86 and 3.87): V (r, θ) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ P 3ϵ0 r cos θ for r ≤ R, P 3ϵ0 R3 r2 cos θ for r ≥ R. Since r cos θ = z,the field inside the sphere is uniform: E = −∇V = − P 3ϵ0 ˆz = − 1 3ϵ0 P for r < R. (4.14) This remarkable result will be very useful in what follows. Outside the sphere the potential is identical to that of a perfect dipole at the origin, V = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆr r2 for r ≥ R, (4.15) whose dipole moment is, not surprisingly, equal to the total dipole moment of the sphere: p = 4 3 πR3P. (4.16) The field of the uniformly polarized sphere is shown in Fig. 4.10. P R z n θ ˆ Fig. 4.9 175 4.2 The FieldofaPolarizedObject Fig. 4.10 Problem 4.10. A sphere of radius R carries a polarization P(r) = kr, where k is a constant and r is the vector from the center. (a) Calculate the bound charges σb and ρb. (b) Find the field inside and outside the sphere. Problem 4.11. A short cylinder, of radius a and length L, carries a “frozen-in”uniform polar- ization P, parallel to its axis. Find the bound charge, and sketch the electric field (i) for L ≫ a, (ii) for L ≪ a, and (iii) for L ≈ a. [This is known as a bar electret; it is the electrical analog to a bar magnet. In practice, only very special materials – barium titanate is the most “familiar” example – will hold a permanent electric polarization. That’s why you can’t buy electrets at the toy store.] Problem 4.12. Calculate the potential of a uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2) directly from Eq. 4.9. 4.2.2 Physical Interpretation of Bound Charges In the last section we found that the field of a polarized object is identical to the field that would be produced by a certain distribution of “bound charges,” σb and ρb. But this conclusion emerged in the course of abstract manipulations of the integral in Eq. 4.9, and left us with no clue as to the physical meaning of these bound charges. Indeed, some authors give you the impression that bound charges are in some sense “fictitious” – mere bookkeeping devices used to facilitate the calculation of fields. Nothing could be further from the truth: ρb and σb represent perfectly genuine 176 4 Electric Fields in Matter \u0002\u0002 \u0004\u0002\u0006\u0004 \u0002\u0004 \u0002\u0004 \u0002\u0004 \u0002\u0004\u0004 Fig. 4.11 \u0002q \u0004qA d \u0006 Fig. 4.12 Aend A P n θ ˆ Fig. 4.13 accumulations of charge. In this section I’ll explain how polarization leads to these charge distributions. The basic idea is very simple: Suppose we have a long string of dipoles, as shown in Fig. 4.11. Along the line, the head of one effectively cancels the tail of its neighbor, but at the ends there are two charges left over: plus at the right-hand end and minus at the left. It is as if we had peeled off an electron at one end and carried it all the way down to the other end, though in fact no single electron made the whole trip – a lot of tiny displacements add up to one large one. We call the net charge at the ends bound charge to remind ourselves that it cannot be removed; in a dielectric every electron is attached to a specific atom or molecule. But apart from that, bound charge is no different from any other kind. To calculate the actual amount of bound charge resulting from a given polarization, examine a “tube” of dielectric parallel to P. The dipole moment of the tiny chunk shown in Fig. 4.12 is P(Ad),where A is the cross- sectional area of the tube and d is the length of the chunk. In terms of the charge (q) at the end, this same dipole moment can be written as qd.The bound charge that piles up at the right-hand end of the tube is therefore q = PA. If the ends have been sliced off perpendicularly, the surface charge density is σb = q A = P. For an oblique cut (Fig. 4.13), the charge is still the same, but A = Aend cos θ, so σb = q Aend = P cos θ = P · ˆn. The effect of the polarization, then, is to paint a bound charge σb = P · ˆn over the surface of the material. This is exactly what we found by more rigorous means in Section 4.2.1. But now we know where the bound charge comes from. If the polarization is nonuniform, we get accumulations of bound charge within the material, as well as on the surface. A glance at Fig. 4.14 suggests 177 4.2 The FieldofaPolarizedObject \u0004 \u0004\u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0002 Fig. 4.14 that a diverging P results in a pileup of negative charge. Indeed, the net bound charge ∫ ρb dτ in a given volume is equal and opposite to the amount that has been pushed out through the surface. The latter (by the same reasoning we used before) is P · ˆn per unit area, so ∫ V ρb dτ = − ∮ S P · da = − ∫ V(∇ · P) dτ. Since this is true for any volume, we have ρb = −∇ · P, confirming, again, the more rigorous conclusion of Section 4.2.1. Example 4.3. There is another way of analyzing the uniformly polar- ized sphere (Ex. 4.2), which nicely illustrates the idea of a bound charge. What we have, really, is two spheres of charge: a positive sphere and a negative sphere. Without polarization the two are super- imposed, and cancel completely. But when the material is uniformly polarized, all the plus charges move slightly upward (the z direc- tion), and all the minus charges move slightly downward (Fig. 4.15). The two spheres no longer coincide perfectly: at the top there’s a “cap” of leftover positive charge and at the bottom a cap of neg- ative charge. This “leftover” charge is precisely the bound surface charge σb. \u0004 \u0004 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004\u0004 \u0004 d \u0004 \u0002 Fig. 4.15 178 4 Electric Fields in Matter In Prob. 2.19, you calculated the field in the region of overlap between two oppositely charged spheres; the answer was E = − 1 4πϵ0 qd R3 , where q is the total charge of the positive sphere, d is the vector from the negative center to the positive center, and R is the radius of the sphere. We can express this in terms of the polarization of the sphere, p = qd = ( 4 3 πR3)P,as E = − 1 3ϵ0 P. Meanwhile, for points outside, it is as though all the charge on each sphere were concentrated at the respective centers. We have, then, a dipole, with potential V = 1 4πϵ0 p · ˆr r2 . (Remember that d is some small fraction of an atomic radius; Fig. 4.15 is grossly exaggerated.) These answers agree, of course, with the results of Ex. 4.2. Problem 4.13. A very long cylinder, of radius a, carries a uniform polarization P perpendicular to its axis. Find the electric field inside the cylinder. Show that the field outside the cylinder can be expressed in the form E(r) = a2 2ϵ0s2 [2(P · ˆs)ˆs − P]. [Careful: I said “uniform,”not “radial”!] Problem 4.14. When you polarize a neutral dielectric, the charge moves a bit, but the total remains zero. This fact should be reflected in the bound charges σb and ρb.Prove from Eqs. 4.11 and 4.12 that the total bound charge vanishes. 4.2.3 Microscopic and Macroscopic Fields I have been sloppy about the distinction between “pure” dipoles and “physical” dipoles.5 In developing the theory of bound charges, I assumed we were working with the pure kind – indeed, I started with Eq. 4.8, the formula for the potential of a perfect dipole. And yet, an actual polarized dielectric consists of physical dipoles, albeit extremely tiny ones. What is more, I presumed to represent discrete molecular dipoles by a continuous density function P. How can I justify this method? Outside 5 This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 179 4.2 The FieldofaPolarizedObject the dielectric there is no real problem: here we are far away from the molecules ( is many times greater than the separation distance between plus and minus charges), so the dipole potential dominates overwhelm- ingly and the detailed “graininess” of the source is blurred by distance. Inside the dielectric, however, we can hardly pretend to be far from all the dipoles, and the procedure I used in Section 4.2.1 is open to serious challenge. In fact, when you stop to think about it, the electric field inside matter must be fantastically complicated, on the microscopic level. If you happen to be very near an electron, the field is gigantic, whereas a short distance away it may be small or point in a totally different direction. Moreover, an instant later, as the charges move around, the field will have altered entirely. This true microscopic field would be utterly impossible to calculate; and it wouldn’t be of much interest if you could. Just as, for macroscopic purposes, we regard water as a continuous fluid, ignoring its molecular structure, so also we can ignore the microscopic bumps and wrinkles in the electric field inside matter, and concentrate on the macroscopic field. This is defined as the average field over regions large enough to contain many thousands of atoms (so that the uninteresting microscopic fluctuations are smoothed over), and yet small enough to ensure that we do not wash out any significant large-scale variations in the field. (In practice, this means we must average over regions much smaller than the dimensions of the object itself.) Ordinarily, the macroscopic field is what people mean when they speak of “the” field inside matter.6 But is the macroscopic field what we actually get, when we use the methods of Section 4.2.1? The argument is subtle, so hang on. Suppose I want to calculate the macroscopic field at some point r within a dielectric (Fig. 4.16). I know I must average the true (microscopic) field over an appropriate volume, so let me draw a small sphere about r, of radius, say, a thousand times the size of a molecule. The macroscopic field at r, then, consists of two parts: the average field over the sphere due to all charges outside, plus the average due to all charges inside: E = Eout + Ein. r R Fig. 4.16 6 In case the notion of macroscopic fields sounds suspicious to you, let me point out that you do exactly the same averaging whenever you speak of the density of a material. 180 4 Electric Fields in Matter You proved in Prob. 3.51d that the average field (over a sphere), produced by charges outside, is equal to the field they produce at the center, so Eout is the field at r due to the dipoles exterior to the sphere. These are far enough away that we can safely use Eq. 4.9: Vout = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ outside P(r′) · ˆ 2 dτ′. (4.17) The dipoles inside the sphere are too close to treat in this fashion. But fortu- nately all we need is their average field, and that, according to Eq. 3.105,is Ein = − 1 4πϵ0 p R3 , regardless of the details of the charge distribution within the sphere. The only relevant quantity is the total dipole moment, p = ( 4 3 πR3)P: Ein = − 1 3ϵ0 P. (4.18) Now, by assumption, the sphere is small enough that P does not vary significantly over its volume, so the term left out of the integral in Eq. 4.17 corresponds to the field at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere, to wit, −(1/3ϵ0)P (Eq. 4.14). But this is precisely what Ein (Eq. 4.18) puts back in! The macroscopic field, then, is given by the potential V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ P(r′) · ˆ 2 dτ′, (4.19) where the integral runs over the entire volume of the dielectric. This is exactly what we used in Section 4.2.1; without realizing it, we were correctly calculating the averaged, macroscopic field, for points inside the dielectric. You may have to reread the last couple of paragraphs for the argument to sink in. Notice that it all revolves around the curious fact that the average field over any sphere (due to the charge inside) is the same as the field at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere with the same total dipole moment. This means that no matter how crazy the actual microscopic charge configuration, we can replace it by a nice smooth distribution of perfect dipoles, if all we want is the macroscopic (average) field. Inciden- tally, while the argument ostensibly relies on the spherical shape I chose to average over, the macroscopic field is certainly independent of the geometry of the averaging region, and this is reflected in the final answer, Eq. 4.19. Presumably one could reproduce the same argument for a cube or an ellipsoid or whatever – the calculation might be more difficult, but the conclusion would be the same. 181 4.3 The Electric Displacement 4.3 The Electric Displacement 4.3.1 Gauss’s Law in the Presence of Dielectrics In Section 4.2 we found that the effect of polarization is to produce accumulations of (bound) charge, ρb = −∇ · P within the dielectric and σb = P · ˆn on the surface. The field due to polarization of the medium is just the field of this bound charge. We are now ready to put it all together: the field attributable to bound charge plus the field due to everything else (which, for want of a better term, we call free charge, ρf ). The free charge might consist of electrons on a conductor or ions embedded in the dielectric material or whatever; any charge, in other words, that is not associated with P. Within the dielectric, the total charge density can be written ρ = ρb + ρf , (4.20) and Gauss’s law reads ϵ0∇ · E = ρ = ρb + ρf = −∇ · P + ρf , where E is now the total field, not just the part generated by polarization. It is convenient to combine the two divergence terms: ∇ · (ϵ0E + P) = ρf . The expression in parentheses, designated by the letter D, D ≡ ϵ0E + P, (4.21) is known as the electric displacement. In terms of D, Gauss’s law reads ∇ · D = ρf , (4.22) or, in integral form, ∮ D · da = Qfenc, (4.23) where Qfenc denotes the total free charge enclosed in the volume. This is a particularly useful way to express Gauss’s law, in the context of dielectrics, because it makes reference only to free charges, and free charge is the stuff we control. Bound charge comes along for the ride: when we put the free charge in place, a certain polarization automatically ensues, by the mechanisms of Section 4.1, and this polarization produces the bound charge. In a typical problem, therefore, we know ρf , but we do not (initially) know ρb; Eq. 4.23 lets us go right to work with the information at hand. In particular, whenever the requisite symmetry is present, we can immediately calculate D by the standard Gauss’s law methods. 182 4 Electric Fields in Matter Example 4.4. A long straight wire, carrying uniform line charge λ,is surrounded by rubber insulation out to a radius a (Fig. 4.17). Find the electric displacement. s L Gaussian surface aλ Fig. 4.17 Solution. Drawing a cylindrical Gaussian surface, of radius s and length L, and applying Eq. 4.23, we find D(2πsL) = λL. Therefore, D = λ 2πsˆs. (4.24) Notice that this formula holds both within the insulation and outside it. In the latter region, P = 0,so E = 1 ϵ0 D = λ 2πϵ0sˆs for s > a. Inside the rubber, the electric field cannot be determined, since we do not know P. It may appear to you that I left out the surface bound charge σb in deriving Eq. 4.22, and in a sense that is true. We cannot apply Gauss’s law precisely at the surface of a dielectric, for here ρb blows up, 7 taking the divergence of E with it. But everywhere else the logic is sound, and in fact if we picture the edge of the dielectric as having some finite thickness, within which the polarization tapers off to zero (probably a more realistic model than an abrupt cutoff anyway), then there is no surface bound charge; ρb varies rapidly but smoothly within this “skin,” and Gauss’s law can be safely applied everywhere. At any rate, the integral form (Eq. 4.23)isfree from this “defect.” Problem 4.15. A thick spherical shell (inner radius a, outer radius b) is made of dielectric material with a “frozen-in”polarization P(r) = k r ˆr, 7 The polarization drops abruptly to zero outside the material, so its derivative is a delta function (see Prob. 1.46). The surface bound charge is precisely this term – in this sense it is actually included in ρb, but we ordinarily prefer to handle it separately as σb. 183 4.3 The Electric Displacement a bP P P P Fig. 4.18 (a) Sphere (b) Needle (c) Wafer P Fig. 4.19 where k is a constant and r is the distance from the center (Fig. 4.18). (There is no free charge in the problem.) Find the electric field in all three regions by two different methods: (a) Locate all the bound charge, and use Gauss’s law (Eq. 2.13) to calculate the field it produces. (b) Use Eq. 4.23 to find D, and then get E from Eq. 4.21. [Notice that the second method is much faster, and it avoids any explicit reference to the bound charges.] Problem 4.16. Suppose the field inside a large piece of dielectric is E0, so that the electric displacement is D0 = ϵ0E0 + P. (a) Now a small spherical cavity (Fig. 4.19a) is hollowed out of the material. Find the field at the center of the cavity in terms of E0 and P. Also find the displacement at the center of the cavity in terms of D0 and P. Assume the polarization is “frozen in,”so it doesn’t change when the cavity is excavated. (b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to P (Fig. 4.19b). (c) Do the same for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to P (Fig. 4.19c). Assume the cavities are small enough that P, E0,and D0 are essentially uniform. [Hint: Carving out a cavity is the same as superimposing an object of the same shape but opposite polarization.] 4.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel Equation 4.22 looks just like Gauss’s law, only the total charge density ρ is replaced by the free charge density ρf ,and D is substituted for ϵ0E. For this reason, you may be tempted to conclude that D is “just like” E (apart from the factor ϵ0), except that its source is ρf instead of ρ: “To solve problems involving dielectrics, you just forget all about the bound charge – calculate the field as you ordinarily would, only call the answer D instead of E.” This reasoning is seductive, but the conclusion is false; in particular, there is no “Coulomb’s law” for D: D(r) \u0002 1 4π ∫ ˆ 2 ρf (r′) dτ′. The parallel between E and D is more subtle than that. 184 4 Electric Fields in Matter For the divergence alone is insufficient to determine a vector field; you need to know the curl as well. One tends to forget this in the case of electrostatic fields because the curl of E is always zero. But the curl of D is not always zero: ∇ × D = ϵ0(∇ × E) + (∇ × P) = ∇ × P, (4.25) and there is no reason, in general, to suppose that the curl of P vanishes. Sometimes it does, as in Ex. 4.4 and Prob. 4.15, but more often it does not. The bar electret of Prob. 4.11 is a case in point: here there is no free charge anywhere, so if you really believe that the only source of D is ρf , you will be forced to conclude that D = 0 everywhere, and hence that E = (−1/ϵ0)P inside and E = 0 outside the electret, which is obviously wrong. (I leave it for you to find the place where ∇ × P \u0002 0 in this problem.) Because ∇ × D \u0002 0, moreover, D cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar – there is no “potential” for D. Advice: When you are asked to compute the electric displacement, first look for symmetry. If the problem exhibits spherical, cylindrical, or plane symmetry, then you can get D directly from Eq. 4.23 by the usual Gauss’s law methods. (Evidently, in such cases ∇ × P is automatically zero, but since symmetry alone dictates the answer, you’re not really obliged to worry about the curl.) If the requisite symmetry is absent, you’ll have to think of another approach, and, in particular, you must not assume that D is determined exclusively by the free charge. 4.3.3 Boundary Conditions The electrostatic boundary conditions of Section 2.3.5 can be recast in terms of D. Equation 4.23 tells us the discontinuity in the component perpendicular to an interface: D ⊥ above − D ⊥ below = σf , (4.26) while Eq. 4.25 gives the discontinuity in parallel components: D ∥ above − D ∥ below = P ∥ above − P ∥ below. (4.27) In the presence of dielectrics, these are sometimes more useful than the corresponding boundary conditions on E (Eqs. 2.31 and 2.32): E⊥ above − E⊥ below = 1 ϵ0 σ, (4.28) and E ∥ above − E ∥ below = 0. (4.29) You might try applying them, for example, to Probs. 4.16 and 4.17. 185 4.3 The Electric Displacement Problem 4.17. For the bar electret of Prob. 4.11, make three careful sketches: one of P,one of E,and oneof D. Assume L is about 2a.[Hint: E lines terminate on charges; D lines terminate on free charges.] 4.3.4 The Crystal Ambiguity I began this chapter 8 with a description of dielectrics as neutral atoms or molecules that can be stretched or rotated by an electric field to form a collection of microscopic aligned dipoles. But what about an ionic crystal, such as ordinary table salt? It’s a matrix of positive sodium ions (Na +)and negative chlorine ions (Cl−), as indicated schematically in Fig. 4.20. It’s not a conductor (the electrons are attached to particular atoms); it behaves, in fact, as a kind of dielectric. But it does raise an intriguing puzzle: What is its polarization, P? You see, it’s not clear which chlorine ion should be associated with a given sodium ion, to make a dipole p – the one above, or the one below, or the one to the left, or the one to the right? If you pick the ones below (Fig. 4.21a), then all the dipoles will be pointing upward, if you pick the ones above, they’re all pointing downward (Fig. 4.21b); pick the ones to the left, and the dipoles all point to the right (Fig. 4.21c), pick the ones to the right, and the dipoles all point to the left (Fig. 4.21d). So P could point up, down, left, or right (or for that matter in, or out), depending on how you decide to form the dipoles! In each case there will be some leftover charges at the edges, Fig. 4.20 (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 4.21 8 This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 186 4 Electric Fields in Matter Fig. 4.22 which (since they are not associated with the basic dipoles) we identify as “free” charge, σf . It exactly cancels the “bound” surface charge, σb,ineach case. But where it is located, and what sign it carries, depends (again) on our arbitrary choice. So not only is the polarization ambiguous, but so too is the distinction between free and bound charge. We could even arrange for zero polarization (Fig. 4.22), with no free or bound charge. Indeed, in some sense this is the most “natural” choice. But in truth all of these different arrangements are equally “correct”; they all represent the same physical configuration. What we have discovered is that (at least in the case of ionic crystals), the notions of “dipole moment per unit volume,” “free charge,” and “bound charge” (and therefore also the electric displacement D) are intrinsically ill defined. But it doesn’t really matter. What matters is the total charge ρ.Inthe salt crystal (Fig. 4.20) everybody agrees that the total (macroscopic) charge density is zero, and the (macroscopic) electric field vanishes; they argue only about how to chop the charge into free and bound parts, and how to com- bine the ions to form dipoles. At the end of the day, it is changes in polariza- tion (when, for example, you turn on a field and the ions adjust slightly in response) that carry genuine significance. This is where the physics resides, not in the story we tell ourselves to help us visualize what is happening. 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 4.4.1 Susceptibility, Permittivity, Dielectric Constant In Sections 4.2 and 4.3 we did not commit ourselves as to the cause of P; we dealt only with the effects of polarization. From the qualitative discussion of Section 4.1, though, we know that the polarization of a dielectric ordinarily results from an applied electric field, which lines up the atomic or molecular dipoles. For many substances, in fact, the polarization is proportional to the field, provided E is not too strong: 9 P = ϵ0χeE. (4.30) 9 Notice that Eq. 4.30 removes any ambiguity in the case of crystal dielectrics (Section 4.3.4). 187 4.4 Linear Dielectrics The constant of proportionality, χe, is called the electric susceptibility of the medium (a factor of ϵ0 hasbeen extractedtomake χe dimensionless). The value of χe depends on the microscopic structure of the substance in question (and also on external conditions such as temperature). I shall call materials that obey Eq. 4.30 linear dielectrics. 10 Note that E in Eq. 4.30 is the total field; it may be due in part to free charges and in part to the polarization itself. If, for instance, we put a piece of dielectric into an external field E0, we cannot compute P directly from Eq. 4.30; the external field will polarize the material, and this polarization will produce its own field, which then contributes to the total field, and this in turn modifies the polarization, which …. Breaking out of this infinite regress is not always easy. You’ll see some examples in a moment. The simplest approach is to begin with the displacement, at least in those cases where D can be deduced directly from the free charge distribution. In linear media we have D = ϵ0E + P = ϵ0E + ϵ0χeE = ϵ0(1 + χe)E, (4.31) so D is also proportional to E: D = ϵE, (4.32) where ϵ ≡ ϵ0(1 + χe). (4.33) This new constant ϵ is called the permittivity of the material. (In vacuum, where there is no matter to polarize, the susceptibility is zero, and the permittivity is ϵ0.That’swhy ϵ0 is called the permittivity of free space.I dislike the term, for it suggests that the vacuum is just a special kind of linear dielectric, in which the permittivity happens to have the value 8.85 × 10 −12 C2/Nm2.) If you remove a factor of ϵ0, the remaining dimensionless quantity, ϵr ≡ 1 + χe = ϵ ϵ0 , (4.34) is called the relative permittivity,or dielectric constant, of the material. Dielectric constants for some common substances are listed in Table 4.2. (Notice that ϵr is greater than 1, for all ordinary materials; this just reflects the fact that polarization is typically in the same direction as the field.) Of course, the permittivity and the dielectric constant do not convey any information that was not already available in the susceptibility, nor is there anything essentially new in Eq. 4.32;the physics of linear dielectrics is all contained in Eq. 4.30.11 10 In modern optical applications especially, nonlinear materials have become increasingly important. For these there is a second term in the formula for P as a function of E – typically a cubic term. In general, Eq. 4.30 can be regarded as the first (nonzero) term in the Taylor expansion of P in powers of E. 11 As long as we are engaged in this excess of unnecessary terminology and notation, I might as well mention that formulas for D in terms of E (Eq. 4.32, in the case of linear dielectrics) are called constitutive relations. 188 4 Electric Fields in Matter Table 4.2.

A metal sphere of radius a carries a charge Q (Fig. 4.23). It is surrounded, out to radius b, by linear dielectric material of permittivity ϵ. Find the potential at the center (relative to infinity). Solution. To compute V , we need to know E; to find E, we might first try to locate the bound charge; we could get the bound charge from P, but we can’t calculate P unless we already know E (Eq. 4.30). We seem to be in a bind. What we do know is the free charge Q, and fortunately the arrangement is spherically symmetric, so let’s begin by calculating D, using Eq. 4.23: D = Q 4πr2 ˆr for all points r > a. (Inside the metal sphere, of course, E = P = D = 0.) Once we know D, it is a trivial matter to obtain E, using Eq. 4.32: E = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ Q 4πϵr2 ˆr for a < r < b, Q 4πϵ0r2 ˆr for r > b. The potential at the center is therefore V = − ∫ 0 ∞ E · dl = − ∫ b ∞ ( Q 4πϵ0r2 ) dr − ∫ a b ( Q 4πϵr2 ) dr − ∫ 0 a (0) dr = Q 4π ( 1 ϵ0b + 1 ϵa − 1 ϵb ). a b Q Fig. 4.23 189 4.4 Linear Dielectrics As it turns out, it was not necessary for us to compute the polariza- tion or the bound charge explicitly, though this can easily be done: P = ϵ0χeE = ϵ0χeQ 4πϵr2 ˆr, in the dielectric, and hence ρb = −∇ · P = 0, while σb = P · ˆn = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ ϵ0χeQ 4πϵb2 at the outer surface, −ϵ0χeQ 4πϵa2 at the inner surface. Notice that the surface bound charge at a is negative (ˆn points outward with respect to the dielectric,whichis +ˆr at b but −ˆr at a). This is natural, since the charge on the metal sphere attracts its opposite in all the dielectric molecules. It is this layer of negative charge that reduces the field, within the dielectric, from 1/4πϵ0(Q/r 2)ˆr to 1/4πϵ(Q/r 2)ˆr.In this respect, a dielectric is rather like an imperfect conductor: on a conducting shell the induced surface charge would be such as to cancel the field of Q completely in the region a < r < b; the dielectric does the best it can, but the cancelation is only partial. You might suppose that linear dielectrics escape the defect in the parallel between E and D. Since P and D are now proportional to E, does it not follow that their curls, like E’s, must vanish? Unfortunately, it does not, for the line integral of P around a closed path that straddles the boundary between one type of material and another need not be zero, even though the integral of E around the same loop must be. The reason is that the proportionality factor ϵ0χe is different on the two sides. For instance, at the interface between a polarized dielectric and the vacuum (Fig. 4.24), P is zero on one side but not on the other. Around this loop ∮ P · dl \u0002 0, and hence, by Stokes’ theorem, the curl of P cannot vanish everywhere within the loop (in fact, it is infinite at the boundary). 12 Of course, if the space is entirely filled with a homogeneous 13 linear dielectric, then this objection is void; in this rather special circumstance, Vacuum Dielectric P 0 P ≠ 0 Fig. 4.24 12 Putting that argument in differential form, Eq. 4.30 and product rule 7 yield ∇×P = −ϵ0E× (∇χe), so the problem arises when ∇χe is not parallel to E. 13 A homogeneous medium is one whose properties (in this case the susceptibility) do not vary with position. 190 4 Electric Fields in Matter \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 q Fig. 4.25 ∇ · D = ρf and ∇ × D = 0, so D can be found from the free charge just as though the dielectric were not there: D = ϵ0Evac, where Evac is the field the same free charge distribution would produce in the absence of any dielectric. According to Eqs. 4.32 and 4.34, therefore, E = 1 ϵ D = 1 ϵr Evac. (4.35) Conclusion: When all space is filled with a homogeneous linear dielectric, the field everywhere is simply reduced by a factor of one over the dielectric constant. (Actually, it is not necessary for the dielectric to fill all space: in regions where the field is zero anyway, it can hardly matter whether the dielectric is present or not, since there’s no polarization in any event.) For example, if a free charge q is embedded in a large dielectric, the field it produces is E = 1 4πϵ q r2 ˆr (4.36) (that’s ϵ, not ϵ0), and the force it exerts on nearby charges is reduced accordingly. But it’s not that there is anything wrong with Coulomb’s law; rather, the polarization of the medium partially “shields” the charge, by surrounding it with bound charge of the opposite sign (Fig. 4.25).14 Example 4.6. A parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.26) is filled with insu- lating material of dielectric constant ϵr. What effect does this have on its capacitance? Solution. Since the field is confined to the space between the plates, the dielectric will reduce E, and hence also the potential difference V , 14 In quantum electrodynamics, the vacuum itself can be polarized, and this means that the effective (or “renormalized”) charge of the electron, as you might measure it in the laboratory, is not its true (“bare”) value, and in fact depends slightly on how far away you are! 191 4.4 Linear Dielectrics Dielectric Fig. 4.26 byafactor1/ϵr. Accordingly, the capacitance C = Q/V is increased by a factor of the dielectric constant, C = ϵrCvac. (4.37) This is, in fact, a common way to beef up a capacitor. A crystal is generally easier to polarize in some directions than in others,15 andinthis case Eq. 4.30 is replaced by the general linear relation Px = ϵ0(χexx Ex + χexyEy + χexz Ez), Py = ϵ0(χeyx Ex + χeyy Ey + χeyz Ez), Pz = ϵ0(χezx Ex + χezyEy + χezzEz), ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (4.38) just as Eq. 4.1 was superseded by Eq. 4.3 for asymmetrical molecules. The nine coefficients, χexx , χexy , ... , constitute the susceptibility tensor. Problem 4.18. The space between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.27) is filled with two slabs of linear dielectric material. Each slab has thickness a, so the total distance between theplatesis 2a. Slab 1 has a dielectric constant of 2, and slab 2 has a dielectric constant of 1.5. The free charge density on the top plate is σ and on the bottom plate −σ. (a) Find the electric displacement D in each slab. (b) Find the electric field E in each slab. (c) Find the polarization P in each slab. (d) Find the potential difference between the plates. (e) Find the location and amount of all bound charge. 15 A medium is said to be isotropic if its properties (such as susceptibility) are the same in all directions. Thus Eq. 4.30 is the special case of Eq. 4.38 that holds for isotropic media. Physicists tend to be careless with their language, and unless otherwise indicated the term “linear dielectric” implies “isotropic linear dielectric,” and suggests “homogeneous isotropic linear dielectric.” But technically, “linear” just means that at any given point,and for E in a given direction, the components of P are proportional to E – the proportionality factor could vary with position and/or direction. 192 4 Electric Fields in Matter Slab 1 a a \u0002σ \u0004σ Slab 2 Fig. 4.27 (f) Now that you know all the charge (free and bound), recalculate the field in each slab, and confirm your answer to (b). Problem 4.19. Suppose you have just enough linear dielectric material, of dielectric constant ϵr,to half fill a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.28). By how much is the capacitance increased when you distribute the material as in Fig. 4.28a? How about Fig. 4.28b? For a given potential difference V between the plates, find E, D,and P,ineachregion, andthe free andbound charge on all surfaces, for both cases. (b)(a) Fig. 4.28 Problem 4.20. A sphere of linear dielectric material has embedded in it a uniform free charge density ρ. Find the potential at the center of the sphere (relative to infinity), if its radius is R and the dielectric constant is ϵr. Problem 4.21. A certain coaxial cable consists of a copper wire, radius a, surrounded by a concentric copper tube of inner radius c (Fig. 4.29). The space between is partially filled (from b out to c) with material of dielectric constant ϵr, as shown. Find the capacitance per unit length of this cable. a b c Fig. 4.29 193 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 4.4.2 Boundary Value Problems with Linear Dielectrics In a (homogeneous isotropic) linear dielectric, the bound charge density (ρb) is proportional to the free charge density (ρf ): 16 ρb = −∇ · P = −∇ · (ϵ0 χe ϵ D) = −( χe 1 + χe ) ρf . (4.39) In particular, unless free charge is actually embedded in the material, ρ = 0, and any net charge must reside at the surface. Within such a dielectric, then, the potential obeys Laplace’s equation, and all the machinery of Chapter 3 carries over. It is convenient to rewrite the boundary conditions in a way that makes reference only to the free charge. Equation 4.26 says ϵaboveE⊥ above − ϵbelowE⊥ below = σf , (4.40) or (in terms of the potential), ϵabove ∂Vabove ∂n − ϵbelow ∂Vbelow ∂n = −σf , (4.41) whereas the potential itself is, of course, continuous (Eq. 2.34): Vabove = Vbelow. (4.42) Example 4.7. A sphere of homogeneous linear dielectric material is placed in an otherwise uniform electric field E0 (Fig. 4.30). Find the electric field inside the sphere. Solution. This is reminiscent of Ex. 3.8, in which an uncharged conducting sphere was introduced into a uniform field. In that case, the field of the induced charge cancels E0 within the sphere; in a dielectric, the cancelation (from the bound charge) is incomplete. Our problem is to solve Laplace’s equation, for Vin(r, θ) when r ≤ R,and Vout(r, θ) when r ≥ R, subject to the boundary conditions E0 E Fig. 4.30 16 This does not apply to the surface charge (σb), because χe is not independent of position (obviously) at the boundary. 194 4 Electric Fields in Matter (i) Vin = Vout at r = R, (ii) ϵ ∂Vin ∂r = ϵ0 ∂Vout ∂r at r = R, (iii) Vout →−E0r cos θ for r ≫ R. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (4.43) (The second of these follows from Eq. 4.41, since there is no free charge at the surface.) Inside the sphere, Eq. 3.65 says Vin(r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Alr lPl (cos θ); (4.44) outside the sphere, in view of (iii), we have Vout(r, θ) = −E0r cos θ + ∞∑ l=0 Bl rl+1 Pl (cos θ). (4.45) Boundary condition (i) requires that ∞∑ l=0 AlRlPl (cos θ) = −E0R cos θ + ∞∑ l=0 Bl Rl+1 Pl (cos θ), so 17 AlRl = Bl Rl+1 for l \u0002 1, A1R = −E0R + B1 R2 . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (4.46) Meanwhile, condition (ii) yields ϵr ∞∑ l=0 lAlRl−1Pl (cos θ) = −E0 cos θ − ∞∑ l=0 (l + 1)Bl Rl+2 Pl (cos θ), so ϵrlAlRl−1 = − (l + 1)Bl Rl+2 for l \u0002 1, ϵrA1 = −E0 − 2B1 R3 . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (4.47) It follows that Al = Bl = 0for l \u0002 1, A1 = − 3 ϵr + 2 E0, B1 = ϵr − 1 ϵr + 2 R3E0. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (4.48) Evidently, Vin(r, θ) = − 3E0 ϵr + 2 r cos θ = − 3E0 ϵr + 2 z, and hence the field inside the sphere is (surprisingly) uniform: E = 3 ϵr + 2 E0. (4.49) 17 Remember, P1 (cos θ) = cos θ, and the coefficients must be equal for each l, as you could prove by multiplying by Pl′ (cos θ) sin θ, integrating from 0 to π, and invoking the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials (Eq. 3.68). 195 4.4 Linear Dielectrics x y z d q θ r Fig. 4.31 Example 4.8. Suppose the entire region below the plane z = 0in Fig. 4.31 is filled with uniform linear dielectric material of suscepti- bility χe. Calculate the force on a point charge q situated a distance d above the origin. Solution. The surface bound charge on the xy plane is of opposite sign to q, so the force will be attractive. (In view of Eq. 4.39, there is no volume bound charge.) Let us first calculate σb, using Eqs. 4.11 and 4.30: 18 σb = P · ˆn = Pz = ϵ0χeEz, where Ez is the z-component of the total field just inside the dielectric, at z = 0. This field is due in part to q and in part to the bound charge itself. From Coulomb’s law, the former contribution is − 1 4πϵ0 q (r2 + d2) cos θ = − 1 4πϵ0 qd (r2 + d2)3/2 , where r = √x2 + y2 is the distance from the origin. The z component of the field of the bound charge, meanwhile, is −σb/2ϵ0 (see footnote after Eq. 2.33). Thus σb = ϵ0χe [− 1 4πϵ0 qd (r2 + d2)3/2 − σb 2ϵ0 ], which we can solve for σb: σb = − 1 2π ( χe χe + 2 ) qd (r2 + d2)3/2 . (4.50) Apart from the factor χe/(χe+2), this is exactly the same as the induced charge on an infinite conducting plane under similar circumstances (Eq. 3.10).19 Evidently, the total bound charge is qb = −( χe χe + 2 )q. (4.51) 18 This method mimics Prob. 3.40. 19 For some purposes a conductor can be regarded as the limiting case of a linear dielectric, with χe →∞. This is often a useful check – try applying it to Exs. 4.5, 4.6,and 4.7. 196 4 Electric Fields in Matter We could, of course, obtain the field of σb by direct integration: E = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ( ˆ 2 ) σb da. But, as in the case of the conducting plane, there is a nicer solution by the method of images. If we replace the dielectric by a single point charge qb at the image position (0, 0, −d),wehave V = 1 4πϵ0 [ q √ x2 + y2 + (z − d)2 + qb √ x2 + y2 + (z + d)2 ] (4.52) in the region z > 0. Meanwhile, a charge (q + qb)at (0, 0, d) yields the potential V = 1 4πϵ0 [ q + qb √ x2 + y2 + (z − d)2 ] (4.53) for the region z < 0. Taken together, Eqs. 4.52 and 4.53 constitute a function that satisfies Poisson’s equation with point charge q at (0, 0, d), which goes to zero at infinity, which is continuous at the boundary z = 0, and whose normal derivative exhibits the disconti- nuity appropriate to a surface charge σb at z = 0: −ϵ0 ( ∂V ∂z |||z=0+ − ∂V ∂z |||z=0− ) = − 1 2π ( χe χe + 2 ) qd (x2 + y2 + d2)3/2 . Accordingly, this is the correct potential for our problem. In particular, the force on q is F = 1 4πϵ0 qqb (2d)2 ˆz = − 1 4πϵ0 ( χe χe + 2 ) q 2 4d2 ˆz. (4.54) I do not claim to have provided a compelling motivation for Eqs. 4.52 and 4.53 – like all image solutions, this one owes its justification to the fact that it works: it solves Poisson’s equation, and it meets the boundary conditions. Still, discovering an image solution is not entirely a matter of guesswork. There are at least two “rules of the game.” (1) You must never put an image charge into the region where you’re computing the potential. (Thus Eq. 4.52 gives the potential for z > 0, but this image charge qb is at z = −d; when we turn to the region z < 0(Eq. 4.53), the image charge (q + qb)isat z =+d.) (2) The image charges must add up to the correct total in each region. (That’s how I knew to use qb to account for the charge in the region z ≤ 0, and (q + qb) to cover the region z ≥ 0.) Problem 4.22. A very long cylinder of linear dielectric material is placed in an otherwise uniform electric field E0. Find the resulting field within the cylinder. (The radius is a,the susceptibility χe, and the axis is perpendicular to E0.) Problem 4.23. Find the field inside a sphere of linear dielectric material in an otherwise uniform electric field E0 (Ex. 4.7) by the following method of successive approximations: First 197 4.4 Linear Dielectrics pretend the field inside is just E0,and use Eq. 4.30 to write down the resulting polarization P0. This polarization generates a field of its own, E1 (Ex. 4.2), which in turn modifies the polarization by an amount P1, which further changes the field by an amount E2,and so on. The resulting field is E0 + E1 + E2 + ··· . Sum the series, and compare your answer with Eq. 4.49. Problem 4.24. An uncharged conducting sphere of radius a is coated with a thick insulating shell (dielectric constant ϵr) out to radius b. This object is now placed in an otherwise uniform electric field E0. Find the electric field in the insulator. ! Problem 4.25. Suppose the region above the xy plane in Ex. 4.8 is also filled with linear dielectric but of a different susceptibility χ′ e. Find the potential everywhere. 4.4.3 Energy in Dielectric Systems It takes work to charge up a capacitor (Eq. 2.55): W = 1 2 CV 2. If the capacitor is filled with linear dielectric, its capacitance exceeds the vacuum value by a factor of the dielectric constant, C = ϵrCvac, as we found in Ex. 4.6. Evidently, the work necessary to charge a dielectric- filled capacitor (to a given voltage) is increased by the same factor. The reason is pretty clear: you have to pump on more (free) charge, to achieve a given potential, because part of the field is canceled off by the bound charges. In Chapter 2, I derived a general formula for the energy stored in any electrostatic system (Eq. 2.45): W = ϵ0 2 ∫ E2 dτ. (4.55) The case of the dielectric-filled capacitor suggests that this should be changed to W = ϵ0 2 ∫ ϵrE2 dτ = 1 2 ∫ D · E dτ, in the presence of linear dielectrics. To prove it, suppose the dielectric material is fixed in position, and we bring in the free charge, a bit at a time. As ρf is increased by an amount Δρf , the polarization will change and with it the bound charge distribution; but we’re interested only in the work done on the incremental free charge: ΔW = ∫ (Δρf )Vdτ. (4.56) 198 4 Electric Fields in Matter Since ∇ · D = ρf , Δρf = ∇ · (ΔD),where ΔD is the resulting change in D,so ΔW = ∫ [∇ · (ΔD)]Vdτ. Now ∇ · [(ΔD)V ] = [∇ · (ΔD)]V + ΔD · (∇V ), and hence (integrating by parts), ΔW = ∫ ∇ · [(ΔD)V ] dτ + ∫ (ΔD) · E dτ. The divergence theorem turns the first term into a surface integral, which vanishes if we integrate over all space. Therefore, the work done is equal to ΔW = ∫ (ΔD) · E dτ. (4.57) So far, this applies to any material. Now, if the medium is a linear dielectric, then D = ϵE,so 1 2 Δ(D · E) = 1 2 Δ(ϵE2) = ϵ(ΔE) · E = (ΔD) · E (for infinitesimal increments). Thus ΔW = Δ( 1 2 ∫ D · E dτ). The total work done, then, as we build the free charge up from zero to the final configuration, is W = 1 2 ∫ D · E dτ, (4.58) as anticipated. 20 It may puzzle you that Eq. 4.55, which we derived quite generally in Chapter 2, does not seem to apply in the presence of dielectrics, where it is replaced by Eq. 4.58. The point is not that one or the other of these equa- tions is wrong, but rather that they address somewhat different questions. The distinction is subtle, so let’s go right back to the beginning: What do we mean by “the energy of a system”? Answer: It is the work required to assemble the system. Very well – but when dielectrics are involved, there are two quite different ways one might construe this process: (1) We bring in all the charges (free and bound), one by one, with tweezers, and glue each one down in its proper final location. If this is what you mean by “assemble the system,” then Eq. 4.55 is your formula for the energy stored. Notice, however, that this will not include the work 20 In case you are wondering why I did not do this more simply by the method of Section 2.4.3, starting with W = 1 2 ∫ ρf Vdτ, the reason is that this formula is untrue, in general. Study the derivation of Eq. 2.42, and you will see that it applies only to the total charge. For linear dielectrics it happens to hold for the free charge alone, but this is scarcely obvious a priori and, in fact, is most easily confirmed by working backward from Eq. 4.58. 199 4.4 Linear Dielectrics involved in stretching and twisting the dielectric molecules (if we picture the positive and negative charges as held together by tiny springs, it does not include the spring energy, 1 2 kx 2, associated with polarizing each molecule). 21 (2) With the unpolarized dielectric in place, we bring in the free charges, one by one, allowing the dielectric to respond as it sees fit. If this is what you mean by “assemble the system” (and ordinarily it is, since free charge is what we actually push around), then Eq. 4.58 is the formula you want. In this case the “spring” energy is included, albeit indirectly, because the force you must apply to the free charge depends on the disposition of the bound charge; as you move the free charge, you are automatically stretching those “springs.” Example 4.9. A sphere of radius R is filled with material of dielectric constant ϵr and uniform embedded free charge ρf . What is the energy of this configuration? Solution. From Gauss’s law (in the form of Eq. 4.23), the displace- ment is D(r) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ ρf 3 r (r < R), ρf 3 R3 r2 ˆr (r > R). So the electric field is E(r) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ ρf 3ϵ0ϵr r (r < R), ρf 3ϵ0 R3 r2 ˆr (r > R). The purely electrostatic energy (Eq. 4.55)is W1 = ϵ0 2 [ ( ρf 3ϵ0ϵr ) 2 ∫ R 0 r 24πr 2 dr + ( ρf 3ϵ0 ) 2R6 ∫ ∞ R 1 r4 4πr 2 dr] = 2π 9ϵ0 ρ2 f R5 ( 1 5ϵ2 r + 1). But the total energy (Eq. 4.58)is W2 = 1 2 [( ρf 3 )( ρf 3ϵ0ϵr ) ∫ R 0 r 24πr 2 dr + ( ρf R3 3 )( ρf R3 3ϵ0 ) ∫ ∞ R 1 r4 4πr 2 dr] = 2π 9ϵ0 ρ2 f R5 ( 1 5ϵr + 1). 21 The “spring” itself may be electrical in nature, but it is still not included in Eq. 4.55,if E is takentobethe macroscopic field. See Prob. 4.32. 200 4 Electric Fields in Matter Notice that W1 < W2 – that’s because W1 does not include the energy involved in stretching the molecules. Let’s check that W2 is the work done on the free charge in assem- bling the system. We start with the (uncharged, unpolarized) dielectric sphere, and bring in the free charge in infinitesimal installments (dq), filling out the sphere layer by layer (what I called the “method of assembly” in Prob. 2.36). When we have reached radius r′, the electric field is E(r) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ ρf 3ϵ0ϵr r (r < r′), ρf 3ϵ0ϵr r′3 r2 ˆr (r′ < r < R), ρf 3ϵ0 r′3 r2 ˆr (r > R). The work required to bring the next dq in from infinity to r′ is dW = −dq[∫ R ∞ E · dl + ∫ r′ R E · dl] = −dq[ ρf r′3 3ϵ0 ∫ R ∞ 1 r2 dr + ρf r′3 3ϵ0ϵr ∫ r′ R 1 r2 dr] = ρf r′3 3ϵ0 [ 1 R + 1 ϵr ( 1 r′ − 1 R ) ] dq. This increases the radius (r′): dq = ρf 4πr′2 dr′, so the total work done, in going from r′ = 0to r′ = R,is W = 4πρ2 f 3ϵ0 [ 1 R (1 − 1 ϵr ) ∫ R 0 r′5 dr′ + 1 ϵr ∫ R 0 r′4 dr′] = 2π 9ϵ0 ρ2 f R5 ( 1 5ϵr + 1) = W2. ✓ Evidently, the energy “stored in the springs” is Wspring = W2 − W1 = 2π 45ϵ0ϵ2 r ρ2 f R5(ϵr − 1). It is sometimes alleged that Eq. 4.58 represents the energy even for nonlinear dielectrics, but this is false: to proceed beyond Eq. 4.57, one must assume linearity. In fact, for dissipative systems the whole notion of “stored energy” loses its meaning, because the work done depends not only on the final configuration but on how it got there. If the molecular “springs” are allowed to have some friction, for instance, then Wspring can be made as large as you like, by assembling the charges in such a way that the spring is obliged to expand and contract many times before reaching its final state. In particular, you get nonsensical results if you try to apply Eq. 4.58 to electrets, with frozen-in polarization (see Prob. 4.27). 201 4.4 Linear Dielectrics Problem 4.26. A spherical conductor, of radius a, carries a charge Q (Fig. 4.32). It is sur- rounded by linear dielectric material of susceptibility χe, out to radius b. Find the energy of this configuration (Eq. 4.58). Q a b Fig. 4.32 Problem 4.27. Calculate W , using both Eq. 4.55 and Eq. 4.58, for a sphere of radius R with frozen-in uniform polarization P (Ex. 4.2). Comment on the discrepancy. Which (if either) is the “true”energy of the system? 4.4.4 Forces on Dielectrics Just as a conductor is attracted into an electric field (Eq. 2.51), so too is a dielectric – and for essentially the same reason: the bound charge tends to accumulate near the free charge of the opposite sign. But the calculation of forces on dielectrics can be surprisingly tricky. Consider, for example, the case of a slab of linear dielectric material, partially inserted between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.33). We have always pretended that the field is uniform inside a parallel-plate capacitor, and zero outside. If this were literally true, there would be no net force on the dielectric at all, since the field everywhere would be perpendicular to the plates. However, there is in reality a fringing field around the edges, which for most purposes can be ignored, but in this case is responsible for the whole effect. (Indeed, Dielectric l w d x Fig. 4.33 202 4 Electric Fields in Matter x y E dl = 0 Fringing region . Fig. 4.34 the field could not terminate abruptly at the edge of the capacitor, for if it did, the line integral of E around the closed loop shown in Fig. 4.34 would not be zero.) It is this nonuniform fringing field that pulls the dielectric into the capacitor. Fringing fields are notoriously difficult to calculate; luckily, we can avoid this altogether, by the following ingenious method.22 Let W be the energy of the system – it depends, of course, on the amount of overlap. If I pull the dielectric out an infinitesimal distance dx, the energy is changed by an amount equal to the work done: dW = Fme dx, (4.59) where Fme is the force I must exert, to counteract the electrical force F on the dielectric: Fme = −F. Thus the electrical force on the slab is F = − dW dx . (4.60) Now, the energy stored in the capacitor is W = 1 2 CV 2, (4.61) and the capacitance in this case is C = ϵ0w d (ϵrl − χex), (4.62) where l is the length of the plates (Fig. 4.33). Let’s assume that the total charge on the plates (Q = CV ) is held constant, as the dielectric moves. In terms of Q, W = 1 2 Q 2 C , (4.63) so F = − dW dx = 1 2 Q 2 C2 dC dx = 1 2 V 2 dC dx . (4.64) 22 For a direct calculation from the fringing fields, see E. R. Dietz, Am. J. Phys. 72, 1499 (2004). 203 4.4 Linear Dielectrics But dC dx = − ϵ0χew d , and hence F = − ϵ0χew 2d V 2. (4.65) (The minus sign indicates that the force is in the negative x direction; the dielectric is pulled into the capacitor.) It is an infamous blunder to use Eq. 4.61 (with V constant), rather than Eq. 4.63 (with Q constant), in computing the force. One then obtains F = − 1 2 V 2 dC dx , which is off by a sign. It is, of course, possible to maintain the capacitor at a fixed potential, by connecting it up to a battery. But in that case the battery also does work as the dielectric moves; instead of Eq. 4.59,wenow have dW = Fme dx + VdQ, (4.66) where VdQ is the work done by the battery. It follows that F = − dW dx + V dQ dx = − 1 2 V 2 dC dx + V 2 dC dx = 1 2 V 2 dC dx , (4.67) thesameasbefore(Eq. 4.64), with the correct sign. Please understand: The force on the dielectric cannot possibly depend on whether you plan to hold Q constant or V constant – it is determined entirely by the distribution of charge, free and bound, at the moment in question. It’s simpler to calculate the force assuming constant Q, because then you don’t have to worry about work done by the battery; but if you insist, it can be done correctly either way. Notice that we were able to determine the force without knowing anything about the fringing fields that are ultimately responsible for it! Of course, it’s built into the whole structure of electrostatics that ∇ × E = 0, and hence that the fringing fields must be present; we’re not really getting something for nothing here – just cleverly exploiting the internal consistency of the theory. The energy stored in the fringing fields themselves (which was not accounted for in this derivation) stays constant, as the slab moves; what does change is the energy well inside the capacitor, where the field is nice and uniform. Problem 4.28. Two long coaxial cylindrical metal tubes (inner radius a,outer radius b) stand vertically in a tank of dielectric oil (susceptibility χe, mass density ρ). The inner one is maintained at potential V,and theouter oneisgrounded(Fig. 4.35). To what height (h)does the oil rise, in the space between the tubes? 204 4 Electric Fields in Matter Oil h b a Fig. 4.35 More Problems on Chapter 4 Problem 4.29.

A point charge Q is “nailed down” on a table. Around it, at radius R,isa frictionless circular track on which a dipole p rides, constrained always to point tangent to the circle. Use Eq. 4.5 to show that the electric force on the dipole is F = Q 4πϵ0 p R3 . Notice that this force is always in the “forward”direction (you can easily confirm this by drawing a diagram showing the forces on the two ends of the dipole). Why isn’t this a perpetual motion machine?23 Problem 4.32. As a model for a polarizable atom, consider two point charges ±q connected byaspringofconstant k and equilibrium length zero. That is, the force on +q (with −q nailed down at the origin) would be −kx,where x is their separation. (The “spring”here is a surrogate for whatever holds the molecule together – it includes the electrical attraction of the other end. If it bothers you that the force is taken to be proportional to the separation – not, say, to 1/r2 – look again at Ex. 4.1 or Probs. 4.2 and 4.3; realistic models, with the charges smeared out, lead naturally to a Hooke’s law force, at least for small displacements.) (a) Find the polarizability α,intermsof k and q. (b) Now calculate the energy of an induced dipole p, in an electric field E.[Hint: The work required to bring in the charges and place them in position is still given by Eq. 4.6.But in addition to that we must stretch the spring to its appropriate length.

Question: Could you trap a neutral (but polarizable) atom in an electrostatic field? (a) Show that the force on the atom is F = 1 2 α∇(E2). Note that the dipole is drawn into a region of stronger field. (b) The question becomes, therefore, whether it is possible for E2 to have a local maximum (in a charge-free region). In that case the force would push the atom back to its equilibrium position. Show that the answer is no.[Hint: Use Prob. 3.4a.]24 Problem 4.34. A dielectric cube of side a, centered at the origin, carries a “frozen-in” polar- ization P = kr,where k is a constant. Find all the bound charges, and check that they add up to zero. Problem 4.35. The space between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor is filled with dielec- tric material whose dielectric constant varies linearly from 1 at the bottom plate (x = 0)to 2 at the top plate (x = d). The capacitor is connected to a battery of voltage V. Find all the bound charge, and check that the total is zero. 23 This charming paradox was suggested by K. Brownstein. 24 Interestingly, it can be done with oscillating fields. See Prob. 9.44. 206 4 Electric Fields in Matter Problem 4.36. A point charge q is embedded at the center of a sphere of linear dielectric material (with susceptibility χe and radius R). Find the electric field, the polarization, and the bound charge densities, ρb and σb. What is the total bound charge on the surface? Where is the compensating negative bound charge located? Problem 4.37. At the interface between one linear dielectric and another, the electric field lines bend (see Fig. 4.37). Show that tan θ2/ tan θ1 = ϵ2/ϵ1, (4.68) assuming there is no free charge at the boundary. [Comment: Eq. 4.68 is reminiscent of Snell’s law in optics. Would a convex “lens”of dielectric material tend to “focus,”or “defocus,”the electric field?] 1 2 E1 E2 θ1 θ2 ϵ ϵ Fig. 4.37 ! Problem 4.38.

Prove the following uniqueness theorem: A volume V contains a specified free charge distribution, and various pieces of linear dielectric material, with the susceptibility of each one given. If the potential is specified on the boundaries S of V (V = 0 at infinity would be suitable) then the potential throughout V is uniquely determined.

Check this claim, as follows: (a) Write down the formula for the proposed potential V (r),intermsof V0, R,and r. Use it to determine the field, the polarization, the bound charge, and the free charge distribution on the sphere. (b) Show that the resulting charge configuration would indeed produce the potential V (r). (c) Appeal to the uniqueness theorem in Prob. 4.39 to complete the argument.

According to Eq. 4.5,theforceonasingledipoleis (p · ∇)E,sothe net force on a dielectric object is F = ∫ (P · ∇)Eext dτ. (4.69) [Here Eext is the field of everything except the dielectric. You might assume that it wouldn’t matter if you used the total field; after all, the dielectric can’t exert a force on itself. However, because the field of the dielectric is discontinuous at the location of any bound surface charge, the derivative introduces a spurious delta function, and it is safer to stick with Eext.] Use Eq. 4.69 to determine the force on a tiny sphere, of radius R, composed of linear dielectric material of susceptibility χe, which is situated a distance s from a fine wire carrying a uniform line charge λ. ! Problem 4.42. In a linear dielectric, the polarization is proportional to the field: P = ϵ0χeE. If the material consists of atoms (or nonpolar molecules), the induced dipole moment of each one is likewise proportional to the field p = αE. Question: What is the relation between the atomic polarizability α and the susceptibility χe? Since P (the dipole moment per unit volume) is p (the dipole moment per atom) times N (the number of atoms per unit volume), P = Np = NαE, one’s first inclination is to say that χe = Nα ϵ0 . (4.70) And in fact this is not far off, if the density is low. But closer inspection reveals a subtle problem, for the field E in Eq. 4.30 is the total macroscopic field in the medium, whereas the field in Eq. 4.1 is due to everything except the particular atom under consideration (polarizability was defined for an isolated atom subject to a specified external field); call this field Eelse. Imagine that the space allotted to each atom is a sphere of radius R,and showthat E = (1 − Nα 3ϵ0 )Eelse. (4.71) 208 4 Electric Fields in Matter Usethistoconcludethat χe = Nα/ϵ0 1 − Nα/3ϵ0 , or α = 3ϵ0 N ( ϵr − 1 ϵr + 2 ). (4.72) Equation 4.72 is known as the Clausius–Mossotti formula, or, in its application to optics, the Lorentz–Lorenz equation. Problem 4.43. Check the Clausius–Mossotti relation (Eq. 4.72) for the gases listed in Table 4.1. (Dielectric constants are given in Table 4.2.) (The densities here are so small that Eqs. 4.70 and 4.72 are indistinguishable. For experimental data that confirm the Clausius–Mossotti correction term see, for instance, the first edition of Purcell’s Electricity and Magnetism, Problem 9.28.)25 ! Problem 4.44. The Clausius–Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.42) tells you how to calculate the susceptibility of a nonpolar substance, in terms of the atomic polarizability α.The Langevin equation tells you how to calculate the susceptibility of a polar substance, in terms of the permanent molecular dipole moment p. Here’s how it goes: (a) The energy of a dipole in an external field E is u = −p·E = −pE cos θ (Eq. 4.6), where θ is the usual polar angle, if we orient the z-axis along E. Statistical mechanics says that for a material in equilibrium at absolute temperature T, the probability of a given molecule having energy u is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, exp(−u/kT ). The average energy of the dipoles is therefore ⟨u⟩ = ∫ ue−(u/kT ) dΩ ∫ e−(u/kT ) dΩ , where dΩ = sin θ dθ dφ, and the integration is over all orientations (θ :0 → π; φ :0 → 2π). Use this to show that the polarization of a substance containing N molecules per unit volume is P = Np[coth(pE/kT ) − (kT/pE)]. (4.73) That’s the Langevin formula. Sketch P/Np as a function of pE/kT. (b) Notice that for large fields/low temperatures, virtually all the molecules are lined up, and the material is nonlinear. Ordinarily, however, kT is much greater than pE. Show that in this régime the material is linear, and calculate its susceptibility, in terms of N, p, T, and k. Compute the susceptibility of water at 20◦C, and compare the experimental value in Table 4.2. (The dipole moment of water is 6.1 × 10−30 Cm.) This is rather far off, because we have again neglected the distinction between E and Eelse. The agreement is better in low-density gases, for which the difference between E and Eelse is negligible. Try it for water vapor at 100◦C and 1 atm. 25 E. M. Purcell, Electricity and Magnetism (Berkeley Physics Course, Vol. 2), McGraw-Hill, New York (1963). 5 Magnetostatics 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 5.1.1 Magnetic Fields Remember the basic problem of classical electrodynamics: we have a collection of charges q1, q2, q3, ... (the “source” charges), and we want to calculate the force they exert on some other charge Q (the “test” charge – Fig. 2.1). According to the principle of superposition, it is sufficient to find the force of a single source charge – the total is then the vector sum of all the individual forces. Up to now, we have confined our attention to the simplest case, electrostatics, in which the source charge is at rest (though the test charge need not be). The time has come to consider the forces between charges in motion. To give you some sense of what is in store, imagine that I set up the fol- lowing demonstration: Two wires hang from the ceiling, a few centimeters apart; when I turn on a current, so that it passes up one wire and back down the other, the wires jump apart – they repel one another (Fig. 5.1a). How do we explain this? You might suppose that the battery (or whatever drives the current) is actually charging up the wire, and that the force is simply due to the electrical repulsion of like charges. But this is incorrect. I could hold up a test charge near these wires, and there would be no force on it, 1 for the wires are in fact electrically neutral. (It’s true that electrons are flowing down the line – that’s what a current is – but there are just as many stationary plus charges as moving minus charges on any given segment.) Moreover, if I hook up my demonstration so as to make the current flow up both wires (Fig. 5.1b), they are found to attract! Whatever force accounts for the attraction of parallel currents and the repulsion of antiparallel ones is not electrostatic in nature. It is our first encounter with a magnetic force. Whereas a stationary charge produces only an electric field E in the space around it, a moving charge generates, in addition, a magnetic field B. In fact, magnetic fields are a lot easier to detect, in practice – all you need is a Boy Scout compass. How these devices work is irrelevant at the moment; it is enough to know that the needle points in the direction of the local magnetic field. Ordinarily, this means north,in response to the Earth’s magnetic field, but in the laboratory, where typical 1 This is not precisely true, as we shall see in Prob. 7.45 210 5 Magnetostatics Battery Battery (a) Currents in opposite directions repel. (b) Currents in the same direction attract. \u0002\u0004\u0002\u0004 Fig. 5.1 Current Magnetic field Fig. 5.2 F Wire 1 B v II Wire 2 Fig. 5.3 fields may be hundreds of times stronger than that, the compass indicates the direction of whatever magnetic field is present. Now, if you hold up a tiny compass in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire, you quickly discover a very peculiar thing: the field does not point toward the wire, nor away from it, but rather it circles around the wire.In fact, if you grab the wire with your right hand – thumb in the direction of the current – your fingers curl around in the direction of the magnetic field (Fig. 5.2). How can such a field lead to a force of attraction on a nearby parallel current? At the second wire, the magnetic field points into the page (Fig. 5.3), the current is upward, and yet the resulting force is to the left!It’s going to take a strange law to account for these directions. 211 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 5.1.2 Magnetic Forces In fact, this combination of directions is just right for a cross product: the magnetic force on a charge Q, moving with velocity v in a magnetic field B,is 2 Fmag = Q(v × B). (5.1) This is known as the Lorentz force law. 3 In the presence of both electric and magnetic fields, the net force on Q would be F = Q[E + (v × B)]. (5.2) I do not pretend to have derived Eq. 5.1, of course; it is a fundamental axiom of the theory, whose justification is to be found in experiments such as the one I described in Section 5.1.1. Our main job from now on is to calculate the magnetic field B (and for that matter the electric field E as well; the rules are more complicated when the source charges are in motion). But before we proceed, it is worthwhile to take a closer look at the Lorentz force law itself; it is a peculiar law, and it leads to some truly bizarre particle trajectories. Example 5.1. (Cyclotron motion) The archetypical motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is circular, with the magnetic force providing the centripetal acceleration. In Fig. 5.4, a uniform magnetic field points into the page; if the charge Q moves counterclockwise, with speed v, around a circle of radius R, the magnetic force points inward, and has a fixed magnitude QvB – just right to sustain uniform circular motion: QvB = m v2 R ,or p = QBR, (5.3) where m is the particle’s mass and p = mv is its momentum. Equation 5.3 is known as the cyclotron formula because it describes the motion of a particle in a cyclotron – the first of the modern particle accelerators. It also suggests a simple experimental technique for finding the momentum of a charged particle: send it through a region of known magnetic field, and measure the radius of its trajectory. This is in fact the standard means for determining the momenta of elementary particles. I assumed that the charge moves in a plane perpendicular to B.If it starts out with some additional speed v ∥ parallel to B, this component of the motion is unaffected by the magnetic field, and the particle moves in a helix (Fig. 5.5). The radius is still given by Eq. 5.3,but the velocity in question is now the component perpendicular to B:call it v⊥. 2 Since F and v are vectors, B is actually a pseudovector. 3 Actually, it is due to Oliver Heaviside. 212 5 Magnetostatics y Q R x z v B F Fig. 5.4 v Fig. 5.5 Example 5.2. (Cycloid motion) A more exotic trajectory occurs if we include a uniform electric field, at right angles to the magnetic one. Suppose, for instance, that B points in the x direction, and E in the z direction, as shown in Fig. 5.6. A positive charge is released from the origin; what path will it follow? Solution. Let’s think it through qualitatively, first. Initially, the par- ticle is at rest, so the magnetic force is zero, and the electric field accelerates the charge in the z direction. As it picks up speed, a magnetic force develops which, according to Eq. 5.1, pulls the charge around to the right. The faster it goes, the stronger Fmag becomes; eventually, it curves the particle back around toward the y-axis. At this point the charge is moving against the electrical force, so it begins to slow down – the magnetic force then decreases, and the electrical force takes over, bringing the particle to rest at point a,in Fig. 5.6. There the entire process commences anew, carrying the particle over to point b, and so on. Now let’s do it quantitatively. There being no force in the x direction, the position of the particle at any time t can be described by the vector r(t) = (0, y(t), z(t)); the velocity is therefore v = (0, ˙y, ˙z), where the dots denote time derivatives. Thus v × B = |||||||| ˆx ˆy ˆz 0 ˙y ˙z B 00 |||||||| = B ˙zˆy − B ˙yˆz, z a y x E B 0 b c Fig. 5.6 213 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law and hence, applying Newton’s second law, F = Q(E + v × B) = Q(Eˆz + B ˙zˆy − B ˙yˆz) = ma = m(¨yˆy + ¨zˆz). Or, treating the ˆy and ˆz components separately, QB ˙z = m¨y, QE − QB ˙y = m¨z. For convenience, let ω ≡ QB m . (5.4) (This is the cyclotron frequency, at which the particle would revolve in the absence of any electric field.) Then the equations of motion take the form ¨y = ω ˙z, ¨z = ω ( E B − ˙y). (5.5) Their general solution 4 is y(t) = C1 cos ωt + C2 sin ωt + (E/B)t + C3, z(t) = C2 cos ωt − C1 sin ωt + C4. ⎫⎪⎬ ⎪ ⎭ (5.6) But the particle started from rest ( ˙y(0) = ˙z(0) = 0), at the origin (y(0) = z(0) = 0); these four conditions determine the constants C1, C2, C3,and C4: y(t) = E ωB (ωt − sin ωt), z(t) = E ωB (1 − cos ωt). (5.7) In this form, the answer is not terribly enlightening, 5 but if we let R ≡ E ωB , (5.8) and eliminate the sines and cosines by exploiting the trigonometric identity sin2 ωt + cos2 ωt = 1, we find that (y − Rωt)2 + (z − R)2 = R2. (5.9) This is the formula for a circle, of radius R, whose center (0, Rωt, R) travels in the y direction at a constant speed u = ωR = E B . (5.10) The particle moves as though it were a spot on the rim of a wheel rolling along the y-axis. The curve generated in this way is called a cycloid. Notice that the overall motion is not in the direction of E,as you might expect, but perpendicular to it. 4 As coupled differential equations, they are easily solved by differentiating the first and using the second to eliminate ¨z. 5 Notice that v2 = ˙y2 + ˙z2 = [(2E/B) sin(ωt/2)]2,sothissolution(whichwas basedonthe nonrelativistic form of Newton’s second law) is valid only when 2E ≪ cB, where c is the speed of light. 214 5 Magnetostatics One implication of the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.1) deserves special attention: magnetic forces do no work. For if Q moves an amount dl = v dt, the work done is dWmag = Fmag · dl = Q(v × B) · v dt = 0. (5.11) This follows because (v×B) is perpendicular to v,so (v×B) ·v = 0. Magnetic forces may alter the direction in which a particle moves, but they cannot speed it up or slow it down. The fact that magnetic forces do no work is an elementary and direct consequence of the Lorentz force law, but there are many situations in which it appears so manifestly false that one’s confidence is bound to waver. When a magnetic crane lifts the carcass of a junked car, for instance, something is obviously doing work, and it seems perverse to deny that the magnetic force is responsible. Well, perverse or not, deny it we must, and it can be a very subtle matter to figure out who does deserve the credit in such circumstances. We’ll see a cute example in the next section, but the full story will have to await Chapter 8. Problem 5.1. A particle of charge q enters a region of uniform magnetic field B (pointing into the page). The field deflects the particle a distance d above the original line of flight, as shown in Fig. 5.7. Is the charge positive or negative? In terms of a, d, B,and q, find the momentum of the particle. aq dv Field region Fig. 5.7 Problem 5.2. Find and sketch the trajectory of the particle in Ex. 5.2,ifitstartsatthe origin with velocity (a) v(0) = (E/B)ˆy; (b) v(0) = (E/2B)ˆy; (c) v(0) = (E/B)(ˆy + ˆz). Problem 5.3. In 1897, J. J. Thomson “discovered” the electron by measuring the charge-to- mass ratio of “cathode rays” (actually, streams of electrons, with charge q and mass m)as follows: (a) First he passed the beam through uniform crossed electric and magnetic fields E and B (mutually perpendicular, and both of them perpendicular to the beam), and adjusted the 215 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law electric field until he got zero deflection. What, then, was the speed of the particles (in terms of E and B)? (b) Then he turned off the electric field, and measured the radius of curvature, R, of the beam, as deflected by the magnetic field alone. In terms of E, B,and R, what is the charge-to- mass ratio (q/m) of the particles? 5.1.3 Currents The current in a wire is the charge per unit time passing a given point. By definition, negative charges moving to the left count the same as positive ones to the right. This conveniently reflects the physical fact that almost all phenomena involving moving charges depend on the product of charge and velocity – if you reverse the signs of q and v, you get the same answer, so it doesn’t really matter which you have. (The Lorentz force law is a case in point; the Hall effect (Prob. 5.44) is a notorious exception.) In practice, it is ordinarily the negatively charged electrons that do the moving – in the direction opposite to the electric current. To avoid the petty complications this entails, I shall often pretend it’s the positive charges that move, as in fact everyone assumed they did for a century or so after Benjamin Franklin established his unfortunate convention. 6 Current is measured in coulombs per second, or amperes (A): 1A = 1 C/s. (5.12) A line charge λ traveling down a wire at speed v (Fig. 5.8) constitutes a current I = λv, (5.13) because a segment of length vΔt, carrying charge λvΔt, passes point P in a time interval Δt. Current is actually a vector: I = λv. (5.14) Because the path of the flow is dictated by the shape of the wire, one doesn’t ordinarily bother to display the direction of I explicitly, but when it comes to surface and volume currents we cannot afford to be so casual, and for the sake of notational consistency it is a good idea to acknowledge the λ v\bt v P Fig. 5.8 6 If we called the electron plus and the proton minus, the problem would never arise. In the context of Franklin’s experiments with cat’s fur and glass rods, the choice was completely arbitrary. 216 5 Magnetostatics vectorial character of currents right from the start.7 A neutral wire, of course, contains as many stationary positive charges as mobile negative ones. The former do not contribute to the current – the charge density λ in Eq. 5.13 refers only to the moving charges. In the unusual situation where both types move, I = λ+v+ + λ−v−.8 The magnetic force on a segment of current-carrying wire is Fmag = ∫ (v × B) dq = ∫ (v × B)λ dl = ∫ (I × B) dl. (5.15) Inasmuch as I and dl both point in the same direction, we can just as well write this as Fmag = ∫ I (dl × B). (5.16) Typically, the current is constant (in magnitude) along the wire, and in that case I comes outside the integral: Fmag = I ∫ (dl × B). (5.17) Example 5.3. A rectangular loop of wire, supporting a mass m, hangs vertically with one end in a uniform magnetic field B, which points into the page in the shaded region of Fig. 5.9. For what current I, in the loop, would the magnetic force upward exactly balance the gravitational force downward? Solution. First of all, the current must circulate clockwise, in order for (I × B) in the horizontal segment to point upward. The force is Fmag = IBa, where a is the width of the loop. (The magnetic forces on the two vertical segments cancel.) For Fmag to balance the weight (mg), we must therefore have a I m Fig. 5.9 7 If it bothers you to treat current as a vector, please go to my website and read the note “Is Current a Vector?”: www.reed.edu/physics/faculty/griffiths/VectorCurrent.pdf. 8 In principle there could even be multiple species of charge (some positive and some negative), each with its own density and velocity; in that case I = ∑ i λivi. But ordinarily the simple form (5.14) will suffice. 217 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law I = mg Ba . (5.18) The weight just hangs there, suspended in midair! What happens if we now increase the current? Then the upward magnetic force exceeds the downward force of gravity, and the loop rises, lifting the weight. Somebody’s doing work, and it sure looks as though the magnetic force is responsible. Indeed, one is tempted to write Wmag = Fmagh = IBah, (5.19) where h is the distance the loop rises. But we know that magnetic forces never do work. What’s going on here? Well, when the loop starts to rise, the charges in the wire are no longer moving horizontally – their velocity now acquires an upward component u, the speed of the loop (Fig. 5.10), in addition to the horizontal component w associated with the current (I = λw). The magnetic force, which is always perpendicular to the velocity, no longer points straight up, but tilts back. It is perpendicular to the net displace- ment of the charge (which is in the direction of v), and therefore it does no work on q. It does have a vertical component (qwB); the net vertical forceonall thecharge(λa) in the upper segment of the loop is Fvert = λawB = IBa (5.20) (as before); but now it also has a horizontal component (quB), which opposes the flow of current. Whoever is in charge of maintaining that current, therefore, must now push those charges along, against the backward component of the magnetic force. The total horizontal force on the top segment is Fhoriz = λauB. (5.21) In a time dt, the charges move a (horizontal) distance wdt,sothe work done by this agency (presumably a battery or a generator) is Wbattery = λaB ∫ uw dt = IBah, which is precisely what we naïvely attributed to the magnetic force in Eq. 5.19. Was work done in this process? Absolutely! Who did it? q u v w Fmag qwB quB Fig. 5.10 218 5 Magnetostatics N Fmop Fig. 5.11 The battery! What, then, was the role of the magnetic force? Well, it redirected the horizontal force of the battery into the vertical motion of the loop and the weight. 9 It may help to consider a mechanical analogy. Imagine you’re sliding a trunk up a frictionless ramp, by pushing on it horizontally with a mop (Fig. 5.11). The normal force (N) does no work, because it is perpendicular to the displacement. But it does have a vertical component (which in fact is what lifts the trunk), and a (backward) horizontal component (which you have to overcome by pushing on the mop). Who is doing the work here? You are, obviously – and yet your force (which is purely horizontal) is not (at least, not directly) what lifts the box. The normal force plays the same passive (but crucial) role as the magnetic force in Ex. 5.3: while doing no work itself, it redirects the efforts of the active agent (you, or the battery, as the case may be), from horizontal to vertical. When charge flows over a surface, we describe it by the surface current density, K, defined as follows: Consider a “ribbon” of infinitesimal width dl⊥, running parallel to the flow (Fig. 5.12). If the current in this ribbon is dI, the surface current density is K ≡ dI dl⊥ . (5.22) Fig. 5.12 9 If you like, the vertical component of Fmag does work lifting the weight, but the horizontal component does equal negative work opposing the current. However you look at it, the net work done by the magnetic force is zero. 219 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law Fig. 5.13 In words, K is the current per unit width. In particular, if the (mobile) surface charge density is σ and its velocity is v, then K = σv. (5.23) In general, K will vary from point to point over the surface, reflecting variations in σ and/or v. The magnetic force on the surface current is Fmag = ∫ (v × B)σ da = ∫ (K × B) da. (5.24) Caveat: Just as E suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge,so B is discontinuous at a surface current.In Eq. 5.24, you must be careful to use the average field, just as we did in Section 2.5.3. When the flow of charge is distributed throughout a three-dimensional region, we describe it by the volume current density, J, defined as follows: Consider a “tube” of infinitesimal cross section da⊥, running parallel to the flow (Fig. 5.13). If the current in this tube is dI, the volume current density is J ≡ dI da⊥ . (5.25) In words, J is the current per unit area. If the (mobile) volume charge density is ρ and the velocity is v, then J = ρv. (5.26) The magnetic force on a volume current is therefore Fmag = ∫ (v × B)ρ dτ = ∫ (J × B) dτ. (5.27) Example 5.4. (a) A current I is uniformly distributed over a wire of circular cross section, with radius a (Fig. 5.14). Find the volume current density J. Solution. The area (perpendicular to the flow) is πa 2,so J = I πa2 . This was trivial because the current density was uniform. 220 5 Magnetostatics Fig. 5.14 sdφ ds Fig. 5.15 (b) Suppose the current density in the wire is proportional to the distance from the axis, J = ks (for some constant k). Find the total current in the wire. Solution. Because J varies with s, we must integrate Eq. 5.25.The current through the shaded patch (Fig. 5.15)is Jda⊥,and da⊥ = sdsdφ.So I = ∫ (ks)(sdsdφ) = 2πk ∫ a 0 s 2 ds = 2πka 3 3 . According to Eq. 5.25, the total current crossing a surface S can be written as I = ∫ S Jda⊥ = ∫ S J · da. (5.28) (The dot product serves neatly to pick out the perpendicular component of da.) In particular, the charge per unit time leaving a volume V is ∮ S J · da = ∫ V(∇ · J) dτ. Because charge is conserved, whatever flows out through the surface must come at the expense of what remains inside: ∫ V(∇ · J) dτ = − d dt ∫ V ρ dτ = − ∫ V ( ∂ρ ∂t ) dτ. (The minus sign reflects the fact that an outward flow decreases the charge left in V.) Since this applies to any volume, we conclude that ∇ · J = − ∂ρ ∂t . (5.29) This is the precise mathematical statement of local charge conservation; it is called the continuity equation. For future reference, let me summarize the “dictionary” we have devel- oped for translating equations into the forms appropriate to point, line, surface, and volume currents: n∑ i=1 ()qivi ∼ ∫ line ()I dl ∼ ∫ surface ()K da ∼ ∫ volume ()J dτ. (5.30) 221 5.2 The Biot–Savart Law This correspondence, which is analogous to q ∼ λ dl ∼ σ da ∼ ρ dτ for the various charge distributions, generates Eqs. 5.15, 5.24,and 5.27 from the original Lorentz force law (5.1). Problem 5.4. Suppose that the magnetic field in some region has the form B = kzˆx (where k is a constant). Find the force on a square loop (side length a), lying in the yz plane and centered at the origin, if it carries a current I, flowing counterclockwise, when you look down the x-axis. Problem 5.5. Acurrent I flows down a wire of radius a. (a) If it is uniformly distributed over the surface, what is the surface current density K? (b) If it is distributed in such a way that the volume current density is inversely proportional to the distance from the axis, what is J (s)? Problem 5.6. (a) A phonograph record carries a uniform density of “static electricity”σ. If it rotates at angular velocity ω, what is the surface current density K at a distance r from the center? (b) A uniformly charged solid sphere, of radius R and total charge Q, is centered at the origin and spinning at a constant angular velocity ω about the z-axis. Find the current density J at any point (r, θ, φ) within the sphere. Problem 5.7. For a configuration of charges and currents confined within a volume V, show that ∫ V J dτ = dp/dt, (5.31) where p is the total dipole moment. [Hint: Evaluate ∫ V ∇ · (xJ) dτ.] 5.2 The Biot–Savart Law 5.2.1 Steady Currents Stationary charges produce electric fields that are constant in time; hence the term electrostatics. 10 Steady currents produce magnetic fields that are constant in time; the theory of steady currents is called magnetostatics. 10 Actually, it is not necessary that the charges be stationary, but only that the charge density at each point be constant. For example, the sphere in Prob. 5.6b produces an electrostatic field 1/4πϵ0 (Q/r2)ˆr, even though it is rotating, because ρ does not depend on t. 222 5 Magnetostatics Stationary charges ⇒ constant electric fields: electrostatics. Steady currents ⇒ constant magnetic fields: magnetostatics. By steady current I mean a continuous flow that has been going on forever, without change and without charge piling up anywhere. (Some people call them “stationary currents”; to my ear, that’s an oxymoron.) Formally, electro/magnetostatics is the régime ∂ρ ∂t = 0, ∂J ∂t = 0, (5.32) at all places and all times. Of course, there’s no such thing in practice as a truly steady current, any more than there is a truly stationary charge. In this sense, both electrostatics and magnetostatics describe artificial worlds that exist only in textbooks. However, they represent suitable approximations as long as the actual fluctuations are remote, or gradual – in fact, for most purposes magnetostatics applies very well to household currents, which alternate 120 times a second! Notice, however, that a moving point charge cannot possibly constitute a steady current. If it’s here one instant, it’s gone the next. This may seem like a minor thing to you, but it’s a major headache for me. I developed each topic in electrostatics by starting out with the simple case of a point charge at rest; then I generalized to an arbitrary charge distribution by invoking the superposition principle. This approach is not open to us in magnetostatics because a moving point charge does not produce a static field in the first place. We are forced to deal with extended current distributions right from the start, and, as a result, the arguments are bound to be more cumbersome. When a steady current flows in a wire, its magnitude I must be the same all along the line; otherwise, charge would be piling up somewhere, and it wouldn’t be a steady current. More generally, since ∂ρ/∂t = 0in magnetostatics, the continuity equation (5.29) becomes ∇ · J = 0. (5.33) 5.2.2 The Magnetic Field of a Steady Current The magnetic field of a steady line current is given by the Biot–Savart law: B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ I × ˆ 2 dl′ = μ0 4π I ∫ dl′ × ˆ 2 . (5.34) The integration is along the current path, in the direction of the flow; dl′ is an element of length along the wire, and , as always, is the vector from the 223 5.2 The Biot–Savart Law Fig. 5.16 source to the point r (Fig. 5.16). The constant μ0 is called the permeability of free space: 11 μ0 = 4π × 10 −7 N/A 2. (5.35) These units are such that B itself comes out in newtons per ampere-meter (as required by the Lorentz force law), or teslas (T): 12 1T = 1N/(A · m). (5.36) As the starting point for magnetostatics, the Biot–Savart law plays a role analogous to Coulomb’s law in electrostatics. Compare Eq. 5.34 with Eq. 2.6;the 1/ 2 dependence is common to both. Like Coulomb’s, the Biot–Savart law is empirical: it comes from experiment. The cross product, which might at first seem strange, is just right to account for the observed directions in Fig. 5.2. Example 5.5. Find the magnetic field a distance s from a long straight wire carrying a steady current I (Fig. 5.17). Solution. In the diagram, (dl′ × ˆ) points out of the page, and has the magnitude dl′ sin α = dl′ cos θ. Also, l′ = s tan θ,so dl′ = s cos2 θ dθ, and s = cos θ,so 1 2 = cos2 θ s2 . Thus B = μ0I 4π ∫ θ2 θ1 ( cos2 θ s2 )( s cos2 θ ) cos θ dθ = μ0I 4πs ∫ θ2 θ1 cos θ dθ = μ0I 4πs (sin θ2 − sin θ1). (5.37) 11 This is an exact number, not an empirical constant. It serves (via Eq. 5.40) to define the ampere, and the ampere in turn defines the coulomb. 12 For some reason, in this one case the cgs unit (the gauss) is more commonly used than the SI unit: 1 tesla = 104 gauss. The Earth’s magnetic field is about half a gauss; a fairly strong laboratory magnetic field is, say, 1 T (10,000 gauss). 224 5 Magnetostatics θ α Fig. 5.17 θ θ Fig. 5.18 Equation 5.37 gives the field of any straight segment of wire, in terms of the initial and final angles θ1 and θ2 (Fig. 5.18). Of course, a finite segment by itself could never support a steady current (where would the charge go when it got to the end?), but it might be a piece of some closed circuit, and Eq. 5.37 would then represent its contribution to the total field. In the case of an infinite wire, θ1 = −π/2 and θ2 = π/2, so we obtain B = μ0I 2πs . (5.38) Notice that the field is inversely proportional to the distance from the wire – just like the electric field of an infinite line charge. In the region below the wire, B points into the page, and in general, it “circles around” the wire, in accordance with the right-hand rule (Fig. 5.2): B = μ0I 2πs ˆφ. (5.39) As an application, let’s find the force of attraction between two long, parallel wires a distance d apart, carrying currents I1 and I2 (Fig. 5.19). The field at (2) due to (1) is B = μ0I1 2πd , and it points into the page. The Lorentz force law (in the form appropriate to line currents, Eq. 5.17) predicts a force directed toward (1), of magnitude F = I2 ( μ0I1 2πd ) ∫ dl. I1 I2 d (1) (2) Fig. 5.19 225 5.2 The Biot–Savart Law The total force, not surprisingly, is infinite, but the force per unit length is f = μ0 2π I1I2 d . (5.40) If the currents are antiparallel (one up, one down), the force is repulsive – consistent again with the qualitative observations in Section 5.1.1. Example 5.6. Find the magnetic field a distance z above the center of a circular loop of radius R, which carries a steady current I (Fig. 5.20). θ θ Fig. 5.20 Solution. The field dB attributable to the segment dl′ points as shown. As we integrate dl′ around the loop, dB sweeps out a cone. The horizontal components cancel, and the vertical components combine, to give B(z) = μ0 4π I ∫ dl′ 2 cos θ. (Notice that dl′ and are perpendicular, in this case; the factor of cos θ projects out the vertical component.) Now, cos θ and 2 are constants, and ∫ dl′ is simply the circumference, 2πR,so B(z) = μ0I 4π ( cos θ 2 )2πR = μ0I 2 R2 (R2 + z2)3/2 . (5.41) For surface and volume currents, the Biot–Savart law becomes B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ K(r′) × ˆ 2 da′ and B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′) × ˆ 2 dτ′, (5.42) respectively. You might be tempted to write down the corresponding for- mula for a moving point charge, using the “dictionary” (Eq. 5.30): B(r) = μ0 4π qv × ˆ 2 , (5.43) 226 5 Magnetostatics but this is simply wrong. 13 As I mentioned earlier, a point charge does not constitute a steady current, and the Biot–Savart law, which only holds for steady currents, does not correctly determine its field. The superposition principle applies to magnetic fields just as it does to electric fields: if you have a collection of source currents, the net field is the (vector) sum of the fields due to each of them taken separately. Problem 5.8. (a) Find the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, which carries a steady current I.Let R be the distance from center to side (Fig. 5.21). (b) Find the field at the center of a regular n-sided polygon, carrying a steady current I.Again, let R be the distance from the center to any side. (c) Check that your formula reduces to the field at the center of a circular loop, in the limit n →∞. Problem 5.9. Find the magnetic field at point P for each of the steady current configurations shown in Fig. 5.22. R I I Fig. 5.21 I I I I I P P Rb a (a) (b) Fig. 5.22 Problem 5.10. (a) Find the force on a square loop placed as shown in Fig. 5.23a, near an infinite straight wire. Both the loop and the wire carry a steady current I. (b) Find the force on the triangular loop in Fig. 5.23b. I I I (a) s a a I (b) s aa a Fig. 5.23 13 I say this loud and clear to emphasize the point of principle; actually, Eq. 5.43 is approxi- mately right for nonrelativistic charges (v ≪ c), under conditions where retardation can be neglected (see Ex. 10.4). 227 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B Problem 5.11. Find the magnetic field at point P on the axis of a tightly wound solenoid (helical coil) consisting of n turns per unit length wrapped around a cylindrical tube of radius a and carrying current I (Fig. 5.24). Express your answer in terms of θ1 and θ2 (it’s tidiest that way). Consider the turns to be essentially circular, and use the result of Ex. 5.6. What is the field on theaxisofan infinite solenoid (infinite in both directions)? θ2 θ1 P a Fig. 5.24 Problem 5.12. Use the result of Ex. 5.6 to calculate the magnetic field at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell, of radius R and total charge Q, spinning at constant angular velocity ω. Problem 5.13. Suppose you have two infinite straight-line charges λ, a distance d apart, moving along at a constant speed v (Fig. 5.25). How great would v have to be in order for the magnetic attraction to balance the electrical repulsion? Work out the actual number. Is this a reasonable sort of speed?14 d v v λ λ Fig. 5.25 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 5.3.1 Straight-Line Currents The magnetic field of an infinite straight wire is shown in Fig. 5.26 (the current is coming out of the page). At a glance, it is clear that this field has a nonzero curl (something you’ll never see in an electrostatic field); let’s calculate it. According to Eq. 5.38, the integral of B around a circular path of radius s, centered at the wire, is ∮ B · dl = ∮ μ0I 2πs dl = μ0I 2πs ∮ dl = μ0I. 14 If you’ve studied special relativity, you may be tempted to look for complexities in this problem that are not really there – λ and v are both measured in the laboratory frame,and this is ordinary electrostatics. 228 5 Magnetostatics B Fig. 5.26 Wire Loop φ2 φ1 Fig. 5.27 I5 I1 I2 I3 I 4 Fig. 5.28 Notice that the answer is independent of s; that’s because Bdecreases at the same rate as the circumference increases. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a circle; any old loop that encloses the wire would give the same answer. For if we use cylindrical coordinates (s, φ, z), with the current flowing along the z-axis, B = (μ0I/2πs) ˆφ and dl = ds ˆs + sdφ ˆφ + dz ˆz,so ∮ B · dl = μ0I 2π ∮ 1 s sdφ = μ0I 2π ∫ 2π 0 dφ = μ0I. This assumes the loop encircles the wire exactly once; if it went around twice, then φ would run from 0 to 4π, and if it didn’t enclose the wire at all, then φ would go from φ1 to φ2 and back again, with ∫ dφ = 0(Fig. 5.27). Now suppose we have a bundle of straight wires. Each wire that passes through our loop contributes μ0I, and those outside contribute nothing (Fig. 5.28). The line integral will then be ∮ B · dl = μ0Ienc, (5.44) where Ienc stands for the total current enclosed by the integration path. If the flow of charge is represented by a volume current density J, the enclosed current is Ienc = ∫ J · da, (5.45) with the integral taken over any surface bounded by the loop. Applying Stokes’ theorem to Eq. 5.44, then, ∫ (∇ × B) · da = μ0 ∫ J · da, 229 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B and hence (since this must hold for any loop) ∇ × B = μ0J. (5.46) With minimal labor, we have actually obtained the general formula for the curl of B. But our derivation is seriously flawed by the restriction to infinite straight-line currents (and combinations thereof). Most current configurations cannot be constructed out of infinite straight wires, and we have no right to assume that Eq. 5.46 applies to them. So the next section is devoted to a formal derivation of the divergence and curl of B, starting from the Biot–Savart law itself. 5.3.2 The Divergence and Curl of B The Biot–Savart law for the general case of a volume current reads B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′) × ˆ 2 dτ′. (5.47) This formula gives the magnetic field at a point r = (x, y, z) in terms of an integral over the current distribution J(x′, y′, z′) (Fig. 5.29). It is best to be absolutely explicit at this stage: B is a function of (x, y, z), J is a function of (x′, y′, z′), = (x − x′)ˆx + (y − y′)ˆy + (z − z′)ˆz, dτ′ = dx′ dy′ dz′. The integration is over the primed coordinates; the divergence and the curl of B are with respect to the unprimed coordinates. Applying the divergence to Eq. 5.47, we obtain ∇ · B = μ0 4π ∫ ∇ · (J × ˆ 2 ) dτ′. (5.48) Invoking product rule number 6, ∇ · (J × ˆ 2 ) = ˆ 2 · (∇ × J) − J · (∇ × ˆ 2 ). (5.49) (x,y,z) (x ,y ,z ) τ Fig. 5.29 230 5 Magnetostatics But ∇ × J = 0, because J doesn’t depend on the unprimed variables, while ∇ × (ˆ/ 2) = 0 (Prob. 1.63b), so ∇ · B = 0. (5.50) Evidently, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. Applying the curl to Eq. 5.47, we obtain ∇ × B = μ0 4π ∫ ∇ × (J × ˆ 2 ) dτ′. (5.51) Again, our strategy is to expand the integrand, using the appropriate product rule – in this case number 8: ∇ × (J × ˆ 2 ) = J(∇ · ˆ 2 ) − (J · ∇) ˆ 2 . (5.52) (I have dropped terms involving derivatives of J, because J does not depend on x, y, z.) The second term on the right integrates to zero, as we’ll see in the next paragraph. The first term involves the divergence we were at pains to calculate in Chapter 1 (Eq. 1.100): ∇ · ( ˆ 2 ) = 4πδ3( ). (5.53) Thus ∇ × B = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′)4πδ3(r − r′) dτ′ = μ0J(r), which confirms that Eq. 5.46 is not restricted to straight-line currents, but holds quite generally in magnetostatics. To complete the argument, however, we must check that the second term in Eq. 5.52 integrates to zero. Because the derivative acts only on ˆ/ 2,we can switch from ∇ to ∇′ at the cost of a minus sign: 15 − (J · ∇) ˆ 2 = (J · ∇′) ˆ 2 . (5.54) The x component, in particular, is (J · ∇′) ( x − x′ 3 ) = ∇′ · [ (x − x′) 3 J] − ( x − x′ 3 ) (∇′ · J) (using product rule 5). Now, for steady currents the divergence of J is zero (Eq. 5.33), so [−(J · ∇) 2 ] x = ∇′ · [ (x − x′) 3 J], and therefore this contribution to the integral (Eq. 5.51) can be written ∫ V ∇′ · [ (x − x′) 3 J] dτ′ = ∮ S (x − x′) 3 J · da′. (5.55) (The reason for switching from ∇ to ∇′ was to permit this use of the divergence theorem.) But what region are we integrating over? Well, it’s the 15 The point here is that depends only on the difference between the coordinates; note that (∂/∂x)f (x − x′) = −(∂/∂x′)f (x − x′). 231 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B volume that appears in the Biot–Savart law (Eq. 5.47) – large enough, that is, to include all the current. You can make it bigger than that, if you like; J = 0 out there anyway, so it will add nothing to the integral. The essential point is that on the boundary the current is zero (all current is safely inside) and hence the surface integral (Eq. 5.55) vanishes.16 5.3.3 Ampère’s Law The equation for the curl of B, ∇ × B = μ0J, (5.56) is called Ampère’s law (in differential form). It can be converted to integral form by the usual device of applying one of the fundamental theorems – in this case Stokes’ theorem: ∫ (∇ × B) · da = ∮ B · dl = μ0 ∫ J · da. Now, ∫ J · da is the total current passing through the surface (Fig. 5.30), which we call Ienc (the current enclosed by the Ampèrian loop). Thus ∮ B · dl = μ0Ienc. (5.57) This is the integral version of Ampère’s law; it generalizes Eq. 5.44 to arbitrary steady currents. Notice that Eq. 5.57 inherits the sign ambiguity of Stokes’ theorem (Section 1.3.5): Which way around the loop am I supposed to go? And which direction through the surface corresponds to a “positive” current? The resolution, as always, is the right-hand rule: if the fingers of your right hand indicate the direction of integration around the boundary, then your thumb defines the direction of a positive current. Just as the Biot–Savart law plays a role in magnetostatics that Coulomb’s law assumed in electrostatics, so Ampère’s plays the part of Gauss’s: ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ electrostatics : Coulomb → Gauss, magnetostatics : Biot–Savart → Ampère. Surface Boundary line J Fig. 5.30 16 If J itself extends to infinity (as in the case of an infinite straight wire), the surface integral is still typically zero, though the analysis calls for greater care. 232 5 Magnetostatics In particular, for currents with appropriate symmetry, Ampère’s law in integral form offers a lovely and extraordinarily efficient way of calculating the magnetic field. Example 5.7. Find the magnetic field a distance s from a long straight wire (Fig. 5.31), carrying a steady current I (the same problem we solved in Ex. 5.5, using the Biot–Savart law). Solution. We know the direction of B is “circumferential,” circling around the wire as indicated by the right-hand rule. By symmetry, the magnitude of B is constant around an Ampèrian loop of radius s, centered on the wire. So Ampère’s law gives ∮ B · dl = B ∮ dl = B2πs = μ0Ienc = μ0I, or B = μ0I 2πs . This is the same answer we got before (Eq. 5.38), but it was obtained this time with far less effort. Example 5.8. Find the magnetic field of an infinite uniform surface current K = K ˆx, flowing over the xy plane (Fig. 5.32). Solution. First of all, what is the direction of B? Could it have any x component? No: A glance at the Biot–Savart law (Eq. 5.42)reveals that B is perpendicular to K. Could it have a z component? No again. You could confirm this by noting that any vertical contribution from a filament at +y is canceled by the corresponding filament at −y.But there is a nicer argument: Suppose the field pointed away from the plane. By reversing the direction of the current, I could make it point toward the plane (in the Biot–Savart law, changing the sign of the current switches the sign of the field). But the z component of B cannot possibly depend on the direction of the current in the xy plane. (Think about it!) So B can only have a y component, and a quick check with your right hand should convince you that it points to the left above the plane and to the right below it. s B I Ampèrian loop Fig. 5.31 Sheet of current Ampèrian loop z y x l K Fig. 5.32 233 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B With this in mind, we draw a rectangular Ampèrian loop as shown in Fig. 5.32, parallel to the yz plane and extending an equal distance above and below the surface. Applying Ampère’s law, ∮ B · dl = 2Bl = μ0Ienc = μ0Kl, (one Bl comes from the top segment and the other from the bottom), so B = (μ0/2)K, or, more precisely, B = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ +(μ0/2)Kˆy for z < 0, −(μ0/2)Kˆy for z > 0. (5.58) Notice that the field is independent of the distance from the plane, just like the electric field of a uniform surface charge (Ex. 2.5). Example 5.9. Find the magnetic field of a very long solenoid, consist- ing of n closely wound turns per unit length on a cylinder of radius R, each carrying a steady current I (Fig. 5.33). [The point of making the windings so close is that one can then pretend each turn is circular. If this troubles you (after all, there is a net current I in the direction of the solenoid’s axis, no matter how tight the winding), picture instead a sheet of aluminum foil wrapped around the cylinder, carrying the equivalent uniform surface current K = nI (Fig. 5.34). Or make a double winding, going up to one end and then – always in the same sense – going back down again, thereby eliminating the net longitudi- nal current. But, in truth, this is all unnecessary fastidiousness, for the field inside a solenoid is huge (relatively speaking), and the field of the longitudinal current is at most a tiny refinement.] Solution. First of all, what is the direction of B? Could it have a radial component? No. For suppose Bs were positive; if we reversed the direction of the current, Bs would then be negative. But switching I is physically equivalent to turning the solenoid upside down, and that certainly should not alter the radial field. How about a “circumferen- tial” (azimuthal) component? No.For Bφ would be constant around an Ampèrian loop concentric with the solenoid (Fig. 5.35), and hence ∮ B · dl = Bφ (2πs) = μ0Ienc = 0, since the loop encloses no current. R I I Fig. 5.33 K Fig. 5.34 234 5 Magnetostatics s Ampèrian loop Fig. 5.35 Ampèrian loops L b a 2 1 Fig. 5.36 So the magnetic field of an infinite, closely wound solenoid runs parallel to the axis. From the right-hand rule, we expect that it points upward inside the solenoid and downward outside. Moreover, it cer- tainly approaches zero as you go very far away. With this in mind, let’s apply Ampère’s law to the two rectangular loops in Fig. 5.36. Loop 1 lies entirely outside the solenoid, with its sides at distances a and b from the axis: ∮ B · dl = [B(a) − B(b)]L = μ0Ienc = 0, so B(a) = B(b). Evidently, the field outside does not depend on the distance from the axis. But we agreed that it goes to zero for large s. It must therefore be zero everywhere! (This astonishing result can also be obtained directly from the Biot–Savart law, of course, but it’s much more difficult. See Prob. 5.49.) As for loop 2, which is half inside and half outside, Ampère’s law gives ∮ B · dl = BL = μ0Ienc = μ0nIL, where B is the field inside the solenoid. (The right-hand side of the loop contributes nothing, since B = 0 out there.) Conclusion: B = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ μ0nIˆz inside the solenoid, 0 outside the solenoid. (5.59) Notice that the field inside is uniform – it doesn’t depend on the distance from the axis. In this sense the solenoid is to magnetostatics what the parallel-plate capacitor is to electrostatics: a simple device for producing strong uniform fields. Like Gauss’s law, Ampère’s law is always true (for steady currents), but it is not always useful. Only when the symmetry of the problem enables you to pull B outside the integral ∮ B · dl can you calculate the magnetic field from Ampère’s law. When it does work, it’s by far the fastest method; 235 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B when it doesn’t, you have to fall back on the Biot–Savart law. The current configurations that can be handled by Ampère’s law are: (1) infinite straight lines (prototype: Ex. 5.7), (2) infinite planes (prototype: Ex. 5.8), (3) infinite solenoids (prototype: Ex. 5.9), (4) toroids (prototype: Ex. 5.10). The last of these is a surprising and elegant application of Ampère’s law. As in Exs. 5.8 and 5.9, the hard part is figuring out the direction of the field (which we will now have done, once and for all, for each of the four geometries); the actual application of Ampère’s law takes only one line. Example 5.10. A toroidal coil consists of a circular ring, or “donut,” around which a long wire is wrapped (Fig. 5.37). The winding is uniform and tight enough so that each turn can be considered a plane closed loop. The cross-sectional shape of the coil is immaterial. I made it rectangular in Fig. 5.37 for the sake of simplicity, but it could just as well be circular or even some weird asymmetrical form, as in Fig. 5.38, as long as the shape remains the same all the way around the ring. In that case, the magnetic field of the toroid is circumferential at all points, both inside and outside the coil. Proof. According to the Biot–Savart law, the field at r due to the current element at r′ is dB = μ0 4π I × 3 dl′. We may as well put r in the xz plane (Fig. 5.38), so its Cartesian components are (x,0, z), while the source coordinates are r′ = (s′ cos φ′, s′ sin φ′, z′). Then = (x − s′ cos φ′, −s′ sin φ′, z − z′). Since the current has no φ component, I = Isˆs + Izˆz,or(in Cartesian coordinates) I = (Is cos φ′, Is sin φ′, Iz). Fig. 5.37 236 5 Magnetostatics φ φ Fig. 5.38 Accordingly, I × = ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ˆx ˆy ˆz Is cos φ′ Is sin φ′ Iz (x − s′ cos φ′)(−s′ sin φ′)(z − z′) ⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ = [sin φ′(Is(z − z′) + s′Iz)]ˆx + [Iz(x − s′ cos φ′) − Is cos φ′(z − z′)]ˆy + [−Isx sin φ′]ˆz. But there is a symmetrically located current element at r′′, with the same s′, the same , the same dl′, the same Is, and the same Iz, but negative φ′ (Fig. 5.38). Because sin φ′ changes sign, the ˆx and ˆz contributions from r′ and r′′ cancel, leaving only a ˆy term. Thus the field at r is in the ˆy direction, and in general the field points in the ˆφ direction. □ Now that we know the field is circumferential, determining its magnitude is ridiculously easy. Just apply Ampère’s law to a circle of radius s about the axis of the toroid: B2πs = μ0Ienc, and hence B(r) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ μ0NI 2πs ˆφ for points inside the coil, 0 for points outside the coil, (5.60) where N is the total number of turns. 237 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B Problem 5.14. Asteadycurrent I flows down a long cylindrical wire of radius a (Fig. 5.39). Find the magnetic field, both inside and outside the wire if: (a) the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the wire; (b) the currentisdistributedinsuchawaythat J is proportional to s, the distance from the axis.

A charged particle moving in the xz plane above the current sheet (where the field is uniform) executes cyclotron motion. But what if its trajectory crosses the xy plane? Describe the resulting motion, and calculate the average (“drift”) velocity.17 Problem 5.17. Two long coaxial solenoids each carry current I, but in opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 5.41. The inner solenoid (radius a)has n1 turns per unit length, and the outer one (radius b)has n2.Find B in each of the following three regions: (i) inside the inner solenoid, (ii) between them, and (iii) outside both.

D 70, 198 (2016). 18 See footnote to Prob. 5.13. 238 5 Magnetostatics ! Problem 5.19. Show that the magnetic field of an infinite solenoid runs parallel to the axis, regardless of the cross-sectional shape of the coil, as long as that shape is constant along the length of the solenoid. What is the magnitude of the field, inside and outside such a coil? Show that the toroid field (Eq. 5.60) reduces to the solenoid field, when the (large) radius of the donut is so much greater than the small radius that a segment can be considered essentially straight. Problem 5.20. In calculating the current enclosed by an Ampèrian loop, one must, in general, evaluate an integral of the form Ienc = ∫ S J · da. Trouble is, there are infinitely many surfaces that share the same boundary line. Which one are we supposed to use? 5.3.4 Comparison of Magnetostatics and Electrostatics The divergence and curl of the electrostatic field are ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ∇ · E = ρ/ϵ0 (Gauss’s law), ∇ × E = 0 (no name). These are Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics. Together with the bound- ary condition E → 0 far from all charges,19 Maxwell’s equations determine the field, if the source charge density ρ is given; they contain essentially the same information as Coulomb’s law plus the principle of superposition. The divergence and curl of the magnetostatic field are ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ∇ · B = 0 (no name), ∇ × B = μ0J (Ampère’s law). These are Maxwell’s equations for magnetostatics. Again, together with the boundary condition B → 0 far from all currents (or symmetry considerations), Maxwell’s equations determine the magnetic field; they are equivalent to the Biot–Savart law (plus superposition). Maxwell’s equations and the force law F = Q(E + v × B) constitute the most elegant formulation of electrostatics and magnetostatics. Intrinsically, electric forces are enormously stronger than magnetic ones. That’s not something obvious from the structure of the theory; it has to do with the sizes of the constants ϵ0 and μ0, and the relatively modest particle speeds typically involved. In general, it is only when both the source charges and the test charge are moving at velocities comparable to the speed 19 In those artificial problems where the charge (or current) extends to infinity – infinite planes, for example – symmetry considerations can sometimes take the place of boundary conditions. 239 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B (a) E (b) B Fig. 5.43 of light that the magnetic force approaches the electric force in strength. (Problems 5.13 and 5.18 illustrate this rule.) How is it, then, that we notice magnetic effects at all? The answer is that both in the production of a magnetic field (Biot–Savart) and in its detection (Lorentz), it is the current that matters, and we can compensate for a smallish velocity by pouring prodigious amounts of charge down the wire. Ordinarily, this charge would simultaneously generate so large an electric force as to swamp the magnetic one. But if we arrange to keep the wire neutral, by embedding in it an equal quantity of opposite charge at rest, the electric field cancels out, leaving the magnetic force to stand alone. It sounds very elaborate, but of course this is precisely what happens in an ordinary current-carrying wire (Prob. 5.21). The electric field diverges away from a (positive) charge; the magnetic field curls around a current (Fig. 5.43). There are no stationary point sources for B – no magnetic analogs to electric charge. This is the physical content of the statement ∇ · B = 0. Coulomb and others believed that magnetism is produced by magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles, as we would now call them), and in some older books you will still find references to a magnetic version of Coulomb’s law, giving the force of attraction or repulsion between “north” and “south” poles. It was Ampère who first speculated that all magnetic effects are attributable to electric charges in motion (currents). As far as we know, Ampère was right, though people still search for magnetic monopoles (they are obviously pretty rare, or somebody would have found one by now 20), and some recent elementary particle theories actually require their existence. In classical electrodynamics, however, B is divergenceless, and there are no magnetic monopoles. It takes (moving) electric charges to produce a magnetic field, and it takes a moving electric charge to “feel” a magnetic field. In electrostatics we found it illuminating to connect up the field vectors to form field lines; the tangent to the field line points in the direction of the 20 An apparent detection (B. Cabrera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1378 (1982)) has never been reproduced – and not for want of trying. For a delightful brief history of ideas about magnetism, read Chap. 1 in D. C. Mattis, The Theory of Magnetism, Harper & Row, New York (1965). 240 5 Magnetostatics (a) (b) BE Fig. 5.44 B a1 a2 Fig. 5.45 field, and the density of field lines (the number per unit cross-sectional area) is proportional to the magnitude of the field. The same device helps us to visualize magnetic fields; thus the fields in Fig. 5.43 become the field lines in Fig. 5.44. Electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative ones (either that, or they extend out to infinity). Magnetic field lines do not begin or end anywhere. In the examples we have encountered they form closed loops (or extend to infinity). The direction of the field line still tells you the direction of the field … but is the density of magnetic field lines proportional to |B|? Yes it is – or rather, we can always choose to make it so. Proof. Imagine a flux tube – a bundle of field lines, sliced off perpendicularly at the two ends (Fig. 5.45). The tube is skinny enough that the field is essentially constant over each end. The surface integral of B over this tube is ∮ S B · da = B2a2 − B1a1 = ∫ V ∇ · B dτ = 0. Thus the flux of B is constant along a given flux tube. If at the “start” (end 1) we have drawn a number of field lines proportional to the flux (n = κB1a1,or B1 = n/(κa1)) then B is proportional to the number of field lines per unit area all along the tube. Doing the same for every flux tube (with the same proportionality factor κ), the density of field lines represents the strength of the field everywhere. □ But there’s a dirty little secret about magnetic field lines that you’re not supposed to talk about in public. In many simple problems (the infinite wire, the circular current ring, the solenoid, the toroidal coil, …) the field lines form closed loops. Indeed, you will often read that magnetic fields always form closed loops. Unfortunately, this is the exception, not the rule, and it depends in each case on a special symmetry of the source. Consider, for 241 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B I B z (a) I’ B (b) Fig. 5.46 B Fig. 5.47 instance, a circular ring carrying a steady current I: the field lines form closed oval-shaped loops that circle the wire (Fig. 5.46a). But suppose we now introduce a long straight wire along the z-axis, with an adjustable current I ′. This will generate an azimuthal field (Fig. 5.46b) that, combined with the field of the ring, yields a pattern of helical field lines that wind around the ring like a slinky (Fig. 5.47). Except for certain very special values of the currents, the “helix” will not close on itself after circling the ring. Indeed, it will wind around and around the ring, weaving a donut-shaped sheath – all from a single field line (see Prob. 5.68). So much for the notion that the density of field lines represents the magnitude of the field! And this is not an unusual case; it’s the typical behavior of magnetic field lines. 21 What’s gone wrong, and can it be fixed? Let’s go back to the flux tube in Fig. 5.45. We start with a bunch of points on the “entering” patch a1, construct the field lines that issue from them, and track those lines out to a2. These are the field lines inside the flux tube … but if we continue to follow one of those lines out past a2, it wanders around (outside the tube) and eventually, perhaps, finds itself back at a1. If it happens to hit one of our starting points, great: it won’t change the total number. But what if it lands between the dots? When it enters the flux tube we will suddenly have too many field lines to represent the strength of the field. What is to be done? Either we abandon the idea that the density of field lines represents the magnitude of the field (in which case we sacrifice the main point of the field-line picture) or else we must stop the errant line at the gate, and identify its continuation as one of the lines we already drew. As long as just as many field lines exit a1 as entered it, that won’t violate ∇ · B = 0…but they are discontinuous at the 21 See J. Slepian, Am.J.Phys. 19, 87 (1951); M. Lieberherr, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1117 (2010); L. Zilberti, IEEE Magn. Lett. 8, 1306005 (2017). See also Prob. 5.67. 242 5 Magnetostatics boundary – they lose their identity, and hop over to an existing field line. (The field line in Fig. 5.47 makes one circuit of the loop, and then jumps over to rejoin its tail.) This complication vitiates the utility of field lines for any but the very simplest examples (which is why we don’t like to talk about it). I guess the moral of the story is not to take magnetic22 field lines too literally. They work within finite neighborhoods, but not globally. Faraday, who introduced the concept, thought of field lines as real physical entities – invisible wires (or spider webs) that exist out there in space (to this day that is how most electrical engineers think of them). If you really want to sustain this picture, you’re going to have to live with magnetic field lines that are discontinuous at places that are entirely arbitrary. I prefer to say that field lines are not physically real; they can sometimes be useful as visual aids, but don’t trust them with serious money. At any rate, in Maxwell’s formulation, field lines play no role: the “real” physical quantities are the fields – vectors at each point – and field lines are nothing but cartoons. Problem 5.21. (a) Find the density ρ of mobile charges in a piece of copper, assuming each atom contributes one free electron. [Look up the necessary physical constants.] (b) Calculate the average electron velocity in a copper wire 1 mm in diameter, carrying a current of 1 A. [Note: This is literally a snail’s pace. How, then, can you carry on a long distance telephone conversation?] (c) What is the force of attraction between two such wires, 1 cm apart? (d) If you could somehow remove the stationary positive charges, what would the electrical repulsion force be? How many times greater than the magnetic force is it? Problem 5.22. Is Ampère’s law consistent with the general rule (Eq. 1.46) that divergence-of- curl is always zero? Show that Ampère’s law cannot be valid, in general, outside magnetostatics. Is there any such “defect”in the other three Maxwell equations? Problem 5.23. Suppose there did exist magnetic monopoles. How would you modify Maxwell’s equations and the force law to accommodate them? If you think there are several plausible options, list them, and suggest how you might decide experimentally which one is right. Problem 5.24. Why doesn’t the “dirty little secret”apply to electrostatics? 22 Electrostatic field lines do not suffer from this defect. See Prob. 5.24. 243 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 5.4.1 The Vector Potential Just as ∇ × E = 0 permitted us to introduce a scalar potential (V ) in electro- statics, E = −∇V , so ∇·B = 0 invites the introduction of a vector potential A in magnetostatics: B = ∇ × A. (5.61) The former is authorized by Theorem 1 (of Section 1.6.2), the latter by Theorem 2 (the proof of Theorem 2 is developed in Prob. 5.33). The potential formulation automatically takes care of ∇ · B = 0 (since the divergence of a curl is always zero); there remains Ampère’s law: ∇ × B = ∇ × (∇ × A) = ∇(∇ · A) −∇2A = μ0J. (5.62) Now, the electric potential had a built-in ambiguity: you can add to V any function whose gradient is zero (which is to say, any constant), without altering the physical quantity E. Likewise, you can add to A any function whose curl vanishes (which is to say, the gradient of any scalar), with no effect on B. We can exploit this freedom to eliminate the divergence of A: ∇ · A = 0. (5.63) To prove that this is always possible, suppose that our original potential, A0,is not divergenceless. If we add to it the gradient of λ (A = A0 + ∇λ), the new divergence is ∇ · A = ∇ · A0 + ∇2λ. We can accommodate Eq. 5.63, then, if a function λ can be found that satisfies ∇ 2λ = −∇ · A0. But this is mathematically identical to Poisson’s equation (2.24), ∇2V = − ρ ϵ0 , with ∇ · A0 in place of ρ/ϵ0 as the “source.” And we know how to solve Poisson’s equation – that’s what electrostatics is all about (“given the charge distribution, find the potential”). In particular, if ρ goes to zero at infinity, the solution is Eq. 2.29: V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ dτ′, 244 5 Magnetostatics and by the same token, if ∇ · A0 goes to zero at infinity, then λ = 1 4π ∫ ∇ · A0 dτ′. If ∇ · A0 does not go to zero at infinity, we’ll have to use other means to discover the appropriate λ, just as we get the electric potential by other means when the charge distribution extends to infinity. But the essential point remains: it is always possible to make the vector potential divergenceless. To put it the other way around: the definition B = ∇ × A specifies the curl of A, but it doesn’t say anything about the divergence –we are at liberty to pick that as we see fit, and zero is ordinarily the simplest choice. With this condition on A, Ampère’s law (Eq. 5.62) becomes ∇2A = −μ0J. (5.64) This again is nothing but Poisson’s equation – or rather, it is three Poisson equations, one for each Cartesian 23 component. Assuming J goes to zero at infinity, we can read off the solution: A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′) dτ′. (5.65) For line and surface currents, A = μ0 4π ∫ I dl′ = μ0I 4π ∫ 1 dl′, A = μ0 4π ∫ K da′. (5.66) (If the current does not go to zero at infinity, we have to find other ways to get A; some of these are explored in Ex. 5.12 and in the problems at the end of the section.) It must be said that A is not as useful as V . For one thing, it’s still a vector, and although Eqs. 5.65 and 5.66 are somewhat easier to work with than the Biot–Savart law, you still have to fuss with components. It would be nice if we could get away with a scalar potential B = −∇U, (5.67) but this is incompatible with Ampère’s law, since the curl of a gradient is always zero. (A magnetostatic scalar potential can be used, if you stick scrupulously to simply connected, current-free regions, but as a theoretical tool, it is of limited interest. See Prob. 5.31.) Moreover, since magnetic forces do no work, A does not admit a simple physical interpretation in terms of potential energy per unit charge. (In some contexts it can be 23 In Cartesian coordinates, ∇2A = (∇2Ax)ˆx + (∇2Ay)ˆy + (∇2Az)ˆz,so Eq. 5.64 reduces to ∇2Ax = −μ0Jx, ∇2Ay = −μ0Jy,and ∇2Az = −μ0Jz. In curvilinear coordinates the unit vectors themselves are functions of position, and must be differentiated, so it is not the case, for example, that ∇2Ar = −μ0Jr. Remember that even if you plan to evaluate integrals such as 5.65 using curvilinear coordinates, you must first express J in terms of its Cartesian components (see Section 1.4.1). 245 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential interpreted as momentum per unit charge.24) Nevertheless, the vector poten- tial has substantial theoretical importance, as we shall see in Chapter 10. Example 5.11. A spherical shell of radius R, carrying a uniform sur- face charge σ, is set spinning at angular velocity ω. Find the vector potential it produces at point r (Fig. 5.48). R ψ r w Fig. 5.48 r\u0007 r θ\u0007ψ x y z da\u0007 φ\u0007 w Fig. 5.49 Solution. It might seem natural to set the polar axis along ω, but in fact the integration is easier if we let r lie on the z-axis, so that ω is tilted at an angle ψ. We might as well orient the x-axis so that ω lies in the xz plane, as shown in Fig. 5.49. According to Eq. 5.66, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ K(r′) da′, where K = σv, = √ R2 + r2 − 2Rr cos θ′,and da′ = R2 sin θ′ dθ′ dφ′. Now the velocity of a point r′ in a rotating rigid body is given by ω ×r′; in this case, v = ω × r′ = |||||||| ˆx ˆy ˆz ω sin ψ 0 ω cos ψ R sin θ′ cos φ′ R sin θ′ sin φ′ R cos θ′ |||||||| = Rω[−(cos ψ sin θ′ sin φ′)ˆx + (cos ψ sin θ′ cos φ′ − sin ψ cos θ′)ˆy + (sin ψ sin θ′ sin φ′)ˆz]. Notice that each of these terms, save one, involves either sin φ′ or cos φ′. Since ∫ 2π 0 sin φ′ dφ′ = ∫ 2π 0 cos φ′ dφ′ = 0, such terms contribute nothing. There remains A(r) = − μ0R3σω sin ψ 2 (∫ π 0 cos θ′ sin θ′ √ R2 + r2 − 2Rr cos θ′ dθ′)ˆy. 24 M. D. Semon and J. R. Taylor, Am. J. Phys. 64, 1361 (1996). 246 5 Magnetostatics Letting u ≡ cos θ′, the integral becomes ∫ +1 −1 u √ R2 + r2 − 2Rru du = − (R2 + r 2 + Rru) 3R2r2 √ R2 + r2 − 2Rru |||| +1 −1 = − 1 3R2r2 [ (R2 + r 2 + Rr)|R − r| − (R2 + r 2 − Rr)(R + r)]. If the point r lies inside the sphere, then R > r, and this expression reduces to (2r/3R2);if r lies outside the sphere, so that R < r, it reduces to (2R/3r 2). Noting that (ω × r) = −ωr sin ψ ˆy, we have, finally, A(r) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ μ0Rσ 3 (ω × r) for points inside the sphere, μ0R4σ 3r3 (ω × r) for points outside the sphere. (5.68) Having evaluated the integral, I revert to the “natural” coordinates of Fig. 5.48, in which ω coincides with the z-axis and the point r is at (r, θ, φ): A(r, θ, φ) = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ μ0Rωσ 3 r sin θ ˆφ (r ≤ R), μ0R4ωσ 3 sin θ r2 ˆφ (r ≥ R). (5.69) Curiously, the field inside this spherical shell is uniform: B = ∇ × A = 2μ0Rωσ 3 (cos θ ˆr − sin θ ˆθ) = 2 3 μ0σRωˆz = 2 3 μ0σRω. (5.70) Example 5.12. Find the vector potential of an infinite solenoid with n turns per unit length, radius R, and current I. Solution. This time we cannot use Eq. 5.66, since the current itself extends to infinity. But here’s a cute method that does the job. Notice that ∮ A · dl = ∫ (∇ × A) · da = ∫ B · da = Φ, (5.71) where Φ is the flux of B through the loop in question. This is reminis- cent of Ampère’s law in integral form (Eq. 5.57), ∮ B · dl = μ0Ienc. In fact, it’s the same equation, with B → A and μ0Ienc → Φ. If symmetry permits, we can determine A from Φ in thesameway we got B from Ienc,in Section 5.3.3. The present problem (with a uniform longitudinal magnetic field μ0nI inside the solenoid and no field outside) is analogous to the Ampère’s law problem of a fat 247 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential wire carrying a uniformly distributed current. The vector potential is “circumferential” (it mimics the magnetic field in the analog); using a circular “Ampèrian loop” at radius s inside the solenoid, we have ∮ A · dl = A(2πs) = ∫ B · da = μ0nI (πs 2), so A = μ0nI 2 s ˆφ for s ≤ R. (5.72) For an Ampèrian loop outside the solenoid, the flux is ∫ B · da = μ0nI (πR2), since the field only extends out to R. Thus A = μ0nI 2 R2 s ˆφ for s ≥ R. (5.73) If you have any doubts about this answer, check it: Does ∇ × A = B? Does ∇ · A = 0? If so, we’re done.25 Typically, the direction of A mimics the direction of the current. For instance, both were azimuthal in Exs. 5.11 and 5.12. Indeed, if all the current flows in one direction, then Eq. 5.65 suggests that A must point that way too. Thus the potential of a finite segment of straight wire (Prob. 5.25) is in the direction of the current. Of course, if the current extends to infinity you can’t use Eq. 5.65 in the first place (see Probs. 5.28 and 5.29). Moreover, you can always add an arbitrary constant vector to A – this is analogous to changing the reference point for V , and it won’t affect the divergence or curl of A, which is all that matters (in Eq. 5.65 we have chosen the constant so that A goes to zero at infinity). In principle you could even use a vector potential that is not divergenceless, in which case all bets are off. Despite these caveats, the essential point remains: ordinarily the direction of A will match the direction of the current. Problem 5.25. Find the magnetic vector potential of a finite segment of straight wire carrying acurrent I. [Put the wire on the z-axis, from z1 to z2,and use Eq. 5.66.] Check that your answer is consistent with Eq. 5.37. Problem 5.26. (a) What current density would produce the vector potential A = k ˆφ (where k is a constant), in cylindrical coordinates? 25 Notice that A is nonzero outside the solenoid, even though B (= ∇ × A) vanishes there. In classical electrodynamics only B can exert a magnetic force on a charged particle (via the Lorentz force law). In the quantum theory, by striking contrast, the magnetic influence on a charge is expressed in terms of A, not B, and an electron passing nearby but outside the solenoid experiences a change in the phase of its wave function, which can be detected in the famous Aharonov–Bohm effect. (See, for instance, D. J. Griffiths and D. F. Schroeter, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 3rd ed., Cambridge University Press (2018), Sect. 4.5.) 248 5 Magnetostatics (b) Consider an azimuthally symmetric magnetic field; it points in the z direction, and its magnitude is a function only of s.Checkthat A = A(s) ˆφ, where A(s) = 1 s ∫ s 0 B(s′)s′ ds′, by calculating its divergence and curl. (This generalizes Ex. 5.12.) Problem 5.27. If B is uniform, show that A(r) = − 1 2 (r × B) works. That is, check that ∇ · A = 0 and ∇ × A = B. Is this result unique, or are there other functions with the same divergence and curl? Problem 5.28. (a) By whatever means you can think of (short of looking it up), find the vector potential a distance s from an infinite straight wire carrying a current I.Check that ∇ · A = 0 and ∇ × A = B. (b) Find the magnetic potential inside the wire, if it has radius R and the current is uniformly distributed. Problem 5.29. Find the vector potential above and below the plane surface current in Ex. 5.8. Problem 5.30. (a) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.63, by applying the divergence. (b) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.47, by applying the curl. (c) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.64, by applying the Laplacian. Problem 5.31. Suppose you want to define a magnetic scalar potential U (Eq. 5.67)inthe vicinity of a current-carrying wire. First of all, you must stay away from the wire itself (there ∇ × B \u0002 0); but that’s not enough. Show, by applying Ampère’s law to a path that starts at a and circles the wire, returning to b (Fig. 5.50), that the scalar potential cannot be single valued (that is, U (a) \u0002 U (b), even if they represent the same physical point). As an example, find the scalar potential for an infinite straight wire. (To avoid a multivalued potential, you must restrict yourself to simply connected regions that remain on one side or the other of every wire, never allowing you to go all the way around.) I Ampèrian loop a b Fig. 5.50 Problem 5.32. Usethe resultsof Ex. 5.11 to find the magnetic field inside a solid sphere, of uniform charge density ρ and radius R, that is rotating at a constant angular velocity ω. 249 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential Problem 5.33. (a) Complete the proof of Theorem 2, Section 1.6.2. That is, show that any divergenceless vector field F can be written as the curl of a vector potential A. What you have to do is find Ax, Ay,and Az such that (i) ∂Az/∂y − ∂Ay/∂z = Fx, (ii) ∂Ax/∂z − ∂Az/∂x = Fy, and (iii) ∂Ay/∂x − ∂Ax/∂y = Fz.Here’sone waytodoit: Pick Ax = 0, and solve (ii) and (iii) for Ay and Az. Note that the “constants of integration” are themselves functions of y and z – they’re constant only with respect to x. Now plug these expressions into (i), and use the fact that ∇ · F = 0 to obtain Ay = ∫ x 0 Fz(x′, y, z) dx′, Az = ∫ y 0 Fx(0, y′, z) dy′− ∫ x 0 Fy(x′, y, z) dx′. (b) By direct differentiation, check that the A you obtained in part (a) satisfies ∇ × A = F.Is A divergenceless? [This was a very asymmetrical construction, and it would be surprising if it were – although we know that there exists a vector whose curl is F and whose divergence is zero.] (c) As an example, let F = yˆx + zˆy + xˆz.Calculate A, and confirm that ∇ × A = F.(For further discussion, see Prob. 5.56.) 5.4.2 Boundary Conditions In Chapter 2, I drew a triangular diagram to summarize the relations among the three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: the charge density ρ, the electric field E, and the potential V . A similar figure can be con- structed for magnetostatics (Fig. 5.51), relating the current density J,the field B, and the potential A. There is one “missing link” in the diagram: the equation for A in terms of B. It’s unlikely you would ever need such a formula, but in case you are interested, see Probs. 5.55 and 5.56.ττμμμμππˆ Fig. 5.51 250 5 Magnetostatics Fig. 5.52 Fig. 5.53 Just as the electric field suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge,so the magnetic field is discontinuous at a surface current. Only this time it is the tangential component that changes. For if we apply Eq. 5.50,in integral form, ∮ B · da = 0, to a wafer-thin pillbox straddling the surface (Fig. 5.52), we get B⊥ above = B⊥ below. (5.74) As for the tangential components, an Ampèrian loop running perpendicu- lar to the current (Fig. 5.53) yields ∮ B · dl = (B ∥ above − B ∥ below)l = μ0Ienc = μ0Kl, or B ∥ above − B ∥ below = μ0K. (5.75) Thus the component of B that is parallel to the surface but perpendicular to the current is discontinuous in the amount μ0K. A similar Ampèrian loop running parallel to the current reveals that the parallel component is continuous. These results can be summarized in a single formula: Babove − Bbelow = μ0(K × ˆn), (5.76) where ˆn is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing “upward.” Like the scalar potential in electrostatics, the vector potential is contin- uous across any boundary: Aabove = Abelow, (5.77) 251 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential for ∇ · A = 0 guarantees 26 that the normal component is continuous, and ∇ × A = B,inthe form ∮ A · dl = ∫ B · da = Φ, means that the tangential components are continuous (the flux through an Ampèrian loop of vanishing thickness is zero). But the derivative of A inherits the discontinuity of B: ∂Aabove ∂n − ∂Abelow ∂n = −μ0K. (5.78) Problem 5.34. (a) Check Eq. 5.76 for the configuration in Ex. 5.9. (b) Check Eqs. 5.77 and 5.78 for the configuration in Ex. 5.11. Problem 5.35. Prove Eq. 5.78, using Eqs. 5.63, 5.76,and 5.77.[Suggestion: I’d set up Cartesian coordinates at the surface, with z perpendicular to the surface and x parallel to the current.] 5.4.3 Multipole Expansion of the Vector Potential If you want an approximate formula for the vector potential of a localized current distribution, valid at distant points, a multipole expansion is in order. Remember: the idea of a multipole expansion is to write the potential as a power series in 1/r,where r is the distance to the point in question (Fig. 5.54); if r is sufficiently large, the series will be dominated by the lowest nonvanishing contribution, and the higher terms can be ignored. As we found in Eq. 3.94, 1 = 1 √ r2 + (r′)2 − 2rr′ cos α = 1 r ∞∑ n=0 ( r′ r ) nPn(cos α), (5.79) dr\u0007\u0003\u0003\u0006\u0003dl\u0007\u0003 I α r r\u0007 Fig. 5.54 26 Note that Eqs. 5.77 and 5.78 presuppose that A is divergenceless. 252 5 Magnetostatics where α is the angle between r and r′. Accordingly, the vector potential of a current loop can be written A(r) = μ0I 4π ∮ 1 dl′ = μ0I 4π ∞∑ n=0 1 rn+1 ∮ (r′)nPn(cos α) dl′, (5.80) or, more explicitly, A(r) = μ0I 4π [ 1 r ∮ dl′ + 1 r2 ∮ r′ cos α dl′ + 1 r3 ∮ (r′)2 ( 3 2 cos2 α − 1 2 ) dl′ + ··· ]. (5.81) As in the multipole expansion of V , we call the first term (which goes like 1/r)the monopole term, the second (which goes like 1/r 2) dipole, the third quadrupole, and so on. Now, the magnetic monopole term is always zero, for the integral is just the total vector displacement around a closed loop: ∮ dl′ = 0. (5.82) This reflects the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles in nature (an assumption contained in Maxwell’s equation ∇ · B = 0, on which the entire theory of vector potential is predicated). In the absence of any monopole contribution, the dominant term is the dipole (except in the rare case where it, too, vanishes): Adip(r) = μ0I 4πr2 ∮ r′ cos α dl′ = μ0I 4πr2 ∮ (ˆr · r′) dl′. (5.83) This integral can be rewritten in a more illuminating way if we invoke Eq. 1.108, with c = ˆr: ∮ (ˆr · r′) dl′ = −ˆr × ∫ da′. (5.84) Then Adip(r) = μ0 4π m × ˆr r2 , (5.85) where m is the magnetic dipole moment: m ≡ I ∫ da = Ia. (5.86) Here a is the “vector area” of the loop (Prob. 1.62); if the loop is flat, a is the ordinary area enclosed, with the direction assigned by the usual right-hand rule (fingers in the direction of the current). 253 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential Example 5.13. Find the magnetic dipole moment of the “bookend- shaped” loop shown in Fig. 5.55. All sides have length w, and it carries a current I. I z y w w w x Fig. 5.55 Solution. This wire could be considered the superposition of two plane square loops (Fig. 5.56). The “extra” sides (AB) cancel when the two are put together, since the currents flow in opposite directions. The net magnetic dipole moment is m = Iw 2ˆy + Iw 2ˆz; its magnitude is √ 2Iw 2, and it points along the 45 ◦ line z = y. A A I I + B w w w w B Fig. 5.56 It is clear from Eq. 5.86 that the magnetic dipole moment is indepen- dent of the choice of origin. You may remember that the electric dipole moment is independent of the origin only when the total charge vanishes (Section 3.4.3). Since the magnetic monopole moment is always zero, it is not too surprising that the magnetic dipole moment is always independent of origin. Although the dipole term dominates the multipole expansion (unless m = 0) and thus offers a good approximation to the true potential, it is not ordinarily the exact potential; there will be quadrupole, octopole, and higher contributions. You might ask, is it possible to devise a current distribution whose potential is “pure” dipole – for which Eq. 5.85 is exact? Well, yes and no: like the electrical analog, it can be done, but the model is a bit contrived. To begin with, you must take an infinitesimally small loop at the origin, but then, in order to keep the dipole moment finite, you have to crank the current up to infinity, with the product m = Ia held fixed. 254 5 Magnetostatics r m θ x y z φ Fig. 5.57 y z y z (a) Field of a “pure” dipole (b) Field of a “physical” dipole Fig. 5.58 In practice, the dipole potential is a suitable approximation whenever the distance r greatly exceeds the size of the loop. The magnetic field of a (perfect) dipole is easiest to calculate if we put m at the origin and let it point in the z direction (Fig. 5.57). According to Eq. 5.85, the potential at point (r, θ, φ) is Adip(r) = μ0 4π m sin θ r2 ˆφ, (5.87) and hence Bdip(r) = ∇ × A = μ0m 4πr3 (2 cos θ ˆr + sin θ ˆθ). (5.88) Surprisingly, this is identical in structure to the field of an electric dipole (Eq. 3.103)! (Up close, however, the field of a physical magnetic dipole – a small current loop – looks quite different from the field of a physical electric dipole – plus and minus charges a short distance apart. Compare Fig. 5.58 with Fig. 3.37.) • Problem 5.36. Show that the magnetic field of a dipole can be written in coordinate-free form: Bdip(r) = μ0 4π 1 r3 [3(m · ˆr)ˆr − m].

I worked out the multipole expansion for the vector potential of a line current because that’s the most common type, and in some respects the easiest to handle. For a volume current J: (a) write down the multipole expansion, analogous to Eq. 5.80; (b) write down the monopole potential, and prove that it vanishes; (c) using Eqs. 1.107 and 5.86, show that the dipole moment can be written m = 1 2 ∫ (r × J) dτ.

Imagine two infinite straight steady currents, I1 and I2,inarbitrary relative orientations. The distance of closest approach is d, and if you slide one over (without changing its direction) so that they intersect, they would make an angle α. Calculate the magnetic force of attraction/repulsion between the currents (in the original configuration).28 [Answer: 1 2 μ0I1I2 cot α.] Problem 5.43. It may have occurred to you that since parallel currents attract, the current within a single wire should contract into a tiny concentrated stream along the axis. Yet in practice the current typically distributes itself quite uniformly over the wire. How do you account for this? If the positive charges (density ρ+) are “nailed down,”and the negative charges (density ρ−) move at speed v (and none of these depends on the distance from the axis), show that ρ− = −ρ+γ2,where γ ≡ 1/ √1 − (v/c)2 and c2 = 1/μ0ϵ0. If the wire as a whole is neutral, where is the compensating charge located?29 [Notice that for typical velocities (see Prob. 5.21), the two charge densities are essentially unchanged by the current, since γ ≈ 1. In plasmas, however, where the positive charges are also free to move, this so-called pinch effect can be very significant.] Problem 5.44. Acurrent I flows to the right through a rectangular bar of conducting material, in the presence of a uniform magnetic field B pointing out of the page (Fig. 5.59). (a) If the moving charges are positive, in which direction are they deflected by the magnetic field? This deflection results in an accumulation of charge on the upper and lower surfaces of the bar, which in turn produces an electric force to counteract the magnetic one. Equilibrium occurs when the two exactly cancel. (This is known as the Hall effect.) (b) Find the resulting potential difference (the Hall voltage) between the top and bottom of the bar, in terms of B, v (the speed of the charges), and the relevant dimensions of the bar.30 (c) How would your analysis change if the moving charges were negative?

A circularly symmetrical magnetic field (B depends only on the distance from the axis), pointing perpendicular to the page, occupies the shaded region in Fig. 5.61. R Field region Particle trajectory Fig. 5.61 (a) If the total flux ( ∫ B · da) is zero, show that a charged particle that starts out at the center (with velocity v, in the plane) will emerge from the field region on a radial path (provided it escapes at all). On the reverse trajectory, a particle fired toward the center from outside will hit its target (if it has sufficient energy), though it may follow a weird route getting there. [Hint: Calculate the total angular momentum acquired by the particle, using the Lorentz force law.] (b) Alternatively, if the speed is insufficient (v < vesc), a particle fired out from the center will reach a critical radius sc (still within the field region) and return to the center – or a particle fired radially inward from the outside will come to a critical radius and then fly back out, without ever making it to the center. Show that the critical radius is given by sc = − q 2πmv Φ(sc), where m isthemassoftheparticle, q is its charge, and v is its speed. (If there are multiple critical radii, a third possibility is for the particle to be trapped between them.) (c) Consider the case of a field that is linear in s/R (that is, B = B0[(s/R)−a]).

Use the Biot–Savart law (most conveniently in the form of Eq. 5.42 appropriate to surface currents) to find the field inside and outside an infinitely long solenoid of radius R, with n turns per unit length, carrying a steady current I. Problem 5.50. The magnetic field on the axis of a circular current loop (Eq. 5.41) is far from uniform (it falls off sharply with increasing z). You can produce a more nearly uniform field by using two such loops a distance d apart (Fig. 5.62). 32 In point of fact, the charge follows a geodesic on the cone. The original paper is H. Poincaré, Comptes rendus de l’Academie des Sciences 123, 530 (1896); for a more modern treatment, see B. Rossi and S. Olbert, Introduction to the Physics of Space, McGraw-Hill, New York (1970).

Suppose you wanted to find the field of a circular loop (Ex. 5.6)atapoint r that is not directly above the center (Fig. 5.63). You might as well choose your axes so that r lies in the yz plane at (0, y, z). The source point is (R cos φ′, R sin φ′,0),and φ′ runs from 0 to 2π.

Magnetostatics treats the “source current”(the one that sets up the field) and the “recipient current” (the one that experiences the force) so asymmetrically that it is by no means obvious that the magnetic force between two current loops is consistent with Newton’s third law.

(a) One way to fill in the “missing link”in Fig. 5.51 is to exploit the analogy between the defining equations for A (viz. ∇ · A = 0, ∇ × A = B) and Maxwell’s equations for B (viz. ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = μ0J). Evidently, A depends on B in exactly the same way that B depends on μ0J (to wit, the Biot–Savart law). Use this observation to write down the formula for A in terms of B.

As we have seen in Ex. 5.2 and Probs. 5.16, 5.46,and 5.48, the Lorentz force law can produce bizarre particle trajectories, even in relatively simple magnetic fields. Analytically soluble cases, though, are few and far between, and to explore further we must resort to numerical methods. An algorithm particularly well suited to motion in magnetostatic fields is magnetic velocity Verlet,38 which can be implemented in Mathematica using the following code: 37 The delta-function term is responsible for the hyperfine splitting in atomic spectra – see, for example, D.

[Set a = 1, μ0I/2π = 1, B0 = −(0.1, 0.1, 0.1).] Problem 5.68. In Ex. 5.6 we used the Biot–Savart law to calculate the magnetic field on the axis of a circular steady current loop of radius R.For points off the axis (Prob. 5.52) the field is more complicated;41 in cylindrical coordinates, Bz(s, φ, z) = μ0I 2π 1 √(R + s)2 + z2 [ R2 − s2 − z2 (R − s)2 + z2 E(k) + K (k)], Bs(s, φ, z) = μ0I 2π z s 1 √(R + s)2 + z2 [ R2 + s2 + z2 (R − s)2 + z2 E(k) − K (k)], where K (k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (EllipticK[k],inMath- ematica), E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind (EllipticE[k]), and k ≡ 4Rs (R + s)2 + z2 .

(b) Match the plot in (a) using magnetic velocity Verlet (Prob. 5.66). You can set m = 1, qe = 1, and v = 1, but you’ll need to figure out the initial position and velocity. (c) Notice how the charge approaches the monopole and then bounces back as the field lines converge. Of course, magnetic monopoles are (presumably) mythical, but the same “mirror” effect42 occurs in the dipole field of the Earth, causing electrons to bounce back and forth between the north and south (magnetic) poles and producing the “whistlers”that used to irritate (and mystify) amateur radio operators. Use the method of part (b) and the field of amagneticdipole(m = mˆz) to explore this phenomenon. Let μ0m/4π = 100,and start with, say, x0 = {1.,0.,0.}, v0 = {0.,1.5,-3}. You’ll discover a curious twist to the story: the electron retrace its path, but gradually circles around the globe.43 42 See A. Chambliss and J. Franklin, footnote 38. 43 This is an example of Störmer’s problem, the study of charged particle motion in the magnetic field of the Earth. C. Störmer, The Polar Aurora, Clarendon Press, Oxford (1955); Rossi and Olbert, footnote 32. 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter 6.1 Magnetization 6.1.1 Diamagnets, Paramagnets, Ferromagnets If you ask the average person what “magnetism” is, you will probably be told about refrigerator decorations, compass needles, and the North Pole – none of which has any obvious connection with moving charges or current-carrying wires. And yet, in classical electrodynamics all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion; if you could examine a piece of magnetic material on an atomic scale you would find tiny currents: electrons orbiting around nuclei and spinning about their axes.1 For macroscopic purposes, these current loops are so small that we may treat them as magnetic dipoles. Ordinarily, they cancel each other out because of the random orientation of the atoms. But when a magnetic field is applied, a net alignment of these dipoles occurs, and the medium becomes magnetically polarized, or magnetized. Unlike electric polarization, which is almost always in the same direction as E, some materials acquire a magnetization parallel to B (paramagnets) and some opposite to B (diamagnets). A few substances (called ferro- magnets, in deference to the most common example, iron) retain their magnetization even after the external field has been removed – for these, the magnetization is not determined by the present field but by the whole magnetic “history” of the object. Permanent magnets made of iron are the most familiar examples of magnetism, but from a theoretical point of view they are the most complicated; I’ll save ferromagnetism for the end of the chapter, and begin with qualitative models of paramagnetism and diamagnetism. 1 That’s the classical picture – quantum mechanics tells a quite different story: the magnetic dipole moment associated with the electron’s intrinsic spin is localized at a point and fixed in magnitude. It is notoriously misleading to model it as a tiny spinning sphere – for one thing, a point on the “equator” would be traveling much faster than the speed of light (Prob. 8.19d). You can’t speed it up (or slow it down) by applying a torque. Electrons are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle and the quantization of energy and angular momentum. These radically nonclassical objects are essential to a proper understanding of magnetism in matter. But this is a book on classical electrodynamics, in which such considerations have no place. I’ll do my best to provide a plausible account of the mechanisms involved, but remember that the resulting theory is unavoidably incomplete. 269 6.1 Magnetization 6.1.2 Torques and Forces on Magnetic Dipoles A magnetic dipole experiences a torque in a magnetic field, just as an electric dipole does in an electric field. Let’s calculate the torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform field B. (Since any current loop could be built up from infinitesimal rectangles, with all the “internal” sides canceling, as suggested in Fig. 6.1, there is no real loss of generality here; but if you prefer to start from scratch with an arbitrary shape, see Prob. 6.2.) Center the loop at the origin, and tilt it an angle θ from the z-axis toward the y-axis (Fig. 6.2). Let B point in the z direction. The forces on the two sloping sides cancel (they tend to stretch the loop, but they don’t rotate it). The forces on the “horizontal” sides are likewise equal and opposite, so the net force on the loop is zero, but they do generate a torque: N = aF sin θ ˆx. The magnitude of the force on each of these segments is F = IbB, and therefore N = IabB sin θ ˆx = mB sin θ ˆx, or N = m × B, (6.1) I Fig. 6.1 y z m F F (b) a B (a) z m x I y b a B θ θ θ θ Fig. 6.2 270 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter where m = Iab is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop. Equation 6.1 gives the torque on any localized current distribution, in the presence of a uniform field; in a nonuniform field it is the exact torque (about the center) for a perfect dipole of infinitesimal size. Notice that Eq. 6.1 is identical in form to the electrical analog, Eq. 4.4: N = p × E. In particular, the torque is again in such a direction as to line the dipole up parallel to the field. It is this torque that accounts for paramagnetism. Since every electron constitutes a magnetic dipole – picture it, if you like (just don’t tell anybody), as a tiny spinning charged sphere – you might expect paramagnetism to be a universal phenomenon. Actually, quantum mechanics (specifically, the Pauli exclusion principle) tends to lock the electrons within a given atom together in pairs with opposing spins, 2 and this effectively neutralizes the torque on the combination. As a result, paramagnetism most often occurs in atoms or molecules with an odd number of electrons, where the “extra” unpaired member is subject to the magnetic torque. Even here, the alignment is far from complete, since random thermal collisions tend to upset the order. In a uniform field, the net force on a current loop is zero: F = I ∮ (dl × B) = I (∮ dl) × B = 0; the constant B comes outside the integral, and the net displacement ∮ dl around a closed loop vanishes. In a nonuniform field this is no longer the case. For example, suppose a circular wire ring of radius R, carrying a current I, is suspended above a short solenoid in the “fringing” region (Fig. 6.3). Here B has a radial component, and there is a net downward force on the loop (Fig. 6.4): F = 2πIRB cos θ. (6.2) II B B F B F I R θ Fig. 6.3 Fig. 6.4 2 This is not always true for the outermost electrons in unfilled shells. 271 6.1 Magnetization m N S (a) Magnetic dipole (Gilbert model) p + \u0002 (b) Electric dipole m I (c) Magnetic dipole (Ampère model) Fig. 6.5 For an infinitesimal loop, with dipole moment m, in a field B, the force is F = ∇(m · B), (6.3) as you’ll see in see Prob. 6.4. Once again the magnetic formula is identical to its electrical “twin,” if we write the latter in the form F = ∇(p · E). 3 If you’re starting to get a sense of déjà vu, perhaps you will have more respect for those early physicists who thought magnetic dipoles consisted of positive and negative magnetic “charges” (north and south “poles,” they called them), separated by a small distance, just like electric dipoles (Fig. 6.5a). They wrote down a “Coulomb’s law” for the attraction and repulsion of these poles, and developed the whole of magnetostatics in exact analogy to electrostatics. It’s not a bad model, for many purposes – it gives the correct field of a dipole (at least, away from the origin), the right torque on a dipole (at least, on a stationary dipole), and the proper force on a dipole (at least, in the absence of external currents). But it’s bad physics, because there’s no such thing as a single magnetic north pole or south pole. If you break a bar magnet in half, you don’t get a north pole in one hand and a south pole in the other; you get two complete magnets. Magnetism is not due to magnetic monopoles, but rather to moving electric charges; magnetic dipoles are tiny current loops (Fig. 6.5c), and it’s an extraordinary thing, really, that the formulas involving m bear any resemblance to the corresponding formulas for p. Sometimes it is easier to think in terms of the Gilbert model of a magnetic dipole (separated monopoles), instead of the physically correct Ampère model (current loop). Indeed, this picture occasionally offers a quick and clever solution to an otherwise cumbersome problem (you just copy the corresponding result from electrostatics, changing p to m,1/ϵ0 to μ0,and E to B). But whenever the close-up features of the dipole come into play, the two models can yield strikingly different answers. My advice is to use the Gilbert model, if you like, to get an intuitive “feel” for a problem, but never rely on it for quantitative results. 3 In the spirit of the footnote to Eq. 4.5, it would be safer to write Eq. 6.3 as F = m × (∇ × B) + (m · ∇)B, since m is not to be differentiated here. 272 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter Problem 6.1.

Choose axes as shown in Fig. 6.8, and calculate F = I ∫ (dl × B) along each of the four sides. Expand B in a Taylor series – on the right-hand side, for instance, B = B(0, ϵ, z) ≈ B(0, 0, z) + ϵ ∂B ∂y |||(0,0,z). For more sophisticated methods, see Prob. 6.22 or Prob. 6.23.] Problem 6.5.

(b) Do the same for a dipole pointing in the y direction: m = m0ˆy. (c) In the electrostatic case, the expressions F = ∇(p · E) and F = (p · ∇)E are equivalent (prove it), but this is not the case for the magnetic analogs (explain why). As an example, calculate (m · ∇)B for the configurations in (a) and (b). 273 6.1 Magnetization 6.1.3 Effect of a Magnetic Field on Atomic Orbits Electrons not only spin, they also revolve around the nucleus – for simplicity, let’s assume the orbit is a circle of radius R (Fig. 6.9). Although technically this orbital motion does not constitute a steady current, in practice the period T = 2πR/v is so short that unless you blink awfully fast, it’s going to look like a steady current: I = −e T = − ev 2πR . (The minus sign accounts for the negative charge of the electron.) Accord- ingly, the orbital dipole moment (I πR 2)is m = − 1 2 evRˆz. (6.4) Like any other magnetic dipole, this one is subject to a torque (m × B) when you turn on a magnetic field. But it’s a lot harder to tilt the entire orbit than it is the spin, so the orbital contribution to paramagnetism is small. There is, however, a more significant effect on the orbital motion: The electron speeds up or slows down, depending on the orientation of B.For whereas the centripetal acceleration v2/R is ordinarily sustained by electrical forces alone, 4 1 4πϵ0 e2 R2 = me v2 R , (6.5) in the presence of a magnetic field there is an additional force, −e(v × B). For the sake of argument, let’s say that B is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, as shown in Fig. 6.10; then 1 4πϵ0 e2 R2 + e¯vB = me ¯v2 R . (6.6) Under these conditions, the new speed ¯v is greater than v: e¯vB = me R (¯v2 − v2) = me R (¯v + v)(¯v − v), z m R v \u0002e ˆ Fig. 6.9 4 To avoid confusion with the magnetic dipole moment m, I’ll write the electron mass with subscript: me. 274 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter B BB R \u0002e v \u0004e Fig. 6.10 or, assuming the change Δv = ¯v − v is small, Δv = eRB 2me . (6.7) When B is turned on, then, the electron speeds up. 5 A change in orbital speed means a change in the dipole moment (Eq. 6.4): Δm = − 1 2 e(Δv)Rˆz = − e2R2 4me B. (6.8) Notice that the change in m is opposite to the direction of B. (An electron circling the other way would have a dipole moment pointing upward, but such an orbit would be slowed down by the field, so the change is still opposite to B.) Ordinarily, the electron orbits are randomly oriented, and the orbital dipole moments cancel out. But in the presence of a magnetic field, each atom picks up a little “extra” dipole moment, and these increments are all antiparallel to the field. This is the mechanism responsible for diamagnetism. It is a universal phenomenon, affecting all atoms. However, it is typically much weaker than paramagnetism, and is therefore observed mainly in atoms with even numbers of electrons, where paramagnetism is usually absent. In deriving Eq. 6.8, I assumed that the orbit remains circular, with its original radius R. I cannot offer a justification for this at the present stage. If the atom is stationary while the field is turned on, then my assumption can be proved – this is not magnetostatics, however, and the details will have to await Chapter 7 (see Prob. 7.55). If the atom is moved into the field, the situation is enormously more complicated. But never mind – I’m only trying to give you a qualitative account of diamagnetism. Assume, if you prefer, that the velocity remains the same while the radius changes – the formula (Eq. 6.8) is altered (by a factor of 2), but the qualitative conclusion is unaffected. The truth is that this classical model is fundamentally flawed (diamagnetism is really a quantum phenomenon), so there’s not much point 5 Isaid(Eq. 5.11) that magnetic fields do no work, and are incapable of speeding a particle up. I stand by that. However, as we shall see in Chapter 7,a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, and it is the latter that accelerates the electrons in this instance. 275 6.1 Magnetization in refining the details.6 What is important is the empirical fact that in diamagnetic materials the induced dipole moments point opposite to the magnetic field. 6.1.4 Magnetization In the presence of a magnetic field, matter becomes magnetized;thatis, upon microscopic examination, it will be found to contain many tiny dipoles, with a net alignment along some direction. We have discussed two mechanisms that account for this magnetic polarization: (1) paramagnetism (the dipoles associated with the spins of unpaired electrons experience a torque tending to line them up parallel to the field) and (2) diamagnetism (the speed of the electrons is altered in such a way as to change the orbital dipole moment in a direction opposite to the field). Whatever the cause, we describe the state of magnetic polarization by the quantity M ≡ magnetic dipole moment per unit volume. (6.9) The vector M is called the magnetization; it plays a role analogous to the polarization P in electrostatics. In the following section, we will not worry about how the magnetization got there – it could be paramagnetism, diamagnetism, or even ferromagnetism – we shall take M as given,and calculate the field this magnetization itself produces. Incidentally, it may have surprised you to learn that materials other than the famous ferromagnetic trio (iron, nickel, and cobalt) are affected byamagneticfield at all. You cannot, of course, pick up a piece of wood or aluminum with a magnet. The reason is that diamagnetism and paramagnetism are extremely weak: it takes a delicate experiment and a powerful magnet to detect them at all. If you were to suspend a piece of paramagnetic material above a solenoid, as in Fig. 6.3, the induced magne- tization would be upward, and hence the force downward. By contrast, the magnetization of a diamagnetic object would be downward and the force upward. In general, when a sample is placed in a region of nonuniform field, paramagnets are attracted into the field,whereas diamagnets are repelled away. But the actual forces are pitifully weak – in a typical experimental arrangement the force on a comparable sample of iron would be 10 4 or 10 5 times as great. That’s why it was reasonable for us to calculate the field inside a piece of copper wire, say, in Chapter 5, without worrying about the effects of magnetization.7 6 S. L. O’Dell and R. K. P.

See M. V. Berry and A. K. Geim, Eur. J. Phys. 18, 307 (1997) and Geim, Physics Today September 1998, p. 36. 276 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter Problem 6.6. Of the following materials, which would you expect to be paramagnetic and which diamagnetic: aluminum, copper, copper chloride (CuCl2), carbon, lead, nitrogen (N2), salt (NaCl), sodium, sulfur, water? (Actually, copper is slightly diamagnetic; otherwise they’re all what you’d expect.)8 6.2 The Field of a Magnetized Object 6.2.1 Bound Currents Suppose we have a piece of magnetized material; the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume, M, is given. What field does this object produce? Well, the vector potential of a single dipole m is given by Eq. 5.85: A(r) = μ0 4π m × ˆ 2 . (6.10) In the magnetized object, each volume element dτ′ carries a dipole moment M dτ′, so the total vector potential is (Fig. 6.11) A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ M(r′) × ˆ 2 dτ. (6.11) That does it, in principle. But, as in the electrical case (Section 4.2.1), the integral can be cast in a more illuminating form by exploiting the identity ∇′ 1 = ˆ 2 . τ Fig. 6.11 8 In truth, the determination is more complicated than I have suggested. Although an individual atom (or molecule) with an odd number of electrons obviously has an unpaired electron, and is therefore paramagnetic, those with an even number can also have unpaired electrons (this is governed by Hund’s rule). Atomic oxygen, for example, is paramagnetic. Moreover, in molecules and solids, pairing may occur between shared electrons – thus bismuth (atomic number 83) is strongly diamagnetic in its solid phase. 277 6.2 The Field of a Magnetized Object With this, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ [M(r′) × (∇′ 1 ) ] dτ′. Integrating by parts, using product rule 7, gives A(r) = μ0 4π {∫ 1 [∇′ × M(r′)] dτ′ − ∫ ∇′ × [ M(r′) ] dτ′}. Problem 1.61b invites us to express the latter as a surface integral, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ 1 [∇′ × M(r′)] dτ′ + μ0 4π ∮ 1 [M(r′) × da′]. (6.12) The first integral looks just like the potential of a volume current, Jb = ∇ × M, (6.13) while the second looks like the potential of a surface current, Kb = M × ˆn, (6.14) where ˆn is the normal unit vector. With these definitions, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ V Jb(r′) dτ′ + μ0 4π ∮ S Kb(r′) da′. (6.15) What this means is that the potential (and hence also the field) is the same as would be produced by a volume current Jb = ∇ × M throughout the material, plus a surface current Kb = M×ˆn, on the boundary. Instead of integrating the contributions of all the infinitesimal dipoles, using Eq. 6.11, we first determine the bound currents, and then find the field they produce, in the same way we would calculate the field of any other volume and surface currents. Notice the striking parallel with the electrical case: there the field of a polarized object was the same as that of a bound volume charge ρb = −∇ · P plus a bound surface charge σb = P · ˆn. Example 6.1. Find the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere. Solution. Choosing the z-axis along the direction of M (Fig. 6.12), we have Jb = ∇ × M = 0, Kb = M × ˆn = M sin θ ˆφ. M r y z x θ φ Fig. 6.12 278 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter Now, a rotating spherical shell, of uniform surface charge σ, corre- sponds to a surface current density K = σv = σωR sin θ ˆφ. It follows, therefore, that the field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is identical to the field of a spinning spherical shell, with the identifica- tion σRωωω → M. Referring back to Ex. 5.9, B = 2 3 μ0M, (6.16) inside the sphere, while the field outside is the same as that of a perfect dipole, m = 4 3 πR3M. Notice that the internal field is uniform, like the electric field inside a uniformly polarized sphere (Eq. 4.14), although the actual formulas for the two cases are curiously different ( 2 3 in place of − 1 3 ).9 The external fields are also analogous: pure dipole in both instances. Problem 6.7. An infinitely long circular cylinder carries a uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. Find the magnetic field (due to M) inside and outside the cylinder. z R y sx φ Fig. 6.13 M a w a Fig. 6.14 Problem 6.8. A very long circular cylinder of radius R carries a magnetization M = ks2 ˆφ, where k is a constant (Fig. 6.13). Find the magnetic field due to M, for points inside and outside the cylinder (and far from the ends). Problem 6.9. A short circular cylinder of radius a and length L carries a “frozen-in”uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. Find the bound current, and sketch the magnetic field of the cylinder. (Make three sketches: one for L ≫ a,one for L ≪ a, and one for L ≈ a.) Compare this bar magnet with the bar electret of Prob. 4.11. 9 It is no accident that the same factors appear in the “contact” term for the fields of electric and magnetic dipoles (Eqs. 3.106 and 5.94). In fact, one good way to model a perfect dipole is to take the limit (R → 0) of a uniformly polarized/magnetized sphere. 279 6.2 The Field of a Magnetized Object Problem 6.10. An iron rod of length L and square cross section (side length a) is given a uniform longitudinal magnetization M, and then bent around into a circle with a narrow gap (width w), as shown in Fig. 6.14. Find the magnetic field at the center of the gap, assuming w ≪ a ≪ L.[Hint: Treat it as the superposition of a complete torus plus a square loop with reversed current.] 6.2.2 Physical Interpretation of Bound Currents In the last section, we found that the field of a magnetized object is identical to the field that would be produced by a certain distribution of “bound” currents, Jb and Kb. I want to show you how these bound currents arise physically. This will be a heuristic argument – the rigorous derivation has already been given. Figure 6.15 depicts a thin slab of uniformly magnetized material, with the dipoles represented by tiny current loops. Notice that all the “internal” currents cancel: every time there is one going to the right, a contiguous one is going to the left. However, at the edge there is no adjacent loop to do the canceling. The whole thing, then, is equivalent to a single ribbon of current I flowing around the boundary (Fig. 6.16). What is this current, in terms of M? Say that each of the tiny loops has area a and thickness t (Fig. 6.17). In terms of the magnetization M,its dipole moment is m = Mat. In terms of the circulating current I,however, m = Ia. Therefore I = Mt, so the surface current is Kb = I/t = M. Using the t I I I I I I M Fig. 6.15 M n I I ˆ Fig. 6.16 280 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter M I t a Fig. 6.17 x y z Mz(y + dy) dy Mz(y) (a) dz x y z dy My(z + dz) My(z) (b) dz Fig. 6.18 outward-drawn unit vector ˆn (Fig. 6.16), the direction of Kb is conveniently indicated by the cross product Kb = M × ˆn. (This expression also records the fact that there is no current on the top or bottom surface of the slab; here M is parallel to ˆn, so the cross product vanishes.) This bound surface current is exactly what we obtained in Section 6.2.1. It is a peculiar kind of current, in the sense that no single charge makes the whole trip – on the contrary, each charge moves only in a tiny loop within a single atom. Nevertheless, the net effect is a macroscopic current flowing over the surface of the magnetized object. We call it a “bound” current to remind ourselves that every charge is attached to a particular atom, but it’s a perfectly genuine current, and it produces a magnetic field in the same way any other current does. When the magnetization is nonuniform, the internal currents no longer cancel. Figure 6.18a shows two adjacent chunks of magnetized material, with a larger arrow on the one to the right suggesting greater magnetization at that point. On the surface where they join, there is a net current in the x direction, given by Ix = [Mz(y + dy) − Mz(y)] dz = ∂Mz ∂y dy dz. The corresponding volume current density is therefore (Jb)x = ∂Mz ∂y . 281 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H By the same token, a nonuniform magnetization in the y direction would contribute an amount −∂My/∂z (Fig. 6.18b), so (Jb)x = ∂Mz ∂y − ∂My ∂z . In general, then, Jb = ∇ × M, consistent, again, with the result of Section 6.2.1. Incidentally, like any other steady current, Jb should obey the conserva- tion law 5.33: ∇ · Jb = 0. Does it? Yes; the divergence of a curl is always zero. 6.2.3 The Magnetic Field inside Matter Like the electric field, the true microscopic magnetic field inside matter fluctuates wildly from point to point and instant to instant. When we speak of “the” magnetic field in matter, we mean the macroscopic field: the average over regions large enough to contain many atoms. (The magnetization M is “smoothed out” in the same sense.) It is this macroscopic field that one obtains when the methods of Section 6.2.1 are applied to points inside magnetized material, as you can prove for yourself in the following problem. Problem 6.11. In Sect, 6.2.1, we began with the potential of a perfect dipole (Eq. 6.10), whereas in fact we are dealing with physical dipoles. Show, by the method of Section 4.2.3,that we nonetheless get the correct macroscopic field. 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H 6.3.1 Ampère’s Law in Magnetized Materials In Section 6.2, we found that the effect of magnetization is to establish bound currents Jb = ∇ × M within the material and Kb = M × ˆn on the surface. The field due to magnetization of the medium is just the field produced by these bound currents. We are now ready to put everything together: the field attributable to bound currents, plus the field due to everything else – which I shall call the free current. The free current might flow through wires embedded in the magnetized substance or, if the latter is a conductor, through the material itself. In any event, the total current can be written as 282 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter J = Jb + Jf . (6.17) There is no new physics in Eq. 6.17; it is simply a convenience to separate the current into these two parts, because they got there by quite different means: the free current is there because somebody hooked up a wire to a battery – it involves actual transport of charge; the bound current is there because of magnetization – it results from the conspiracy of many aligned atomic dipoles. In view of Eqs. 6.13 and 6.17, Ampère’s law can be written 1 μ0 (∇ × B) = J = Jf + Jb = Jf + (∇ × M), or, collecting together the two curls, ∇ × ( 1 μ0 B − M) = Jf . The quantity in parentheses is designated by the letter H: H ≡ 1 μ0 B − M. (6.18) In terms of H, then, Ampère’s law reads ∇ × H = Jf , (6.19) or, in integral form, ∮ H · dl = Ifenc , (6.20) where Ifenc is the total free current passing through the Ampèrian loop. The vector H plays a role in magnetostatics analogous to D in electro- statics: just as D allowed us to write Gauss’s law in terms of the free charge alone, H permits us to express Ampère’s law in terms of the free current alone – and free current is what we control directly. Bound current, like bound charge, comes along for the ride – the material gets magnetized, and this results in bound currents; we cannot turn them on or off independently, as we can free currents. In applying Eq. 6.20, all we need to worry about is the free current, which we know about because we put it there. In particular, when symmetry permits, we can calculate H immediately from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampère’s law methods. (For example, Probs. 6.7 and 6.8 can be done in one line by noting that H = 0.) Example 6.2. A long copper rod of radius R carries a uniformly dis- tributed (free) current I (Fig. 6.19). Find H inside and outside the rod. Solution. Copper is weakly diamagnetic, so the dipoles will line up opposite to the field. This results in a bound current running antipar- allel to I, within the wire, and parallel to I along the surface (Fig. 6.20). Just how great these bound currents will be we are not yet in a position 283 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H Ampèrian loop s I R Fig. 6.19 I B M H Kb Jb Fig. 6.20 to say – but in order to calculate H, it is sufficient to realize that all the currents are longitudinal, so B, M, and therefore also H, are circum- ferential. Applying Eq. 6.20 to an Ampèrian loop of radius s < R, H (2πs) = Ifenc = I πs 2 πR2 , so, inside the wire, H = I 2πR2 s ˆφ (s ≤ R). (6.21) Outside the wire H = I 2πs ˆφ (s ≥ R). (6.22) In the latter region (as always, in empty space) M = 0,so B = μ0H = μ0I 2πs ˆφ (s ≥ R), thesameasfor a nonmagnetized wire (Ex. 5.7). Inside the wire, B cannot be determined at this stage, since we have no way of knowing M (though in practice the magnetization in copper is so slight that for most purposes we can ignore it altogether). As it turns out, H is a more useful quantity than D. In the laboratory, you will frequently hear people talking about H (more often even than B), but you will never hear anyone speak of D (only E). The reason is this: To build an electromagnet you run a certain (free) current through a coil. The current is the thing you read on the dial, and this determines H (or at any rate, the 284 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter line integral of H); B depends on the specific materials you used and even, if iron is present, on the history of your magnet. On the other hand, if you want to set up an electric field, you do not plaster a known free charge on the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor; rather, you connect them to a battery of known voltage.It’sthe potential difference you read on your dial, and that determines E (or rather, the line integral of E); D depends on the details of the dielectric you’re using. If it were easy to measure charge, and hard to measure potential, then you’d find experimentalists talking about D instead of E. So the relative familiarity of H, as contrasted with D, derives from purely practical considerations; theoretically, they’re on an equal footing. Many authors call H, not B, the “magnetic field.” Then they have to invent a new word for B: the “flux density,” or magnetic “induction” (an absurd choice, since that term already has at least two other meanings in electrodynamics). Anyway, B is indisputably the fundamental quantity (and it’s the thing that goes in the Lorentz force law), so I shall continue to call it the “magnetic field.” The quantity H has no sensible name: just call it “H.” 10 Problem 6.12. An infinitely long cylinder, of radius R, carries a “frozen-in” magnetization, parallel to the axis, M = ksˆz, where k is a constant and s is the distance from the axis; there is no free current anywhere. Find the magnetic field inside and outside the cylinder by two different methods: (a) As in Section 6.2, locate all the bound currents, and calculate the field they produce. (b) Use Ampère’s law (in the form of Eq. 6.20)tofind H, and then get B from Eq. 6.18.(Notice that the second method is much faster, and avoids any explicit reference to the bound currents.) Problem 6.13. Suppose the field inside a large piece of magnetic material is B0,sothat H0 = (1/μ0)B0 − M,where M is a “frozen-in”magnetization. (a) Now a small spherical cavity is hollowed out of the material (Fig. 6.21). Find the field at the center of the cavity, in terms of B0 and M.Alsofind H at thecenterofthe cavity,interms of H0 and M. (b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to M. (c) Do the same for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to M. 10 For those who disagree, I quote A. Sommerfeld’s Electrodynamics, Academic Press, New York (1952), p. 45: “The unhappy term ‘magnetic field’ for H should be avoided as far as possible. It seems to us that this term has led into error none less than Maxwell himself.” The H due to magnetization (as opposed to free currents) is sometimes called the demagnetization field, because it tends to oppose M (see, for example, Prob. 6.14). 285 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H (a) Sphere (b) Needle (c) Wafer M Fig. 6.21 Assume the cavities are small enough so M, B0,and H0 are essentially constant. Compare Prob. 4.16.[Hint: Carving out a cavity is the same as superimposing an object of the same shape but opposite magnetization.] 6.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel Equation 6.19 looks just like Ampère’s original law (Eq. 5.56), except that the total current is replaced by the free current, and B is replaced by μ0H. As in the case of D, however, I must warn you against reading too much into this correspondence. It does not say that μ0H is “just like B, only its source is Jf instead of J.” For the curl alone does not determine a vector field – you must also know the divergence. And whereas ∇ · B = 0, the divergence of H is not, in general, zero. In fact, from Eq. 6.18, ∇ · H = −∇ · M. (6.23) Only when the divergence of M vanishes (everywhere) is the parallel between B and μ0H faithful. In particular, there is (in general) no “Biot– Savart” law giving H in terms of the free current, and there is no vector potential for H. If you think I’m being pedantic, consider the example of the bar magnet – a short cylinder of iron that carries a permanent uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. (See Probs. 6.9 and 6.14.) In this case there is no free current anywhere, and a naïve application of Eq. 6.20 might lead you to suppose that H = 0, and hence that B = μ0M inside the magnet and B = 0 outside, which is nonsense. It is quite true that the curl of H vanishes everywhere, but the divergence does not. (Can you see where ∇ · M \u0002 0?) Advice: When youare askedtofind B or H in a problem involving magnetic materials, first look for symmetry. If the problem exhibits cylindrical, plane, solenoidal, or toroidal symmetry, then you can get H directly from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampère’s law methods. (Evidently, in such cases ∇ · M is automatically zero, since the free current alone determines the answer.) If 286 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter the requisite symmetry is absent, you’ll have to think of another approach, and in particular you must not assume that H is zero just because there is no free current in sight. 6.3.3 Boundary Conditions The magnetostatic boundary conditions of Section 5.4.2 can be rewritten in terms of H and the free current. From Eq. 6.23 it follows that H⊥ above − H⊥ below = −(M⊥ above − M⊥ below), (6.24) while Eq. 6.19 says H ∥ above − H ∥ below = Kf × ˆn. (6.25) In the presence of materials, these are sometimes more useful than the corresponding boundary conditions on B (Eqs. 5.74 and 5.76): B⊥ above − B⊥ below = 0 (6.26) and B ∥ above − B ∥ below = μ0(K × ˆn). (6.27) You might want to check them, for Ex. 6.2 or Prob. 6.14. Problem 6.14. For the bar magnet of Prob. 6.9, make careful sketches of M, B,and H, assuming L is about 2a.Compare Prob. 4.17. Problem 6.15. If Jf = 0 everywhere, the curl of H vanishes (Eq. 6.19), and we can express H as the gradient of a scalar potential W : H = −∇W . According to Eq. 6.23, then, ∇ 2W = ∇ · M, so W obeys Poisson’s equation, with −∇ · M as the “source.”This opens up all the machinery of Chapter 3. As an example, find the field inside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Ex. 6.1)by separation of variables. [Hint: ∇ · M = 0 everywhere except at the surface (r = R), so W satisfies Laplace’s equation in the regions r < R and r > R;use Eq. 3.65,and from Eq. 6.24 figure out the appropriate boundary condition on W .] 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 6.4.1 Magnetic Susceptibility and Permeability In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, the magnetization is sustained by the field; when B is removed, M disappears. In fact, for most substances 287 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media the magnetization is proportional to the field, provided the field is not too strong. For notational consistency with the electrical case (Eq. 4.30), I should express the proportionality thus: M = 1 μ0 χmB (incorrect!) (6.28) But custom dictates that it be written in terms of H, instead of B: M = χmH. (6.29) The constant of proportionality χm is called the magnetic susceptibility;it is a dimensionless quantity that varies from one substance to another – positive for paramagnets and negative for diamagnets. Typical values are around 10 −5 (see Table 6.1). Materials that obey Eq. 6.29 are called linear media. In view of Eq. 6.18, B = μ0(H + M) = μ0(1 + χm)H (6.30) for linear media. Thus B is also proportional to H: 11 B = μH, (6.31) where μ ≡ μ0(1 + χm). (6.32) The quantity μ is called the permeability of the material. 12 In a vacuum, where there is no matter to magnetize, the susceptibility χm vanishes, and the permeability is μ0.That’swhy μ0 is called the permeability of free space. Table 6.1. Magnetic susceptibilities (unless otherwise specified, values are for 1 atm, 20◦C). Data from Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 91st ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton (2010) and other references. Material Susceptibility Material Susceptibility Diamagnetic: Paramagnetic: Bismuth −1.7 × 10 −4 Oxygen (O2)1.7 × 10 −6 Gold −3.4 × 10 −5 Sodium 8.5 × 10 −6 Silver −2.4 × 10 −5 Aluminum 2.2 × 10 −5 Copper −9.7 × 10 −6 Tungsten 7.0 × 10 −5 Water −9.0 × 10 −6 Platinum 2.7 × 10 −4 Carbon dioxide −1.1 × 10 −8 Oxygen (liquid) (−200 ◦C) 3.9 × 10 −3 Hydrogen (H2) −2.1 × 10 −9 Gadolinium 4.8 × 10 −1 11 Physically, therefore, Eq. 6.28 would say exactly the same as Eq. 6.29, only the constant χm would have a different value. Equation 6.29 is a little more convenient, because experimentalists find it handier to work with H than B. 12 If you factor out μ0, what’s left is called the relative permeability: μr ≡ 1 + χm = μ/μ0. By the way, formulas for H in terms of B (Eq. 6.31, in the case of linear media) are called constitutive relations, just like those for D in terms of E. 288 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter zˆ φ Fig. 6.22 Example 6.3. An infinite solenoid (n turns per unit length, current I)is filled with linear material of susceptibility χm. Find the magnetic field inside the solenoid. Solution. Since B is due in part to bound currents (which we don’t yet know), we cannot compute it directly. However, this is one of those symmetrical cases in which we can get H from the free current alone, using Ampère’s law in the form of Eq. 6.20: H = nIˆz (Fig. 6.22). According to Eq. 6.31, then, B = μ0(1 + χm)nIˆz. If the medium is paramagnetic, the field is somewhat enhanced; if it’s diamagnetic, the field is slightly reduced. This reflects the fact that the bound surface current Kb = M × ˆn = χm(H × ˆn) = χmnI ˆφ is in the same direction as I, in the former case (χm > 0), and opposite in the latter (χm < 0). You might suppose that linear media escape the defect in the parallel between B and H: since M and H are now proportional to B, does it not follow that their divergence, like B’s, must always vanish? Unfortunately, it does not; 13 at the boundary between two materials of different permeability, thedivergenceof M can actually be infinite. For instance, at the end of a cylinder of linear paramagnetic material, M is zero on one side but not on the other. For the “Gaussian pillbox” shown in Fig. 6.23, ∮ M · da \u0002 0, and hence, by the divergence theorem, ∇ · M cannot vanish everywhere within it. Incidentally, the volume bound current density in a homogeneous linear material is proportional to the free current density: 13 Formally, ∇ · H = ∇ · ( 1 μ B) = 1 μ ∇ · B + B · ∇( 1 μ ) = B · ∇( 1 μ ),so H is not divergenceless (in general) at points where μ is changing. 289 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media M Paramagnet Gaussian pillbox M = 0 Vacuum Fig. 6.23 Jb = ∇ × M = ∇ × (χmH) = χmJf . (6.33) In particular, unless free current actually flows through the material, all bound current will be at the surface. Problem 6.16. A coaxial cable consists of two very long cylindrical tubes, separated by linear insulating material of magnetic susceptibility χm.Acurrent I flows down the inner conductor and returns along the outer one; in each case, the current distributes itself uniformly over the surface (Fig. 6.24). Find the magnetic field in the region between the tubes. As a check, calculate the magnetization and the bound currents, and confirm that (together, of course, with the free currents) they generate the correct field. I I b a Fig. 6.24 Problem 6.17. A (free) current I flows down a long straight wire of radius a. If the wire is made of linear material (copper, say, or aluminum) with susceptibility χm,andthecurrent is distributed uniformly, what is the magnetic field a distance s from the axis? Find all the bound currents. What is the net bound current flowing down the wire? ! Problem 6.18. A sphere of linear magnetic material is placed in an otherwise uniform mag- netic field B0. Find the field inside the sphere. [Hint: See Prob. 6.15 or Prob. 4.23.] Problem 6.19. On the basis of the naïve model presented in Section 6.1.3, estimate the magnetic susceptibility of a diamagnetic metal such as copper. Compare your answer with the empirical value in Table 6.1, and comment on any discrepancy. 6.4.2 Ferromagnetism In a linear medium, the alignment of atomic dipoles is maintained by a magnetic field imposed from the outside. Ferromagnets – which are 290 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter Fig. 6.25 emphatically not linear 14 – require no external fields to sustain the mag- netization; the alignment is “frozen in.” Like paramagnetism, ferromag- netism involves the magnetic dipoles associated with the spins of unpaired electrons. The new feature, which makes ferromagnetism so different from paramagnetism, is the interaction between nearby dipoles: in a ferromag- net, each dipole “likes” to point in the same direction as its neighbors.The reason for this preference is essentially quantum mechanical, and I shall not endeavor to explain it here; it is enough to know that the correlation is so strong as to align virtually 100 percent of the unpaired electron spins. If you could somehow magnify a piece of iron and “see” the individual dipoles as tiny arrows, it would look something like Fig. 6.25, with all the spins pointing the same way. But if that is true, why isn’t every wrench and skillet a powerful magnet? The answer is that the alignment occurs in relatively small patches, called domains. Each domain contains billions of dipoles, all lined up (these domains are actually visible under a microscope, using suitable etching techniques – see Fig. 6.26), but the domains themselves are randomly ori- ented. The household wrench contains an enormous number of domains, and their magnetic fields cancel, so the wrench as a whole is not magnetized. (Actually, the orientation of domains is not completely random; within a given crystal, there may be some preferential alignment along the crystal axes. But there will be just as many domains pointing one way as the other, so there is still no large-scale magnetization. Moreover, the crystals themselves are randomly oriented within any sizable chunk of metal.) How, then, would you produce a permanent magnet, such as they sell in toy stores? If you put a piece of iron into a strong magnetic field, the torque N = m × B tends to align the dipoles parallel to the field. Since they like to stay parallel to their neighbors, most of the dipoles will resist this torque. However, at the boundary between two domains, there are competing neighbors, and the torque will throw its weight on the side of the domain most nearly parallel to the field; this domain will win some converts, at the 14 In this sense, it is misleading to speak of the susceptibility or permeability of a ferromagnet. The terms are used for such materials, but they refer to the proportionality factor between a differential increase in H and the resulting differential change in M (or B); moreover, they are not constants, but functions of H. 291 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media Ferromagnetic domains. (Photo courtesy of R. W. DeBlois) Fig. 6.26 I Fig. 6.27 expense of the less favorably oriented one. The net effect of the magnetic field, then, is to move the domain boundaries. Domains parallel to the field grow, and the others shrink. If the field is strong enough, one domain takes over entirely,and theironissaidtobe saturated. It turns out that this process (the shifting of domain boundaries in response to an external field) is not entirely reversible: when the field is switched off, there will be some return to randomly oriented domains, but it is far from complete – there remains a preponderance of domains in the original direction. You now have a permanent magnet. A simple way to accomplish this, in practice, is to wrap a coil of wire around the object to be magnetized (Fig. 6.27). Run a current I through the coil; this provides the external magnetic field (pointing to the left in the diagram). As you increase the current, the field increases, the domain boundaries move, and the magnetization grows. Eventually, you reach the saturation point, with all the dipoles aligned, and a further increase in current has no effect on M (Fig. 6.28, point b). 292 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter I M e a c b d f (Permanent magnet) (Saturation) (Permanent magnet)(Saturation) g Fig. 6.28 Now suppose you reduce the current. Instead of retracing the path back to M = 0, there is only a partial return to randomly oriented domains; M decreases, but even with the current off there is some residual magnetization (point c). The wrench is now a permanent magnet. If you want to eliminate the remaining magnetization, you’ll have to run a current backward through the coil (a negative I). Now the external field points to the right, and as you increase I (negatively), M drops down to zero (point d). If you turn I still higher, you soon reach saturation in the other direction – all the dipoles now pointing to the right (point e). At this stage, switching off the current will leave the wrench with a permanent magnetization to the right (point f). To complete the story, turn I on again in the positive sense: M returns to zero (point g), and eventually to the forward saturation point (b). The path we have traced out is called a hysteresis loop. Notice that the magnetization of the wrench depends not only on the applied field (that is, on I), but also on its previous magnetic “history.” 15 For instance, at three different times in our experiment the current was zero (a, c,and f), yet the magnetization was different for each of them. Actually, it is customary to draw hysteresis loops as plots of B against H, rather than M against I.(If our coil is approximated by a long solenoid, with n turns per unit length, then H = nI,so H and I are proportional. Meanwhile, B = μ0(H + M), but in practice M is huge compared to H, so to all intents and purposes B is proportional to M. 16) To make the units consistent (teslas), I have plotted (μ0H) horizontally (Fig. 6.29); notice, however, that the vertical scale is 104 times greater than the horizontal one. Roughly speaking, μ0H is the field our coil would have produced in the absence of any iron; B is what we actually got, and compared to μ0H, it is gigantic. A little current goes a long way, when 15 Etymologically, the word hysteresis has nothing to do with the word history – nor with the word hysteria. It derives from a Greek verb meaning “lag behind.” 16 For very large H, with M constant (saturated), B becomes proportional to H, so whereas the wings in Fig. 6.28 extend out horizontally, in Fig. 6.29 they increase linearly. 293 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 1.5 \u000215 1 0.5 \u00020.5 \u00021 \u00021.5 \u00025 5 10 15 (μ0H\t10 4)20 B \u000210 Fig. 6.29 you have ferromagnetic materials around. That’s why anyone who wants to make a powerful electromagnet will wrap the coil around an iron core. It doesn’t take much of an external field to move the domain boundaries, and when you do that, you have all the dipoles in the iron working with you. One final point about ferromagnetism: it all follows, remember, from the fact that the dipoles within a given domain line up parallel to one another. Random thermal motions compete with this ordering, but as long as the temperature doesn’t get too high, they cannot budge the dipoles out of line. It’s not surprising, though, that very high temperatures do destroy the alignment. What is surprising is that this occurs at a precise temperature (770 ◦C, for iron). Below this temperature (called the Curie point), iron is ferromagnetic; above, it is paramagnetic. The abrupt change is an example of a phase transition, like the freezing or boiling of water. Problem 6.20. How would you go about demagnetizing a permanent magnet (such as the wrench we have been discussing, at point c in the hysteresis loop)? That is, how could you restore it to its original state, with M = 0 at I = 0? Problem 6.21. (a) Show that the energy of a magnetic dipole m in a magnetic field B is U = −m · B. (6.34) [Assume that the magnitude of the dipole moment is fixed, and all you have to do is move it into place and rotate it into its final orientation. The energy required to keep the current flowing is a different problem, which we will confront in Chapter 7.] Compare Eq. 4.6. (b) Show that the interaction energy of two magnetic dipoles separated by a displacement r is given by U = μ0 4π 1 r3 [m1 · m2 − 3(m1 · ˆr)(m2 · ˆr)]. (6.35) Compare Eq. 4.7. 294 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter m1 m2 rθ1 θ2 Fig. 6.30 (c) Express your answer to (b) in terms of the angles θ1 and θ2 in Fig. 6.30, and use the result to find the stable configuration two dipoles would adopt if held a fixed distance apart, but left free to rotate. (d) Suppose you had a large collection of compass needles, mounted on pins at regular intervals along a straight line. How would they point (assuming the Earth’s magnetic field can be neglected)? [A rectangular array of compass needles aligns itself spontaneously, and this is sometimes used as a demonstration of “ferromagnetic” behavior on a large scale. It’s a bit of a fraud, however, since the mechanism here is purely classical, and much weaker than the quantum mechanical exchange forces that are actually responsible for ferromagnetism.17] More Problems on Chapter 6 ! Problem 6.22. In Prob. 6.4, you calculated the force on a dipole by “brute force.”Here’s a more elegant approach. First write B(r) as a Taylor expansion about the center of the loop: B(r) \u0003 B(r0) + [(r − r0) · ∇0]B(r0), where r0 is the position of the dipole and ∇0 denotes differentiation with respect to r0.Put this into the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.16)toobtain F = I ∮ dl × [(r · ∇0)B(r0)]. Or, numbering the Cartesian coordinates from 1 to 3, Fi = I 3∑ j,k,l=1 ϵijk {∮ rl dlj}[∇0l Bk(r0)], where ϵijk is the Levi-Civita symbol (+1 if ijk = 123, 231,or 312; −1 if ijk = 132, 213,or 321; 0 otherwise), in terms of which the cross product can be written (A × B)i = ∑3 j,k=1 ϵijkAjBk.Use Eq. 1.108 to evaluate the integral. Note that 3∑ j=1 ϵijkϵljm = δil δkm − δimδkl, where δij is the Kronecker delta (Prob. 3.57). 17 For an intriguing exception, see B. Parks, Am.J.Phys. 74, 351 (2006), Sect. II. 295 More Problems on Chapter 6 Problem 6.23. Here’s a three-line proof of Eq. 6.3:18 Use Prob. 1.61f to show that the force on a current loop can be written F = I ∫ ∇(B · da). (The integration is over the area enclosed by the loop, and ∇ acts only on B.) Now suppose the loop is very small, so derivatives of B are essentially constant over the area: ∇[B(r) · da] ≈ ∇0[B(r0) · da],where r0 is the “center” of the loop. Take it from there …. Problem 6.24. A familiar toy consists of donut-shaped permanent magnets (magnetization parallel to the axis), which slide frictionlessly on a vertical rod (Fig. 6.31). Treat the magnets as dipoles, with mass md and dipole moment m. (a) If you put two back-to-back magnets on the rod, the upper one will “float”– the magnetic force upward balancing the gravitational force downward. At what height (z) does it float? (b) If you now add a third magnet (parallel to the bottom one), what is the ratio of the two heights? (Determine the actual number, to three significant digits.)

Imagine two charged magnetic dipoles (charge q, dipole moment m), con- strained to move on the z-axis (same as Prob. 6.24a, but without gravity). Electrically they repel, but magnetically (if both m’s point in the z direction) they attract. (a) Find the equilibrium separation distance.

Notice the following parallel: ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪ ⎩ ∇ · D = 0, ∇ × E = 0, ϵ0E = D − P (no free charge), ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × H = 0, μ0H = B − μ0M (no free current). 18 Suggested by K. T. McDonald. 296 6 MagneticFieldsinMatter Thus, the transcription D → B, E → H, P → μ0M, ϵ0 → μ0 turns an electrostatic problem into an analogous magnetostatic one. Use this, together with your knowledge of the electrostatic results, to rederive: (a) the magnetic field inside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Eq. 6.16); (b) the magnetic field inside a sphere of linear magnetic material in an otherwise uniform magnetic field (Prob. 6.18); (c) the average magnetic field over a sphere, due to steady currents within the sphere (Eq. 5.93). Problem 6.27. Compare Eqs. 2.15, 4.9,and 6.11.Noticethatif ρ, P,and M are uniform,the same integral is involved in all three: ∫ ˆ 2 dτ′. Therefore, if you happen to know the electric field of a uniformly charged object, you can immediately write down the scalar potential of a uniformly polarized object, and the vector potentialofauniformly magnetized object, of the same shape. Use this observation to obtain V inside and outside a uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2), and A inside and outside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Ex. 6.1). μ2 μ1 B2 B1 θ1 θ2 Fig. 6.32 Problem 6.28.

Show that the magnetic field inside the sphere (0 < r ≤ R)is μ 4π { 1 r3 [3(m · ˆr)ˆr − m] + 2(μ0 − μ)m (2μ0 + μ)R3 }. What is the field outside the sphere? 297 More Problems on Chapter 6 Problem 6.30. You are asked to referee a grant application, which proposes to determine whether the magnetization of iron is due to “Ampère”dipoles (current loops) or “Gilbert”dipoles (separated magnetic monopoles). The experiment will involve a cylinder of iron (radius R and length L = 10R), uniformly magnetized along the direction of its axis. If the dipoles are Ampère type, the magnetization is equivalent to a surface bound current Kb = M ˆφ;ifthey are Gilbert type, the magnetization is equivalent to surface monopole densities σb = ±M at the two ends. Unfortunately, these two configurations produce identical magnetic fields, at exterior points. However, the interior fields are radically different – in the first case B is in the same general direction as M, whereas in the second it is roughly opposite to M. The applicant proposes to measure this internal field by carving out a small cavity and finding the torque on a tiny compass needle placed inside. Assuming that the obvious technical difficulties can be overcome, and that the question itself is worthy of study, would you advise funding this experiment? If so, what shape cavity would you recommend? If not, what is wrong with the proposal? [Hint: Refer to Probs. 4.11, 4.16, 6.9,and 6.13.] 7 Electrodynamics 7.1 Electromotive Force 7.1.1 Ohm’s Law To make a current flow, you have to push on the charges. How fast they move, in response to a given push, depends on the nature of the material. For most substances, the current density J is proportional to the force per unit charge, f: J = σf. (7.1) The proportionality factor σ (not to be confused with surface charge) is an empirical constant that varies from one material to another; it’s called the conductivity of the medium. Actually, the handbooks usually list the reciprocal of σ, called the resistivity: ρ = 1/σ (not to be confused with charge density – I’m sorry, but we’re running out of Greek letters, and this is the standard notation). Some typical values are listed in Table 7.1. Notice that even insulators conduct slightly, though the conductivity of a metal is astronomically greater; in fact, for most purposes metals can be regarded as perfect conductors, with σ = ∞, while for insulators we can pretend σ = 0. In principle, the force that drives the charges to produce the current could be anything – chemical, gravitational, or trained ants with tiny harnesses. For our purposes, though, it’s usually an electromagnetic force that does the job. In this case Eq. 7.1 becomes J = σ(E + v × B). (7.2) Ordinarily, the velocity of the charges is sufficiently small that the second term can be ignored: J = σE. (7.3) (However, in plasmas, for instance, the magnetic contribution to f can be significant.) Equation 7.3 is called Ohm’s law, though the physics behind it is really contained in Eq. 7.1, of which 7.3 is just a special case. I know: you’re confused because I said E = 0 inside a conductor (Section 2.5.1). But that’s for stationary charges (J = 0). Moreover, for perfect conductors E = J/σ = 0 even if current is flowing. In practice, metals are such good conductors that the electric field required to drive current in 299 7.1 Electromotive Force Table 7.1. Resistivities, in ohm meters (all values are for 1 atm, 20◦C).

Thus we routinely treat the connecting wires in electric circuits (for example) as equipotentials. Resistors, by contrast, are made from poorly conducting materials. Example 7.1. A cylindrical resistor of cross-sectional area A and length L is made from material with conductivity σ. (See Fig. 7.1; as indicated, the cross section need not be circular, but I do assume it is the same all the way down.) If we stipulate that the potential is constant over each end, and the potential difference between the ends is V , what current flows? E L z A Fig. 7.1 Solution. As it turns out, the electric field is uniform within the wire (I’ll prove this in a moment). It follows from Eq. 7.3 that the current density is also uniform, so I = JA = σEA = σA L V . Example 7.2. Two long coaxial metal cylinders (radii a and b)are sep- arated by material of conductivity σ (Fig. 7.2). If they are maintained at a potential difference V , what current flows from one to the other, in a length L? 300 7 Electrodynamics E L b a Fig. 7.2 Solution. The field between the cylinders is E = λ 2πϵ0sˆs, where λ is the charge per unit length on the inner cylinder. The current is therefore I = ∫ J · da = σ ∫ E · da = σ ϵ0 λL. (The integral is over any surface enclosing the inner cylinder.) Mean- while, the potential difference between the cylinders is V = − ∫ a b E · dl = λ 2πϵ0 ln( b a ), so I = 2πσL ln(b/a) V . As these examples illustrate, the total current flowing from one electrode to the other is proportional to the potential difference between them: V = IR. (7.4) This, of course, is the more familiar version of Ohm’s law. The constant of proportionality R is called the resistance; it’s a function of the geometry of the arrangement and the conductivity of the medium between the elec- trodes. (In Ex. 7.1, R = (L/σA);in Ex. 7.2, R = ln(b/a)/2πσL.) Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω): an ohm is a volt per ampere. Notice that the proportionality between V and I is a direct consequence of Eq. 7.3:if you want to double V , you simply double the charge on the electrodes – that doubles E, which (for an ohmic material) doubles J, which doubles I. For steady currents and uniform conductivity, ∇ · E = 1 σ ∇ · J = 0 (7.5) (Eq. 5.33), and therefore the charge density is zero; any unbalanced charge resides on the surface. (We proved this long ago, for the case of stationary charges, using the fact that E = 0; turns out, it is still true when steady currents flow, for media satisfying Eq. 7.3.) It follows, in particular, that Laplace’s equation holds within a homogeneous ohmic material carrying 301 7.1 Electromotive Force a steady current, so all the tools and tricks of Chapter 3 are available for calculating the potential. Example 7.3. I asserted that the field in Ex. 7.1 is uniform. Let’s prove it. Solution. Within the cylinder V obeys Laplace’s equation. What are the boundary conditions? At the left-hand end the potential is constant – we may as well set it equal to zero. At the right-hand end the potential is likewise constant – call it V0. On the cylindrical surface, J · ˆn = 0, or else charge would be leaking out into the surrounding space (which we take to be nonconducting). Therefore E · ˆn = 0, and hence ∂V /∂n = 0. With V or its normal derivative specified on all surfaces, the field is uniquely determined (Prob. 3.5). But it’s easy to guess one potential that obeys Laplace’s equation and fits these boundary conditions: V (z) = V0z L , where z is measured along the axis. The uniqueness theorem guarantees that this is the solution. The corresponding field is E = −∇V = − V0 L ˆz, which is indeed uniform. V = 0 V0 E Fig. 7.3 Contrast the enormously more difficult problem that arises if the conducting material is removed, leaving only a metal plate at either end (Fig. 7.3). Evidently, in the present case charge arranges itself over the surface of the wire in just such a way as to produce a nice uniform field within. 1 I don’t suppose there is any formula in physics more familiar than Ohm’s law, and yet it’s not really a true law, in the sense of Coulomb’s or Ampère’s; rather, it is a “rule of thumb” that applies pretty well to many substances. You’re not going to win a Nobel prize for finding an exception. In fact, when you stop to think about it, it’s a little surprising that Ohm’s law ever holds. 1 Calculating this surface charge is not easy. See, for example, J. D. Jackson, Am. J. Phys. 64, 855 (1996). Nor is it a simple matter to determine the field outside thewire–see Prob. 7.45. 302 7 Electrodynamics After all, a given field E produces a force qE (on a charge q), and according to Newton’s second law, the charge will accelerate. But if the charges are accelerating, why doesn’t the current increase with time, growing larger and larger the longer you leave the field on? Ohm’s law implies, on the contrary, that a constant field produces a constant current, which suggests a constant velocity. Doesn’t that contradict Newton’s law? No, for we are forgetting the frequent collisions electrons make as they pass down the wire. It’s a little like this: Suppose you’re driving down a street with a stop sign at every intersection, so that, although you accelerate constantly in between, you are obliged to start all over again with each new block. Your average speed is then a constant, in spite of the fact that (save for the periodic abrupt stops) you are always accelerating. If the length of a block is λ and your acceleration is a, the time it takes to go a block is t = √ 2λ a , and hence your average velocity is vave = 1 2 at = √ λa 2 . But wait! That’s no good either! It says that the velocity is proportional to the square root of the acceleration, and therefore that the current should be proportional to the square root of the field! There’s another twist to the story: In practice, the charges are already moving very fast because of their thermal energy. But the thermal velocities have random directions, and average to zero. The drift velocity we are concerned with is a tiny extra bit (Prob. 5.21). So the time between collisions is actually much shorter than we supposed; if we assume for the sake of argument that all charges travel the same distance λ between collisions, then t = λ vthermal , and therefore vave = 1 2 at = aλ 2vthermal . If there are n molecules per unit volume, and f free electrons per molecule, each with charge q and mass m, the current density is J = nfqvave = nfqλ 2vthermal F m = ( nf λq 2 2mvthermal )E. (7.6) I don’t claim that the term in parentheses is an accurate formula for the conductivity, 2 but it does indicate the basic ingredients, and it correctly predicts that conductivity is proportional to the density of the moving charges and (ordinarily) decreases with increasing temperature. 2 This classical model (due to Drude) bears little resemblance to the modern quantum theory of conductivity. See, for instance, D. Park’s Introduction to the Quantum Theory, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York (1992), Chap. 15. 303 7.1 Electromotive Force As a result of all the collisions, the work done by the electrical force is converted into heat in the resistor. Since the work done per unit charge is V and the charge flowing per unit time is I, the power delivered is P = VI = I 2R. (7.7) This is the Joule heating law. With I in amperes and R in ohms, P comes out in watts (joules per second). a b (a) (b) σ Fig. 7.4 Problem 7.1.

(c) Notice that if b ≫ a the outer radius (b) is irrelevant. How do you account for that?

Suppose the conductivity of the material separating the cylinders in Ex. 7.2 is not uniform; specifically, σ(s) = k/s,for some constant k. Find the resistance between the cylinders. [Hint: Because σ is a function of position, Eq. 7.5 does not hold, the charge density is not zero in the resistive medium, and E does not go like 1/s.But we do know that for steady currents I is the same across each cylindrical surface. Take it from there.] 7.1.2 Electromotive Force If you think about a typical electric circuit – a battery hooked up to a light bulb, say (Fig. 7.7) – a perplexing question arises: In practice, the current is the same all the way around the loop; why is this the case, when the only obvious driving force is inside the battery? Off hand, you might expect a large current in the battery and none at all in the lamp. Who’s doing the pushing, in the rest of the circuit, and how does it happen that this push is exactly right to produce the same current in each segment? What’s more, given that the charges in a typical wire move (literally) at a snail’s pace (see Prob. 5.21), why doesn’t it take half an hour for the current to reach the light bulb? How do all the charges know to start moving at the same instant? 305 7.1 Electromotive Force Fig. 7.7 Iin Iout E E \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004\u0004 Fig. 7.8 Answer: If the current were not the same all the way around (for instance, during the first split second after the switch is closed), then charge would be piling up somewhere, and – here’s the crucial point – the electric field of this accumulating charge is in such a direction as to even out the flow. Suppose, for instance, that the current into the bend in Fig. 7.8 is greater than the current out. Then charge piles up at the “knee,” and this produces a field aiming away from the kink. 3 This field opposes the current flowing in (slowing it down) and promotes the current flowing out (speeding it up) until these currents are equal, at which point there is no further accumulation of charge, and equilibrium is established. It’s a beautiful system, automatically self-correcting to keep the current uniform, and it does it all so quickly that, in practice, you can safely assume the current is the same all around the circuit, even in systems that oscillate at radio frequencies. There are really two forces involved in driving charge around a circuit: the source, qf s, which is ordinarily confined to one portion of the loop (a bat- tery, say), and an electrostatic force, qE, which serves to smooth out the flow and communicate the influence of the source to distant parts of the circuit: f = f s + E. (7.8) The physical agency responsible for f s can be many different things: in a battery it’s a chemical force; in a piezoelectric crystal, mechanical pressure is converted into an electrical impulse; in a thermocouple it’s a temperature gradient that does the job; in a photoelectric cell it’s light; and in a Van de Graaff generator the electrons are literally loaded onto a conveyer belt and swept along. Whatever the mechanism, its net effect is determined by the line integral of f around the circuit: E ≡ ∮ f · dl = ∮ f s · dl. (7.9) (Because ∮ E · dl = 0 for electrostatic fields, it doesn’t matter whether you use f or f s.) The quantity E is called the electromotive force,or emf,of the circuit. It’s a lousy term, since this is not a force at all – it’s the integral of a force per unit charge. Some people prefer the word electromotance, but emf is so established that I think we’d better stick with it. 3 The amount of charge involved is surprisingly small – see W. G. V. Rosser, Am. J. Phys. 38, 265 (1970); nevertheless, the resulting field can be detected experimentally – see R. Jacobs, A. de Salazar, and A. Nassar, Am.J.Phys. 78, 1432 (2010). 306 7 Electrodynamics Within an ideal source of emf (a resistanceless battery,4 for instance), the net force on the charges is zero (Eq. 7.1 with σ = ∞), so E = −f s.The potential difference between the terminals (a and b) is therefore V = − ∫ b a E · dl = ∫ b a f s · dl = ∮ f s · dl = E (7.10) (we can extend the integral to the entire loop because f s = 0 outside the source). The function of a battery, then, is to establish and maintain a voltage difference equal to the electromotive force (a 6 V battery, for example, holds the positive terminal 6 V above the negative terminal). The resulting electrostatic field drives current around the rest of the circuit (notice, however, that inside the battery f s drives current in the direction opposite to E). 5 Because it’s the line integral of f s, E can be interpreted as the work done per unit charge, by the source – indeed, in some books electromotive force is defined this way. However, as you’ll see in the next section, there is some subtlety involved in this interpretation, so I prefer Eq. 7.9. Problem 7.5. Abatteryof emf E and internal resistance r is hooked up to a variable “load” resistance, R. If you want to deliver the maximum possible power to the load, what resistance R should you choose? (You can’t change E and r,ofcourse.) +σ E Rh Fig. 7.9 Problem 7.6. A rectangular loop of wire is situated so that one end (height h) is between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 7.9), oriented parallel to the field E. The other end is way outside, where the field is essentially zero. What is the emf in this loop? If the total resistance is R, what current flows? Explain. [Warning: This is a trick question, so be careful; if you have invented a perpetual motion machine, there’s probably something wrong with it.] 7.1.3 Motional Emf In the last section, I listed several possible sources of electromotive force, batteries being the most familiar. But I did not mention the commonest one 4 Real batteries have a certain internal resistance, r, and the potential difference between their terminals is E − Ir, when a current I is flowing. For an illuminating discussion of how batteries work, see D. Roberts, Am.J.Phys. 51, 829 (1983). 5 Current in an electric circuit is somewhat analogous to the flow of water in a closed system of pipes, with gravity playing the role of the electrostatic field, and a pump (lifting the water up against gravity) in the role of the battery. In this story, height is analogous to voltage. 307 7.1 Electromotive Force Rh c d vx b a Fig. 7.10 of all: the generator. Generators exploit motional emfs,whicharise when you move a wire through a magnetic field. Figure 7.10 suggests a primitive model for a generator. In the shaded region there is a uniform magnetic field B, pointing into the page, and the resistor R represents whatever it is (maybe a light bulb or a toaster) we’re trying to drive current through. If the entire loop is pulled to the right with speed v, the mobile charges in segment ab experience a magnetic force whose vertical component qvB drives current around the loop, in the clockwise direction. The emf is E = ∮ f mag · dl = vBh, (7.11) where h is the width of the loop. (The horizontal segments bc and ad contribute nothing, since the force there is perpendicular to the wire.) Notice that the integral you perform to calculate E (Eq. 7.9 or 7.11)is carried out at one instant of time – take a “snapshot” of the loop, if you like, and work from that. Thus dl, for the segment ab in Fig. 7.10, points straight up, even though the loop is moving to the right. You can’t quarrel with this – it’s simply the way emf is defined – but it is important to be clear about it. In particular, although the magnetic force is responsible for establishing the emf, it is not doing any work – magnetic forces never do work. Who, then, is supplying the energy that heats the resistor? Answer: The person who’s pulling on the loop, of course. But this is subtle, so listen closely. With the current flowing, the free charges in segment ab have a vertical velocity (call it u) in addition to the horizontal velocity v they inherit from the motion of the loop. Accordingly, the magnetic force has a component quB to the left. To counteract this, the person pulling on the wire must exert a force per unit charge fpull = uB to the right (Fig. 7.11). This force is transmitted to the charge by the structure of the wire. Meanwhile, the particle is actually moving in the direction of the resul- tant velocity w, and the distance it goes is (h/ cos θ). The work done per unit charge (by the person pulling on the loop, on a charge as it ascends the “vertical” segment) is therefore ∫ f pull · dl = (uB) ( h cos θ ) sin θ = vBh = E 308 7 Electrodynamics θ θ fmag fpull u v w uB v Fig. 7.11 b (a) Integration path for computing (follow the wire at one instant of time). (b) Integration path for calculating work done (follow the charge around the loop). daa h/cos a\u0007 d h a\u0007 c b c Fig. 7.12 (sin θ coming from the dot product). As it turns out, then, the work done per unit charge is exactly equal to the emf, though the integrals are taken along entirely different paths (Fig. 7.12), and completely different forces are involved. To calculate the emf, you integrate around the loop at one instant, but to calculate the work done you follow a charge in its journey around the loop; f pull contributes nothing to the emf, because it is perpendicular to the wire, whereas f mag contributes nothing to work because it is perpendicular to the net motion of the charge. 6 There is a particularly nice way of expressing the emf generated in a moving loop. Let Φ be the flux of B through the loop: Φ ≡ ∫ B · da. (7.12) For the rectangular loop in Fig. 7.10, Φ = Bhx. As the loop moves, the flux decreases: dΦ dt = Bh dx dt = −Bhv. (The minus sign accounts for the fact that dx/dt is negative.) But this is precisely the emf (Eq. 7.11); the emf generated in the loop is minus the rate of change of flux through the loop: 6 For further discussion, see E. P. Mosca, Am.J.Phys. 42, 295 (1974). 309 7.1 Electromotive Force Loop at time t Loop at time (t + dt) Ribbon P P P\u0007 P\u0007 Surface θ dl v dt Enlargement of da da Fig. 7.13 E = − dΦ dt . (7.13) This is the flux rule for motional emf. Apart from its delightful simplicity, the flux rule has the virtue of applying to nonrectangular loops moving in arbitrary directions through nonuniform magnetic fields; in fact, the loop need not even maintain a fixed shape. Proof. Figure 7.13 shows a loop of wire at time t, and also a short time dt later. Suppose we compute the flux at time t, using surface S, and the flux at time t + dt, using the surface consisting of S plus the “ribbon” that connects the new position of the loop to the old. The change in flux, then, is dΦ = Φ(t + dt) − Φ(t) = Φribbon = ∫ ribbon B · da. Focus your attention on point P: in time dt,itmoves to P′.Let v be the velocity of the wire,and u the velocity of a charge down the wire; w = v + u is the resultant velocity of a charge at P. The infinitesimal element of area on the ribbon can be written as da = (v × dl) dt (see inset in Fig. 7.13). Therefore dΦ dt = ∮ B · (v × dl). Since w = (v+u) and u is parallel to dl, we can just as well write this as dΦ dt = ∮ B · (w × dl). 310 7 Electrodynamics b a B (into page) A Fig. 7.14 Now, the scalar triple product can be rewritten: B · (w × dl) = −(w × B) · dl, so dΦ dt = − ∮ (w × B) · dl. But (w × B) is the magnetic force per unit charge, f mag,so dΦ dt = − ∮ f mag · dl, and the integral of f mag is the emf: E = − dΦ dt . □ There is a sign ambiguity in the definition of emf (Eq. 7.9): Which way around the loop are you supposed to integrate? There is a compensating ambiguity in the definition of flux (Eq. 7.12): Which is the positive direction for da? In applying the flux rule, sign consistency is governed (as always) by your right hand: if your fingers define the positive direction around the loop, then your thumb indicates the direction of da. Should the emf come out negative, it means the current will flow in the negative direction around the circuit. The flux rule is a nifty shortcut for calculating motional emfs. It does not contain any new physics – just the Lorentz force law. But it can lead to error or ambiguity if you’re not careful. The flux rule assumes you have a single wire loop – it can move, rotate, stretch, or distort (continuously), but beware of switches, sliding contacts, or extended conductors allowing a variety of current paths. A standard “flux rule paradox” involves the circuit in Fig. 7.14. When the switch is thrown (from a to b) the flux through the circuit doubles, but there’s no motional emf (no conductor moving through a magnetic field), and the ammeter (A) records no current. Example 7.4. A metal disk of radius a rotates with angular velocity ω about a vertical axis, through a uniform field B, pointing up. A circuit is made by connecting one end of a resistor to the axle and the other end to a sliding contact, which touches the outer edge of the disk (Fig. 7.15). Find the current in the resistor. 311 7.1 Electromotive Force I (Sliding contact) BB R Fig. 7.15 Solution. The speed of a point on the disk at a distance s from the axis is v = ωs, so the force per unit charge is f mag = v × B = ωsBˆs.The emf is therefore E = ∫ a 0 fmag ds = ωB ∫ a 0 sds = ωBa 2 2 , and the current is I = E R = ωBa 2 2R . Example 7.4 (the Faraday disk,or Faraday dynamo) involves a motional emf that you can’t calculate (at least, not directly) from the flux rule. The flux rule assumes the current flows along a well-defined path, whereas in this example the current spreads out over the whole disk. It’s not even clear what the “flux through the circuit” would mean in this context. Even more tricky is the case of eddy currents. Take a chunk of aluminum (say), and shake it around in a nonuniform magnetic field. Currents will be generated in the material, and you will feel a kind of “viscous drag” – as though you were pulling the block through molasses (this is the force I called f pull in the discussion of motional emf). Eddy currents are notoriously difficult to calculate, 7 but easy and dramatic to demonstrate. You may have witnessed the classic experiment in which an aluminum disk mounted as a (b)(a) Fig. 7.16 7 See, for example, W. M. Saslow, Am.J.Phys. 60, 693 (1992). 312 7 Electrodynamics pendulum on a horizontal axis swings down and passes between the poles of a magnet (Fig. 7.16a). When it enters the field region it suddenly slows way down. To confirm that eddy currents are responsible, one repeats the demonstration using a disk that has many slots cut in it, to prevent the flow of large-scale currents (Fig. 7.16b). This time the disk swings freely, unimpeded by the field. Example 7.5.8 There are precious few eddy current problems that can be treated analytically. Here’s a rare example, solved by Hertz (at the age of 23) in 1880. Imagine a uniform, electrically neutral, spherical shell, of inner radius R1, outer radius R2, and conductivity σ, centered at the origin and spinning with constant angular velocity ωωω,inthe presence of a uniform magnetic field B. 9 Find the eddy currents in the shell, in the steady state (fields, charges, currents all constant in time), if (a) ωωω and B are in the same direction and (b) they are perpendicular. Solution. In electrostatics the charge density in a conductor is zero (any excess charge goes to the surface), and this is still true for steady currents in conductors at rest, as we found in Eq. 7.5. But for a conductor moving through a magnetic field we cannot ignore the velocity term in Eq. 7.2. Indeed, taking the divergence, and invoking Gauss’s law and the continuity equation, ∇ · J = σ[∇ · E + ∇ · (v × B)] = σ [ 1 ϵ0 ρ + ∇ · (v × B)] = − ∂ρ ∂t . In the steady state ρ is constant, and we are left with ρ = −ϵ0∇ · (v × B). (7.14) (a) We might as well choose axes such that B = Bˆz and ωωω = ωˆz.For any point in a rigid rotating object, v = ωωω × r, so, using the BAC–CAB rule, v × B = (ωωω × r) × B = r(B · ωωω) − ωωω(B · r) = ωB(r − zˆz) = ωB(xˆx + yˆy), (7.15) and therefore ρ = −2ϵ0ωB. (7.16) (There will be compensating charge at the two surfaces, of course.) The electric potential satisfies Poisson’s equation ∇ 2V = − 1 ϵ0 ρ = 2ωB (R1 < r < R2) (7.17) 8 This example can be skipped without loss of continuity. For details and practical applica- tions see M. A. Nurge et al., Am.J.Phys. 85, 596 (2017). 9 Assume that any magnetic fields produced by the eddy currents themselves are negligible – or that they are included in B. 313 7.1 Electromotive Force and the radial current vanishes at the boundaries (otherwise charge would be leaking off into space): Jr = σ[E + v × B] · ˆr = 0 (at r = R1 and R2). (7.18) Thus Er = −ωB(xˆx + yˆy) · ˆr = − ωB r (x2 + y 2) = −ωBr sin2 θ (7.19) at each surface: ∂V ∂r |||R1 = ωBR1 sin2 θ, ∂V ∂r |||R2 = ωBR2 sin2 θ. (7.20) Having specified the charge density (Eq. 7.16) and the normal deriva- tive of V on the boundaries (Eq. 7.20), the field in the shell is uniquely determined (Prob. 3.5). In fact, it’s easy to guess the potential: V (r, θ) = ωB 2 r 2 sin2 θ + K = ωB 2 (x2 + y 2) + K (7.21) (for some constant K), and the field is E = −∇V = −ωB(xˆx + yˆy) = −v × B (7.22) (Eq. 7.15). As it turns out, then, the electric force exactly cancels the magnetic force; there is no eddy current in this configuration, 10 J = 0. (b) This time we’ll take ωωω = ωˆx and B = Bˆy. Then v × B = r(B · ωωω) − ωωω(B · r) = −ωByˆx, which is divergenceless, so the charge density vanishes (Eq. 7.14): ρ = 0 (there may still be induced surface charges). Laplace’s equation holds within the shell, ∇2V = 0, and Eq. 7.19 becomes Er = −(v × B) · ˆr = ωBy(ˆx · ˆr) = ωBr sin2 θ sin φ cos φ at each boundary: ∂V ∂r |||R1 = −ωBR1 sin2 θ sin φ cos φ, ∂V ∂r |||R2 = −ωBR2 sin2 θ sin φ cos φ. The solution is V (r, θ, φ) = − ωB 2 r 2 sin2 θ sin φ cos φ+K = − ωB 2 xy+K (R1 < r < R2), 10 There is a convection current, since ρ (and the surface charges) are dragged around by the spinning of the shell, but (as you can check for yourself) the ratio Jconv/Jcond is typically of the order of ϵ0ω/σ, which is utterly negligible for (say) aluminum at 100 rpm. 314 7 Electrodynamics and the electric field is E = −∇V = ωB 2 (yˆx + xˆy). The eddy current is J = σ[E + (v × B)] = ωBσ 2 (−yˆx + xˆy) = ωBσ 2 r sin θ ˆφ. Remarkably, this is just what you would get if the shell had been a nonconductor carrying a uniform charge density ρ = Bσ/2 and spin- ning with angular velocity ω about the z-axis. That’s right:the z-axis! Incidentally, for ωωω and B in arbitrary orientations the formula is J = − σ 2 [r × (ωωω × B)]. Problem 7.7. A metal bar of mass m slides frictionlessly on two parallel conducting rails a distance l apart (Fig. 7.17). A resistor R is connected across the rails, and a uniform magnetic field B, pointing into the page, fills the entire region. (a) If the bar moves to the right at speed v, what is the current in the resistor? In what direction does it flow? (b) What is the magnetic force on the bar? In what direction? (c) If the bar starts out with speed v0 at time t = 0, and is left to slide, what is its speed at a later time t? (d) The initial kinetic energy of the bar was, of course, 1 2 mv02. Check that the energy delivered to the resistor is exactly 1 2 mv02. R l m v Fig. 7.17 Problem 7.8. A square loop of wire (side length a) lies on a table, a distance s from a very long straight wire, which carries a current I, as shown in Fig. 7.18. (a) Find the flux of B through the loop. (b) If someone now pulls the loop directly away from the wire, at speed v,whatemfis generated? In what direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) does the current flow? (c) What if the loop is pulled to the right at speed v? 315 7.1 Electromotive Force s a a I Fig. 7.18 Problem 7.9. An infinite number of different surfaces can be fit to a given boundary line, and yet, in defining the magnetic flux through a loop, Φ = ∫ B·da, I never specified the particular surface to be used. Justify this apparent oversight. Problem 7.10. A square loop (side length a) is mounted on a vertical shaft and rotated at angular velocity ω (Fig. 7.19). A uniform magnetic field B points to the right. Find E(t) for this alternating current generator. Problem 7.11. A square loop is cut out of a thick sheet of aluminum. It is then placed so that the top portion is in a uniform magnetic field B, and is allowed to fall under gravity (Fig. 7.20). (In the diagram, shading indicates the field region; B points into the page.) If the magnetic field is 1 T (a pretty standard laboratory field), find the terminal velocity of the loop (in m/s). Find the velocity of the loop as a function of time. How long does it take (in seconds) to reach, say, 90 percent of the terminal velocity? What would happen if you cut a tiny slit in the ring, breaking the circuit? [Note: The dimensions of the loop cancel out; determine the actual numbers,inthe units indicated.] Problem 7.12. Calculate the net magnetic torque on the eddy current in Ex. 7.5b. This torque will act as a brake on the rotation. What is the time constant for the (exponential) damping? Assume that the angular velocity lost in a given rotation is a small fraction of the total. Find the actual number, for aluminum (mass density 2.7 × 103 kg/m3) in the Earth’s magnetic field. B a a ω Fig. 7.19 Fig. 7.20 316 7 Electrodynamics 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 7.2.1 Faraday’s Law In 1831, Michael Faraday reported on a series of experiments, including three that (with some violence to history) can be characterized as follows: Experiment 1 He pulled a loop of wire to the right through a magnetic field (Fig. 7.21a). A current flowed in the loop. Experiment 2 He moved the magnet to the left, holding the loop still (Fig. 7.21b). Again, a current flowed in the loop. Experiment 3 With both the loop and the magnet at rest (Fig. 7.21c), he changed the strength of the field (he used an electromagnet, and varied the current in the coil). Once again, current flowed in the loop. The first experiment, of course, is a straightforward case of motional emf; according to the flux rule, E = − dΦ dt . I don’t think it will surprise you to learn that exactly the same emf arises in Experiment 2 – all that really matters is the relative motion of the magnet and the loop. Indeed, in the light of special relativity it has to be so. But Faraday knew nothing of relativity, and in classical electrodynamics this simple reciprocity is a remarkable coincidence. For if the loop moves, it’s a magnetic force that sets up the emf, but if the loop is stationary, the force cannot be magnetic – stationary charges experience no magnetic forces. In that case, what is responsible? What sort of field exerts a force on charges at rest? Well, electric fields do, of course, but there doesn’t seem to be any electric field in sight. Faraday had an ingenious inspiration: a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. B (in) II vv B (in) I B (c)(b)(a) Changing magnetic field Fig. 7.21 317 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction It is this induced11 electric field that accounts for the emf in Experiment 2. 12 Indeed, if (as Faraday found empirically) the emf is again equal to the rate of change of the flux, E = ∮ E · dl = − dΦ dt , (7.23) then E is related to the change in B by the equation ∮ E · dl = − ∫ ∂B ∂t · da. (7.24) This is Faraday’s law, in integral form. We can convert it to differential form by applying Stokes’ theorem (see footnote to Eq. 2.14): ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t . (7.25) Note that Faraday’s law reduces to the old rule ∮ E·dl = 0 (or, in differential form, ∇ × E = 0) in the static case (constant B) as, of course, it should. In Experiment 3, the magnetic field changes for entirely different reasons, but according to Faraday’s law an electric field will again be induced, giving rise to an emf −dΦ/dt. Indeed, one can subsume all three cases (and for that matter any combination of them) into a kind of universal flux rule: Whenever (and for whatever reason) the magnetic flux through a loop changes, an emf E = − dΦ dt (7.26) will appear in the loop. Many people call this “Faraday’s law.” 13 Maybe I’m overly fastidious, but I find this confusing. There are really two totally different mechanisms underlying Eq. 7.26, and to identify them both as “Faraday’s law” is a little like saying that because identical twins look alike we ought to call them by the same name. In Faraday’s first experiment it’s the Lorentz force law at work; the emf is magnetic. But in the other two it’s an electric field (induced by the changing magnetic field) that does the job. Viewed in this 11 “Induce” is a subtle and slippery verb. It carries a faint odor of causation (“produce” would make this explicit) without quite committing itself. There is a sterile ongoing debate in the literature as to whether a changing magnetic field should be regarded as an independent “source” of electric fields (along with electric charge) – after all, the magnetic field itself is due to electric currents. It’s like asking whether the postman is the “source” of my mail. Well, sure – he delivered it to my door. On the other hand, Grandma wrote the letter. Ultimately, ρ and J are the sources of all electromagnetic fields, and a changing magnetic field merely delivers electromagnetic news from currents somewhere else. But it is often convenient to think of a changing magnetic field “producing” an electric field, and it won’t hurt you as long as you understand that this is the condensed version of a more complicated story. For a nice discussion, see S. E. Hill, Phys. Teach. 48, 410 (2010). 12 You might argue that the magnetic field in Experiment 2 is not really changing –just moving. Butif you sitata fixed location, the field you experience changes as the magnet passes by. 13 Electrical engineers like to say that the emf is generated by the “cutting” of magnetic field lines. 318 7 Electrodynamics light, it is quite astonishing that all three processes yield the same formula for the emf. In fact, it was precisely this “coincidence” that led Einstein to the special theory of relativity – he sought a deeper understanding of what is, in classical electrodynamics, a peculiar accident. But that’s a story for Chapter 12. In the meantime, I shall reserve the term “Faraday’s law” for electric fields induced by changing magnetic fields, and I do not regard Experiment 1 as an instance of Faraday’s law. Example 7.6. A long cylindrical magnet of length L and radius a carries a uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. It passes at constant velocity v through a circular wire ring of slightly larger diameter (Fig. 7.22). Graph the emf induced in the ring, as a function of time. L a M v Fig. 7.22 L/v t μ0Mπa2 \u000b t (b)(a) Fig. 7.23 Solution. The magnetic field is the same as that of a long solenoid with surface current Kb = M ˆφ. So the field inside is B = μ0M, except near the ends, where it starts to spread out. The flux through the ring is zero when the magnet is far away; it builds up to a maximum of μ0Mπa 2 as the leading end passes through; and it drops back to zero as the trailing end emerges (Fig. 7.23a). The emf is (minus) the derivative of Φ with respect to time, so it consists of two spikes, as shown in Fig. 7.23b. Keeping track of the signs in Faraday’s law can be a real headache. For instance, in Ex. 7.6 we would like to know which way around the ring the induced current flows. In principle, the right-hand rule does the job (we called Φ positive to the left, in Fig. 7.22, so the positive direction for current in the ring is counterclockwise, as viewed from the left; since the first spike in Fig. 7.23b is negative, the first current pulse flows clockwise, and the second 319 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction counterclockwise). But there’s a handy rule, called Lenz’s law, whose sole purpose is to help you get the directions right:14 nature abhors a change in flux. The induced current will flow in such a direction that the flux it produces tends to cancel the change. (As the front end of the magnet in Ex. 7.6 enters the ring, the flux increases, so the current in the ring must generate a field to the right – it therefore flows clockwise.) Notice that it is the change in flux, not the flux itself, that nature abhors (when the tail end of the magnet exits the ring, the flux drops, so the induced current flows counterclockwise,inan effort to restore it). Faraday induction is a kind of “inertial” phenomenon: A conducting loop “likes” to maintain a constant flux through it; if you try to change the flux, the loop responds by sending a current around in such a direction as to frustrate your efforts. (It doesn’t succeed completely; the flux produced by the induced current is typically only a tiny fraction of the original. All Lenz’s law tells you is the direction of the flow.) Example 7.7. (The “jumping ring” demonstration.) If you wind a solenoidal coil around an iron core (the iron is there to beef up the magnetic field), place a metal ring on top, and plug it in, the ring will jump several feet in the air (Fig. 7.24). Why? B Ring Solenoid Fig. 7.24 Solution. Before you turned on the current, the flux through the ring was zero. Afterward a flux appeared (upward, in the diagram), and the emf generated in the ring led to a current (in the ring) which, according to Lenz’s law, was in such a direction that its field tended to cancel this new flux. This means that the current in the loop is opposite to the current in the solenoid. And opposite currents repel, so the ring flies off.15 14 Lenz’s law applies to motional emfs, too, but for them it is usually easier to get the direction of the current from the Lorentz force law. 15 For further discussion of the jumping ring (and the related “floating ring”), see C. S. Schneider and J. P. Ertel, Am.J.Phys. 66, 686 (1998); P. J. H. Tjossem and E. C. Brost, Am.J.Phys. 79, 353 (2011). 320 7 Electrodynamics Problem 7.13. A long solenoid, of radius a, is driven by an alternating current, so that the field inside is sinusoidal: B(t) = B0 cos(ωt)ˆz. A circular loop of wire, of radius a/2 and resistance R, is placed inside the solenoid, and coaxial with it. Find the current induced in the loop, as a function of time. Problem 7.14. A square loop of wire, with sides of length a, lies in the first quadrant of the xy plane, with one corner at the origin. In this region, there is a nonuniform time-dependent magnetic field B(y, t) = ky3t2ˆz (where k is a constant). Find the emf induced in the loop. Problem 7.15. As a lecture demonstration a short cylindrical bar magnet is dropped down a vertical aluminum pipe of slightly larger diameter, about 2 m long. It takes several seconds to emerge at the bottom, whereas an otherwise identical piece of unmagnetized iron makes the trip in a fraction of a second. Explain why the magnet falls more slowly.16 7.2.2 The Induced Electric Field Faraday’s law generalizes the electrostatic rule ∇ × E = 0 to the time- dependent régime. The divergence of E is still given by Gauss’s law (∇ · E = ρ/ϵ0).If E is a pure Faraday field (due exclusively to a changing B, with ρ = 0), then ∇ · E = 0, ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t . This is mathematically identical to magnetostatics, ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = μ0J. Conclusion: Faraday-induced electric fields are determined by −(∂B/∂t) in exactly the same way as magnetostatic fields are determined by μ0J.The analog to Biot–Savart is 17 is E = − 1 4π ∫ (∂B/∂t) × ˆ 2 dτ = − 1 4π ∂ ∂t ∫ B × ˆ 2 dτ, (7.27) and if symmetry permits, we can use all the tricks associated with Ampère’s law in integral form (∮ B·dl = μ0Ienc), only now it’s Faraday’s law in integral form: ∮ E · dl = − dΦ dt . (7.28) The rate of change of (magnetic) flux through the Ampèrian loop plays the role formerly assigned to μ0Ienc. 16 For a discussion of this amazing demonstration see K. D. Hahn et al., Am. J. Phys. 66, 1066 (1998); G. Donoso, C. L. Ladera, and P. Martin, Am.J.Phys. 79, 193 (2011). 17 Magnetostatics holds only for time-independent currents, but there is no such restriction on ∂B/∂t. 321 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction Example 7.8. A uniform magnetic field B(t), pointing straight up, fills the shaded circular region of Fig. 7.25.If B is changing with time, what is the induced electric field? Solution. E points in the azimuthal direction, just like the magnetic field inside a long straight wire carrying a uniform current density. Draw an Ampèrian loop of radius s, and apply Faraday’s law: ∮ E · dl = E(2πs) = − dΦ dt = − d dt (πs 2B(t)) = −πs 2 dB dt . Therefore, E = − s 2 dB dt ˆφ. If B is increasing, E runs clockwise, as viewed from above. B(t) Amperian loop` s Fig. 7.25 B0 E Rotation direction dl b a λ Fig. 7.26 Example 7.9. A line charge λ is glued onto the rim of a wheel of radius b, which is then suspended horizontally, as shown in Fig. 7.26, so that it is free to rotate (the spokes are made of some nonconducting material – wood, maybe). In the central region, out to radius a, there is a uniform magnetic field B0, pointing up. Now someone turns the field off. What happens? Solution. The changing magnetic field will induce an electric field, curling around the axis of the wheel. This electric field exerts a force on the charges at the rim, and the wheel starts to turn. According to Lenz’s law, it will rotate in such a direction that its field tends to restore the upward flux. The motion, then, is counterclockwise, as viewed from above. Faraday’s law, applied to the loop at radius b,says ∮ E · dl = E(2πb) = − dΦ dt = −πa 2 dB dt ,or E = − a 2 2b dB dt ˆφ. The torque on a segment of length dl is (r × F), or bλEdl. The total torque on the wheel is therefore N = bλ (− a 2 2b dB dt ) ∮ dl = −bλπa 2 dB dt , 322 7 Electrodynamics and the angular momentum imparted to the wheel is ∫ Ndt = −λπa2b ∫ 0 B0 dB = λπa 2bB0. It doesn’t matter how quickly or slowly you turn off the field; the resulting angular velocity of the wheel is the same regardless. (If you find yourself wondering where the angular momentum came from, you’re getting ahead of the story! Wait for the next chapter.) Note that it’s the electric field that did the rotating. To convince you of this, I deliberately set things up so that the magnetic field is zero at the location of the charge. The experimenters may tell you they never put in any electric field – all they did was switch off the magnetic field. But when they did that, an electric field automatically appeared, and it’s this electric field that turned the wheel. I must warn you, now, of a small fraud that tarnishes many applications of Faraday’s law: electromagnetic induction, of course, occurs only when the magnetic fields are changing, and yet we would like to use the apparatus of magnetostatics (Ampère’s law, the Biot–Savart law, and the rest) to calculate those magnetic fields. Technically, any result derived in this way is only approximately correct. But in practice the error is usually negligible, unless the field fluctuates extremely rapidly, or you are interested in points very far from the source. Even the case of a wire snipped by a pair of scissors (Prob. 7.19)is static enough for Ampère’s law to apply. This régime, in which magnetostatic rules can be used to calculate the magnetic field on the right-hand side of Faraday’s law, is called quasistatic. Generally speaking, it is only when we come to electromagnetic waves and radiation that we must worry seriously about the breakdown of magnetostatics itself. Example 7.10. An infinitely long straight wire carries a slowly varying current I (t). Determine the induced electric field, as a function of the distance s from the wire.18 Solution. In the quasistatic approximation, the magnetic field is (μ0I/2πs), and it circles around the wire. Like the B-field of a solenoid, E here runs parallel to the axis. For the rectangular “Ampèrian loop” in Fig. 7.27, Faraday’s law gives 18 This example is artificial, and not just in the obvious sense of involving infinite wires, but in a more subtle respect. It assumes that the current is the same (at any given instant) all the way down the line. This is a safe assumption for the short wires in typical electric circuits, but not for long wires (transmission lines), unless you supply a distributed and synchronized driving mechanism. But never mind – the problem doesn’t enquire how you would produce such a current; it only asks what fields would result if you did. Variations on this problem are discussed by M. A. Heald, Am.J.Phys. 54, 1142 (1986). 323 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction l I s0 s Amperian loop` Fig. 7.27 ∮ E · dl = E(s0)l − E(s)l = − d dt ∫ B · da = − μ0l 2π dI dt ∫ s s0 1 s′ ds′ = − μ0l 2π dI dt (ln s − ln s0). Thus E(s) = [ μ0 2π dI dt ln s + K ]ˆz, (7.29) where K is a constant (that is to say, it is independent of s – it might still be a function of t). The actual value of K depends on the whole history of the function I (t) – we’ll see some examples in Chapter 10. Equation 7.29 has the peculiar implication that E blows up as s goes to infinity. That can’t be true. … What’s gone wrong? Answer: We have overstepped the limits of the quasistatic approximation. As we shall see in Chapter 9, electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light, and at large distances B depends not on the current now, but on the current as it was at some earlier time (indeed, a whole range of earlier times, since different points on the wire are different distances away). If τ is the time it takes I to change substantially, then the quasistatic approximation should hold only for s ≪ cτ, (7.30) and hence Eq. 7.29 simply does not apply, at extremely large s. Problem 7.16. A long solenoid with radius a and n turns per unit length carries a time- dependent current I (t) in the ˆφ direction. Find the electric field (magnitude and direction) at a distance s from the axis (both inside and outside the solenoid), in the quasistatic approximation. Problem 7.17. An alternating current I = I0 cos(ωt) flows down a long straight wire, and returns along a coaxial conducting tube of radius a. (a) In what direction does the induced electric field point (radial, circumferential, or longitudinal)? (b) Assuming that the field goes to zero as s →∞,find E(s, t).19 19 This is not at all the way electric fields actually behave in coaxial cables, for reasons suggested in footnote . See Section 9.5.3,orJ.G.Cherveniak, Am. J. Phys. 54, 946 (1986), for a more realistic treatment. 324 7 Electrodynamics Problem 7.18. A long solenoid of radius a,carrying n turns per unit length, is looped by a wire with resistance R, as shown in Fig. 7.28. R Fig. 7.28 (a) If the current in the solenoid is increasing at a constant rate (dI/dt = k), what current flows in the loop, and which way (left or right) does it pass through the resistor? (b) If the current I in the solenoid is constant but the solenoid is pulled out of the loop (toward the left, to a place far from the loop), what total charge passes through the resistor? Problem 7.19. A square loop, side a, resistance R, lies a distance s from an infinite straight wire that carries current I (Fig. 7.29). Now someone cuts the wire, so I drops to zero. In what direction does the induced current in the square loop flow, and what total charge passes a given point in the loop during the time this current flows? If you don’t like the scissors model, turn the current down gradually: I (t) = ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪ ⎩ (1 − αt)I for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/α, 0 for t > 1/α. a a s I Fig. 7.29 Problem 7.20. A toroidal coil has a rectangular cross section, with inner radius a,outer radius a + w, and height h. It carries a total of N tightly wound turns, and the current is increasing at a constant rate (dI/dt = k). If w and h are both much less than a, find the electric field at apoint z above the center of the toroid. [Hint: Exploit the analogy between Faraday fields and magnetostatic fields, and refer to Ex. 5.6.] Problem 7.21. Where is ∂B/∂t nonzero, in Fig. 7.21b? Exploit the analogy between Faraday’s law and Ampère’s law to sketch (qualitatively) the electric field. [For a quantitative model, see Prob. 7.46.] 325 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction Problem 7.22. Imagine a uniform magnetic field, pointing in the z direction and filling all space (B = B0ˆz). A positive charge is at rest, at the origin. Now somebody turns off the magnetic field, thereby inducing an electric field. In what direction does the charge move?20 7.2.3 Inductance Suppose you have two loops of wire, at rest (Fig. 7.30). If you run a steady current I1 around loop 1, it produces a magnetic field B1. Some of the field lines pass through loop 2; let Φ2 be the flux of B1 through 2. You might have a tough time actually calculating B1, but a glance at the Biot–Savart law, B1 = μ0 4π I1 ∮ dl1 × ˆ 2 , reveals one significant fact about this field: it is proportional to the current I1. Therefore, so too is the flux through loop 2: Φ2 = ∫ B1 · da2. Thus Φ2 = M21I1, (7.31) where M21 is the constant of proportionality; it is known as the mutual inductance of the two loops. There is a cute formula for the mutual inductance, which you can derive by expressing the flux in terms of the vector potential, and invoking Stokes’ theorem: Φ2 = ∫ B1 · da2 = ∫ (∇ × A1) · da2 = ∮ A1 · dl2. Now, according to Eq. 5.66, A1 = μ0I1 4π ∮ dl1 , Loop 2 Loop 1 B1 B1 I1 B1 Fig. 7.30 Loop 2 Loop 1 dl2 dl1 Fig. 7.31 20 This paradox was suggested by Tom Colbert. Refer to Prob. 2.56. 326 7 Electrodynamics and hence Φ2 = μ0I1 4π ∮ (∮ dl1 ) · dl2. Evidently, M21 = μ0 4π ∮∮ dl1 · dl2 . (7.32) This is the Neumann formula; it involves a double line integral – one integration around loop 1, the other around loop 2 (Fig. 7.31). It’s not very useful for practical calculations, but it does reveal two important things about mutual inductance: (1) M21 is a purely geometrical quantity, having to do with the sizes, shapes, and relative positions of the two loops. (2) The integral in Eq. 7.32 is unchanged if we switch the roles of loops 1 and 2; it follows that M21 = M12. (7.33) This is an astonishing conclusion: Whatever the shapes and positions of the loops, the flux through 2 when we run a current I around 1 is identical to the flux through 1 when we send the same current I around 2. We may as well drop the subscripts and call them both M. Example 7.11. A short solenoid (length l and radius a, with n1 turns per unit length) lies on the axis of a very long solenoid (radius b, n2 turns per unit length) as shown in Fig. 7.32. Current I flows in the short solenoid. What is the flux through the long solenoid? l b a Fig. 7.32 Solution. Since the inner solenoid is short, it has a very complicated field; moreover, it puts a different flux through each turn of the outer solenoid. It would be a miserable task to compute the total flux this way. However, if we exploit the equality of the mutual inductances, the problem becomes very easy. Just look at the reverse situation: run the current I through the outer solenoid, and calculate the flux through the inner one. The field inside the long solenoid is constant: B = μ0n2I 327 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction (Eq. 5.59), so the flux through a single loop of the short solenoid is Bπa 2 = μ0n2I πa 2. There are n1l turns in all, so the total flux through the inner solenoid is Φ = μ0πa 2n1n2lI. This is also the flux a current I in the short solenoid would put through the long one, which is what we set out to find. Incidentally, the mutual inductance, in this case, is M = μ0πa 2n1n2l. Suppose, now, that you vary the current in loop 1. The flux through loop 2 will vary accordingly, and Faraday’s law says this changing flux will induce an emf in loop 2: E2 = − dΦ2 dt = −M dI1 dt . (7.34) (In quoting Eq. 7.31 – which was based on the Biot–Savart law – I am tacitly assuming that the currents change slowly enough for the system to be considered quasistatic.) What a remarkable thing: every time you change the current in loop 1, an induced current flows in loop 2 – even though there are no wires connecting them! Come to think of it, a changing current not only induces an emf in any nearby loops, it also induces an emf in the source loop itself (Fig 7.33). Once again, the field (and therefore also the flux) is proportional to the current: Φ = LI. (7.35) The constant of proportionality L is called the self-inductance (or simply the inductance) of the loop. As with M, it depends on the geometry (size and shape) of the loop. If the current changes, the emf induced in the loop is E = −L dI dt . (7.36) Inductance is measured in henries (H); a henry is a volt-second per ampere. B B I Fig. 7.33 328 7 Electrodynamics Example 7.12. Find the self-inductance of a toroidal coil with rectan- gular cross section (inner radius a, outer radius b,height h) that carries a total of N turns. Solution. The magnetic field inside the toroid is (Eq. 5.60) B = μ0NI 2πs . The flux through a single turn (Fig. 7.34)is ∫ B · da = μ0NI 2π h ∫ b a 1 s ds = μ0NIh 2π ln( b a ). The total flux is N times this, so the self-inductance (Eq. 7.35)is L = μ0N2h 2π ln( b a ). (7.37) a s b h ds Axis Fig. 7.34 Inductance (like capacitance) is an intrinsically positive quantity. Lenz’s law, which is enforced by the minus sign in Eq. 7.36, dictates that the emf is in such a direction as to oppose any change in current. For this reason, it is called a back emf. Whenever you try to alter the current in a wire, you must fight against this back emf. Inductance plays somewhat the same role in electric circuits that mass plays in mechanical systems: the greater L is, the harder it is to change the current, just as the larger the mass, the harder it is to change an object’s velocity. Example 7.13. Suppose a current I is flowing around a loop, when someone suddenly cuts the wire. The current drops “instantaneously” to zero. This generates a whopping back emf, for although I may be small, dI/dt is enormous. (That’s why you sometimes draw a spark when you unplug an iron or toaster – electromagnetic induction is desperately trying to keep the current going, even if it has to jump the gap in the circuit.) Nothing so dramatic occurs when you plug in a toaster or iron. In this case induction opposes the sudden increase in current, prescribing instead a smooth and continuous buildup. Suppose, for instance, that a battery (which supplies a constant emf E0) is connected to a circuit of resistance R and inductance L (Fig. 7.35). What current flows? 329 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction R L 0 Fig. 7.35 Solution. The total emf in this circuit is E0 from the battery plus −L(dI/dt) from the inductance. Ohm’s law, then, says 21 E0 − L dI dt = IR. This is a first-order differential equation for I as a function of time. The general solution, as you can show for yourself, is I (t) = E0 R + ke−(R/L)t, where k is a constant to be determined by the initial conditions. In particular, if you close the switch at time t = 0, so I (0) = 0, then k = −E0/R,and I (t) = E0 R [1 − e−(R/L)t]. (7.38) This function is plotted in Fig. 7.36. Had there been no inductance in the circuit, the current would have jumped immediately to E0/R. In practice, every circuit has some self-inductance, and the current approaches E0/R asymptotically. The quantity τ ≡ L/R is the time constant; it tells you how long the current takes to reach a substantial fraction (roughly two-thirds) of its final value. L /R 2L/R 3L/R I t 0/R Fig. 7.36 Problem 7.23. A small loop of wire (radius a) is held a distance z above the center of a large loop (radius b), as shown in Fig. 7.37. The planes of the two loops are parallel, and perpendicular to the common axis. (a) Suppose current I flows in the big loop. Find the flux through the little loop. (The little loop is so small that you may consider the field of the big loop to be essentially constant.) 21 Notice that −L(dI/dt) goes on the left-hand side of the equation – it is part of the emf that establishes the voltage across the resistor. 330 7 Electrodynamics (b) Suppose current I flows in the little loop. Find the flux through the big loop. (The little loop is so small that you may treat it as a magnetic dipole.) (c) Find the mutual inductances, and confirm that M12 = M21. a z b Fig. 7.37 d l Fig. 7.38 Problem 7.24. A square loop of wire, of side a, lies midway between two long wires, 3a apart, and in the same plane. (Actually, the long wires are sides of a large rectangular loop, but the short ends are so far away that they can be ignored.) A clockwise current I in the square loop is gradually increasing: dI/dt = k (a constant). Find the emf induced in the big loop. Which way will the induced current flow? Problem 7.25. Find the self-inductance per unit length of a long solenoid, of radius R, carrying n turns per unit length. Problem 7.26. Try computing the self-inductance of the “hairpin” loop shown in Fig. 7.38. (Neglect the contribution from the ends; most of the flux comes from the long straight section.) You’ll run into a snag that is characteristic of many self-inductance calculations. To get a definite answer, assume the wire has a tiny radius ϵ, and ignore any flux through the wire itself. Problem 7.27. An alternating current I (t) = I0 cos(ωt) (amplitude 0.5 A, frequency 60 Hz) flows down a straight wire, which runs along the axis of a toroidal coil with rectangular cross section (inner radius 1 cm, outer radius 2 cm, height 1 cm, 1000 turns). The coil is connected to a 500 Ω resistor. (a) In the quasistatic approximation, what emf is induced in the toroid? Find the current, IR(t), in the resistor. (b) Calculate the back emf in the coil, due to the current IR(t). What is the ratio of the amplitudes of this back emf and the “direct”emf in (a)? Problem 7.28. A capacitor C is chargeduptoavoltage V and connected to an inductor L, as shown schematically in Fig. 7.39.Attime t = 0, the switch S is closed. Find the current in the circuit as a function of time. How does your answer change if a resistor R is included in series with C and L? CL S Fig. 7.39 331 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 7.2.4 Energy in Magnetic Fields It takes a certain amount of energy to start a current flowing in a circuit. I’m not talking about the energy delivered to the resistors and converted into heat – that is irretrievably lost, as far as the circuit is concerned, and can be large or small, depending on how long you let the current run. What I am concerned with, rather, is the work you must do against the back emf to get the current going. This is a fixed amount, and it is recoverable:you get it back when the current is turned off. In the meantime, it represents energy latent in the circuit; as we’ll see in a moment, it can be regarded as energy stored in the magnetic field. The work done on a unit charge, against the back emf, in one trip around the circuit is −E (the minus sign records the fact that this is the work done by you against the emf, not the work done by the emf). The amount of charge per unit time passing down the wire is I. So the total work done per unit time is dW dt = −EI = LI dI dt . If we start with zero current and build it up to a final value I, the work done (integrating the last equation over time) is W = 1 2 LI 2. (7.39) It does not depend on how long we take to crank up the current, only on the geometry of the loop (in the form of L) and the final current I. There is a nicer way to write W , which has the advantage that it is readily generalized to surface and volume currents. Remember that the flux Φ through the loop is equal to LI (Eq. 7.35). On the other hand, Φ = ∫ B · da = ∫ (∇ × A) · da = ∮ A · dl, where the line integral is around the perimeter of the loop. Thus LI = ∮ A · dl, and therefore W = 1 2 I ∮ A · dl = 1 2 ∮ (A · I) dl. (7.40) In this form, the generalization to volume currents is obvious: W = 1 2 ∫ V(A · J) dτ. (7.41) But we can do even better, and express W entirely in terms of the magnetic field: Ampère’s law, ∇ × B = μ0J, lets us eliminate J: W = 1 2μ0 ∫ A · (∇ × B) dτ. (7.42) 332 7 Electrodynamics Integration by parts transfers the derivative from B to A; specifically, product rule 6 states that ∇ · (A × B) = B · (∇ × A) − A · (∇ × B), so A · (∇ × B) = B · B − ∇ · (A × B). Consequently, W = 1 2μ0 [∫ B2 dτ − ∫ ∇ · (A × B) dτ] = 1 2μ0 [∫ V B2 dτ − ∮ S(A × B) · da], (7.43) where S is the surface bounding the volume V. Now, the integration in Eq. 7.41 is to be taken over the entire volume occupied by the current. But any region larger than this will do just as well, since J is zero out there anyway. In Eq. 7.43, the larger the region we pick the greater is the contribution from the volume integral, and therefore the smaller is that of the surface integral (this makes sense: as the surface gets farther from the current, both A and B decrease). In particular, if we agree to integrate over all space, then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with W = 1 2μ0 ∫ all space B2 dτ. (7.44) In view of this result, we say the energy is “stored in the magnetic field,” in the amount (B2/2μ0) per unit volume. This is a nice way to think of it, though someone looking at Eq. 7.41 might prefer to say that the energy is stored in the current distribution, in the amount 1 2 (A · J) per unit volume. The distinction is one of bookkeeping; the important quantity is the total energy W , and we need not worry about where (if anywhere) the energy is “located.” (The same issue arose in the case of electrostatic energy – Section 2.4.4.) You might find it strange that it takes energy to set up a magnetic field – after all, magnetic fields themselves do no work. The point is that producing a magnetic field, where previously there was none, requires changing the field, and a changing B-field, according to Faraday, induces an electric field. The latter, of course, can do work. In the beginning, there is no E, and at the end there is no E; but in between, while B is building up, there is an E, and it is against this that the work is done. (You see why I could not calculate the energy stored in a magnetostatic field back in Chapter 5.) In light of this, it is extraordinary how similar the magnetic energy formulas are to their electrostatic counterparts:22 22 For an illuminating confirmation of Eq. 7.44, using the method of Prob. 2.45, see T. H. Boyer, Am.J.Phys. 69, 1 (2001). 333 7.2 Electromagnetic Induction Welec = 1 2 ∫ (V ρ) dτ = ϵ0 2 ∫ E2 dτ,(2.43 and 2.45) Wmag = 1 2 ∫ (A · J) dτ = 1 2μ0 ∫ B2 dτ.(7.41 and 7.44) Example 7.14. A long coaxial cable carries current I (the current flows down the surface of the inner cylinder, radius a, and back along the outer cylinder, radius b) as shown in Fig. 7.40. Find the magnetic energy stored in a section of length l. I a b I Fig. 7.40 Solution. According to Ampère’s law, the field between the cylinders is B = μ0I 2πs ˆφ. Elsewhere, the field is zero. Thus, the energy per unit volume is 1 2μ0 ( μ0I 2πs ) 2 = μ0I 2 8π2s2 . The energy in a cylindrical shell of length l, radius s, and thickness ds, then, is ( μ0I 2 8π2s2 )2πls ds = μ0I 2l 4π ( ds s ). Integrating from a to b,wehave W = μ0I 2l 4π ln( b a ). By the way, this suggests a very simple way to calculate the self- inductance of the cable. According to Eq. 7.39, the energy can also be written as 1 2 LI 2. Comparing the two expressions, 23 L = μ0l 2π ln( b a ). This method of calculating self-inductance is especially useful when the current is not confined to a single path, but spreads over some surface or volume, so that different parts of the current enclose dif- ferent amounts of flux. In such cases, it can be very tricky to get the inductance directly from Eq. 7.35, and it is best to let Eq. 7.39 define L. 23 Notice the similarity to Eq. 7.37 – in a sense, the rectangular toroid is a short coaxial cable, turned on its side. 334 7 Electrodynamics Problem 7.29. Find the energy stored in a section of length l of a long solenoid (radius R, current I, n turns per unit length): (a) using Eq. 7.39 (you found L in Prob. 7.25), (b) using Eq. 7.40 (we worked out A in Ex. 5.12), (c) using Eq. 7.44, and (d) using Eq. 7.43 (take as your volume the cylindrical tube from radius a < R out to radius b > R). Problem 7.30. Calculate the energy stored in the toroidal coil of Ex. 7.12, by applying Eq. 7.44. Use the answer to check Eq. 7.37. Problem 7.31.

[Hint: Treat them as magnetic dipoles, and use Eq. 5.88.] Is your formula consistent with Eq. 7.33? (b) Suppose a current I1 is flowing in loop 1, and we propose to turn on a current I2 in loop 2. How much work must be done, against the mutually induced emf, to keep the current I1 flowing in loop 1? In light of this result, comment on Eq. 6.35. Problem 7.34.

Do it two ways, and compare your answers: 335 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations (a) Find the magnetic field and the induced electric field (in the quasistatic approximation), inside and outside the cylinder, in terms of ω, ˙ω,and s (the distance from the axis). Calculate the torque you must exert, and from that obtain the work done per unit length (W = ∫ Ndφ). (b) Use Eq. 7.44 to determine the energy stored in the resulting magnetic field. 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 7.3.1 Electrodynamics before Maxwell So far, we have encountered the following laws, specifying the divergence and curl of electric and magnetic fields: (i) ∇ · E = ρ/ϵ0 (Gauss’s law), (ii) ∇ · B = 0 (no name), (iii) ∇ × E = −∂B/∂t (Faraday’s law), (iv) ∇ × B = μ0J (Ampère’s law). These equations represent the state of electromagnetic theory in the mid- nineteenth century, when Maxwell began his work. They were not written in so compact a form, in those days, but their physical content was familiar. Now, it happens that there is a fatal inconsistency in these formulas. It has to do with the old rule that divergence of curl is always zero. If you apply the divergence to number (iii), everything works out: ∇ · (∇ × E) = ∇ · (− ∂B ∂t ) = − ∂ ∂t (∇ · B). The left-hand side is zero because divergence of curl is zero; the right-hand side is zero by virtue of equation (ii). But when you do the same thing to number (iv), you get into trouble: ∇ · (∇ × B) = μ0(∇ · J); (7.45) the left-hand side must be zero, but the right-hand side, in general, is not. For steady currents, the divergence of J is zero, but when we go beyond magnetostatics Ampère’s law cannot be right. There’s another way to see that Ampère’s law is bound to fail for nonsteady currents. Suppose we’re in the process of charging up a capacitor (Fig. 7.43). In integral form, Ampère’s law reads ∮ B · dl = μ0Ienc. I want to apply it to the Ampèrian loop shown in the diagram. How do I determine Ienc? Well, it’s the total current passing through the loop, or, more precisely, the current piercing a surface that has the loop for 336 7 Electrodynamics Capacitor Battery Amperian loop I ` Fig. 7.43 its boundary. In this case, the simplest surface lies in the plane of the loop – the wire punctures this surface, so Ienc = I. Fine – but what if I draw instead the bubble-shaped surface in Fig. 7.43? No current passes through this surface, and I conclude that Ienc = 0! We never had this problem in magnetostatics because the conflict arises only when charge is piling up somewhere (in this case, on the capacitor plates). But for nonsteady currents (such as this one) “the current enclosed by the loop” is an ill-defined notion; it depends entirely on what surface you use. (If this seems pedantic to you – “obviously one should use the plane surface” – remember that the Ampèrian loop could be some contorted shape that doesn’t even lie in a plane.) Of course, we had no right to expect Ampère’s law to hold outside of magnetostatics; after all, we derived it from the Biot–Savart law. However, in Maxwell’s time there was no experimental reason to doubt that Ampère’s law was of wider validity. The flaw was a purely theoretical one, and Maxwell fixed it by purely theoretical arguments. 7.3.2 How Maxwell Fixed Ampère’s Law The problem is on the right-hand side of Eq. 7.45, which should be zero, but isn’t. Applying the continuity equation (Eq. 5.29) and Gauss’s law, the offending term can be rewritten: ∇ · J = − ∂ρ ∂t = − ∂ ∂t (ϵ0∇ · E) = −∇ · (ϵ0 ∂E ∂t ). If we were to combine ϵ0(∂E/∂t) with J, in Ampère’s law, it would be just right to kill off the extra divergence: ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . (7.46) (Maxwell himself had other reasons for wanting to add this quantity to Ampère’s law. To him, the rescue of the continuity equation was a happy dividend rather than a primary motive. But today we recognize this 337 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations argument as a far more compelling one than Maxwell’s, which was based on a now-discredited model of the ether. 24) Such a modification changes nothing, as far as magnetostatics is con- cerned: when E is constant, we still have ∇ × B = μ0J. In fact, Maxwell’s term is hard to detect in ordinary electromagnetic experiments, where it must compete for attention with J – that’s why Faraday and the others never discovered it in the laboratory. However, it plays a crucial role in the propagation of electromagnetic waves, as we’ll see in Chapter 9. Apart from curing the defect in Ampère’s law, Maxwell’s term has a certain aesthetic appeal: just as a changing magnetic field induces an electric field (Faraday’s law), so 25 a changing electric field induces a magnetic field. Of course, theoretical convenience and aesthetic consistency are only sug- gestive – there might, after all, be other ways to doctor up Ampère’s law. The real confirmation of Maxwell’s theory came in 1888 with Hertz’s experiments on electromagnetic waves. Maxwell called his extra term the displacement current: Jd ≡ ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . (7.47) (It’s a misleading name; ϵ0(∂E/∂t) has nothing to do with current, except that it adds to J in Ampère’s law.) Let’s see now how displacement current resolves the paradox of the charging capacitor (Fig. 7.43). If the capacitor plates are very close together (I didn’t draw them that way, but the calcula- tion is simpler if you assume this), then the electric field between them is E = 1 ϵ0 σ = 1 ϵ0 Q A , where Q is the charge on the plate and A is its area. Thus, between the plates, ∂E ∂t = 1 ϵ0A dQ dt = 1 ϵ0A I. Now, the “new, improved” Ampère’s law (Eq. 7.46) reads, in integral form, ∮ B · dl = μ0Ienc + μ0ϵ0 ∫ ( ∂E ∂t ) · da. (7.48) If we choose the flat surface, then E = 0and Ienc = I. If, on the other hand, we use the balloon-shaped surface, then Ienc = 0, but ∫ (∂E/∂t) · da = I/ϵ0. So we get the same answer for either surface, though in the first case it comes from the conduction current, and in the second from the displacement current. 24 For the history of this subject, see A. M. Bork, Am. J. Phys. 31, 854 (1963). 25 See footnote 11 for commentary on the word “induce.” The same issue arises here: Should a changing electric field be regarded as an independent source of magnetic field (along with current)? In a proximate sense it does function as a source, but since the electric field itself was produced by charges and currents, they alone are the “ultimate” sources of E and B. See S. E. Hill, Phys. Teach. 49, 343 (2011); for a contrary view, see C. Savage, Phys. Teach. 50, 226 (2012). 338 7 Electrodynamics Example 7.15. Imagine two concentric metal spherical shells (Fig. 7.44). The inner one (radius a) carries a charge Q(t), and the outer one (radius b) an opposite charge −Q(t). The space between them is filled with ohmic material of conductivity σ, so a radial current flows: J = σE = σ 1 4πϵ0 Q r2 ˆr, I = − ˙Q = ∫ J · da = σQ ϵ0 . This configuration is spherically symmetrical, so the magnetic field has to be zero (the only direction it could possibly point is radial, and ∇ · B = 0 ⇒ ∮ B · da = B(4πr 2) = 0, so B = 0). What? I thought currents produce magnetic fields! Isn’t that what Biot–Savart and Ampère taught us? How can there be a J with no accompanying B? Solution. This is not a static configuration: Q, E,and J are all func- tions of time; Ampère and Biot–Savart do not apply. The displacement current Jd = ϵ0 ∂E ∂t = 1 4π ˙Q r2 ˆr = −σ Q 4πϵ0r2 ˆr exactly cancels the conduction current (in Eq. 7.46), and the magnetic field (determined by ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = 0) is indeed zero. J a b Fig. 7.44 Problem 7.35. A fat wire, radius a, carries a constant current I, uniformly distributed over its cross section. A narrow gap in the wire, of width w ≪ a, forms a parallel-plate capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.45. Find the magnetic field in the gap, at a distance s < a from the axis. a w I I \u0004σ \u0002σ Fig. 7.45 Problem 7.36. The preceding problem was an artificial model for the charging capacitor, designed to avoid complications associated with the current spreading out over the surface of 339 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations the plates. For a more realistic model, imagine thin wires that connect to the centers of the plates (Fig. 7.46a). Again, the current I is constant, the radius of the capacitor is a, and the separation of the plates is w ≪ a. Assume that the current flows out over the plates in such a way that the surface charge is uniform, at any given time, and is zero at t = 0. (a) Find the electric field between the plates, as a function of t. (b) Find the displacement current through a circle of radius s in the plane midway between the plates. Using this circle as your “Ampèrian loop,” and the flat surface that spans it, find the magnetic field at a distance s from the axis. (c) Repeat part (b), but this time use the cylindrical surface in Fig. 7.46b, which is open at the right-hand end and extends to the left through the plate and terminates outside the capacitor. Notice that the displacement current through this surface is zero, and there are two contributions to Ienc.26 II II (b)(a) w s Fig. 7.46 Problem 7.37. Refer to Prob. 7.17, to which the correct answer was E(s, t) = μ0I0ω 2π sin(ωt) ln( a s )ˆz. (a) Find the displacement current density Jd. (b) Integrate it to get the total displacement current, Id = ∫ Jd · da. (c) Compare Id and I. (What’s their ratio?) If the outer cylinder were, say, 2 mm in diameter, how high would the frequency have to be, for Id to be 1 percent of I ? [This problem is designed to indicate why Faraday never discovered displacement currents, and why it is ordinarily safe to ignore them unless the frequency is extremely high.] Problem 7.38. A conducting spherical shell (radius R, centered at the origin) is being charged by a steady current I flowing up the z-axis and connected to the “south pole,” where it spreads out uniformly over the surface (see Fig. 7.47). The total charge on the sphere, at time t,is Q(t) = It. Find the magnetic field at a point (r, θ, φ) exterior to the sphere. First decide what direction you think B points; then apply the Ampère/Maxwell law in integral form 26 This problem raises an interesting quasi-philosophical question: If you measure B in the laboratory, have you detected the effects of displacement current (as (b) would suggest), or merely confirmed the effects of ordinary currents (as (c) implies)? See D. F. Bartlett, Am. J. Phys. 58, 1168 (1990). 340 7 Electrodynamics (Eq. 7.48) to an appropriate Ampèrian loop. In fact, do it three different ways: using (as the surface bounded by the Ampèrian loop) (a) a spherical cap north of the loop, (b) a spherical bowl south of the loop, and (c) a cone with vertex at the origin. (d) What does your result say for θ very near to π?27 R r θ z I (a) (b) (c) Fig. 7.47 7.3.3 Maxwell’s Equations In the last section we put the finishing touches on Maxwell’s equations: 28 (i) ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ (Gauss’s law), (ii) ∇ · B = 0 (no name), (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t (Faraday’s law), (iv) ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t (Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction). (7.49) Together with the Lorentz force law, F = q(E + v × B), (7.50) they summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics29 (save for some special properties of matter, which we encountered in Chapters 4 and 6). Even the continuity equation, ∇ · J = − ∂ρ ∂t , (7.51) 27 T. H. Boyer, Am.J.Phys. 87, 729 (2019). 28 Maxwell didn’t have access to modern vector notation (in particular, the del operator), and in his formulation there were actually 20 equations – including the potentials as well as the fields. It was Oliver Heaviside who distilled them into the tidy package we now know as “Maxwell’s equations.” See B. J. Hunt, Physics Today November 2012, p. 48. 29 Like any differential equations, Maxwell’s must be supplemented by suitable boundary conditions. Because these are typically “obvious” from the context (for example, E and B go to zero at large distances from a localized charge distribution), it is easy to forget that they play an essential role. 341 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations which is the mathematical expression of conservation of charge, can be derived from Maxwell’s equations by applying the divergence to num- ber (iv). I have written Maxwell’s equations in the traditional way, which empha- sizes that they specify the divergence and curl of E and B. In this form, they reinforce the notion that electric fields can be produced either by charges (ρ) or by changing magnetic fields (∂B/∂t), and magnetic fields can be produced either by currents (J) or by changing electric fields (∂E/∂t). Actually, this is misleading, because ∂B/∂t and ∂E/∂t are themselves due to charges and currents. I think it is logically preferable to write (i) ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ, (iii) ∇ × E + ∂B ∂t = 0, (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × B − μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t = μ0J, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (7.52) with the fields (E and B) on the left and the sources (ρ and J)onthe right. This notation emphasizes that all electromagnetic fields are ultimately attributable to charges and currents. Maxwell’s equations tell you how charges produce fields; reciprocally, the force law tells you how fields affect charges. Problem 7.39. Suppose E(r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 q r2 θ(vt − r)ˆr, B(r, t) = 0. (The theta function is defined in Prob. 1.46b.) Show that these fields satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations, and determine ρ and J. Describe the physical situation that gives rise to these fields. 7.3.4 Magnetic Charge There is a pleasing symmetry to Maxwell’s equations; it is particularly striking in free space, where ρ and J vanish: ∇ · E = 0, ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × B = μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ If you replace E by B and B by −μ0ϵ0E, the first pair of equations turns into the second, and vice versa. This symmetry 30 between E and B is spoiled, though, by the charge term in Gauss’s law and the current term in Ampère’s law. You can’t help wondering why the corresponding quantities are “missing” from ∇ · B = 0and ∇ × E = −∂B/∂t.Whatif wehad 30 Don’t be distracted by the pesky constants μ0 and ϵ0; these are present only because the SI system measures E and B in different units, and would not occur, for instance, in the Gaussian system. 342 7 Electrodynamics (i) ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρe, (iii) ∇ × E = −μ0Jm − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = μ0ρm,(iv) ∇ × B = μ0Je + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (7.53) Then ρm would represent the density of magnetic “charge,” and ρe the density of electric charge; Jm would be the current of magnetic charge, and Je the current of electric charge. Both charges would be conserved: ∇ · Jm = − ∂ρm ∂t and ∇ · Je = − ∂ρe ∂t . (7.54) The former follows by application of the divergence to (iii), the latter by taking the divergence of (iv). In a sense, Maxwell’s equations beg for magnetic charge to exist – it would fit in so nicely. And yet, in spite of a diligent search, no one has ever found any.31 As farasweknow, ρm is zero everywhere, and so is Jm; B is not on equal footing with E: there exist stationary sources for E (electric charges) but none for B. (This is reflected in the fact that magnetic multipole expansions have no monopole term, and magnetic dipoles consist of current loops, not separated north and south “poles.”) Apparently God just didn’t make any magnetic charge. (In quantum electrodynamics, by the way, it’s a more than merely aesthetic shame that magnetic charge does not seem to exist: Dirac showed that the existence of magnetic charge would explain why electric charge is quantized.See Prob. 8.21.) Problem 7.40. Assuming that “Coulomb’s law”for magnetic charges (qm)reads F = μ0 4π qm1 qm2 2 ˆ, (7.55) work out the force law for a monopole qm moving with velocity v through electric and magnetic fields E and B.32 Problem 7.41. Suppose a magnetic monopole qm passes through a resistanceless loop of wire with self-inductance L. What current is induced in the loop?33 7.3.5 Maxwell’s Equations in Matter Maxwell’s equations in the form 7.49 are complete and correct as they stand. However, when you are working with materials that are subject to electric and magnetic polarization there is a more convenient way to write 31 For an extensive bibliography, see A. S. Goldhaber and W. P. Trower, Am.J.Phys. 58, 429 (1990). 32 For interesting commentary, see W. Rindler, Am.J.Phys. 57, 993 (1989). 33 This is one of the methods used to search for monopoles in the laboratory; see B. Cabrera, Phys.Rev.Lett. 48, 1378 (1982). 343 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations σ σ Fig. 7.48 them. For inside polarized matter there will be accumulations of “bound” charge and current, over which you exert no direct control. It would be nice to reformulate Maxwell’s equations so as to make explicit reference only to the “free” charges and currents. We have already learned, from the static case, that an electric polarization P produces a bound charge density ρb = −∇ · P (7.56) (Eq. 4.12). Likewise, a magnetic polarization (or “magnetization”) M results in a bound current Jb = ∇ × M (7.57) (Eq. 6.13). There’s just one new feature to consider in the nonstatic case: any change in the electric polarization involves a flow of (bound) charge, which must be included in the total current. For suppose we examine a tiny chunk of polarized material (Fig. 7.48). The polarization introduces achargedensity σb = P at one end and −σb at the other (Eq. 4.11). If P now increases a bit, the charge on each end increases accordingly, giving a net current dI = ∂σb ∂t da⊥ = ∂P ∂t da⊥. The current density, therefore, is Jp = ∂P ∂t . (7.58) This polarization current has nothing to do with the bound current Jb.The latter is associated with magnetization of the material and involves the spin and orbital motion of electrons; Jp, by contrast, is the result of the linear motion of charge when the electric polarization changes. If P points to the right, and is increasing, then each plus charge moves a bit to the right and each minus charge to the left; the cumulative effect is the polarization current Jp. We ought to check that Eq. 7.58 is consistent with the continuity equa- tion: ∇ · Jp = ∇ · ∂P ∂t = ∂ ∂t (∇ · P) = − ∂ρb ∂t . Yes: The continuity equation is satisfied; in fact, Jp is essential to ensure the conservation of bound charge. (Incidentally, a changing magnetization does not lead to any analogous accumulation of charge or current. The bound 344 7 Electrodynamics current Jb = ∇ × M varies in response to changes in M, to be sure, but that’s about it.) In view of all this, the total charge density can be separated into two parts: ρ = ρf + ρb = ρf − ∇ · P, (7.59) and the current density into three parts: J = Jf + Jb + Jp = Jf + ∇ × M + ∂P ∂t . (7.60) Gauss’s law can now be written as ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 (ρf − ∇ · P), or ∇ · D = ρf , (7.61) where, as in the static case, D ≡ ϵ0E + P. (7.62) Meanwhile, Ampère’s law (with Maxwell’s term) becomes ∇ × B = μ0 (Jf + ∇ × M + ∂P ∂t ) + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t , or ∇ × H = Jf + ∂D ∂t , (7.63) where, as before, H ≡ 1 μ0 B − M. (7.64) Faraday’s law and ∇ · B = 0 are not affected by our separation of charge and current into free and bound parts, since they do not involve ρ or J. In terms of free charges and currents, then, Maxwell’s equations read (i) ∇ · D = ρf , (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × H = Jf + ∂D ∂t . (7.65) Some people regard these as the “true” Maxwell’s equations, but please understand that they are in no way more “general” than Eq. 7.49; they simply reflect a convenient division of charge and current into free and nonfree parts. And they have the disadvantage of hybrid notation, since they contain both E and D, both B and H. They must be supplemented, therefore, by appropriate constitutive relations, giving D and H in terms of E and B. These depend on the nature of the material; for linear media, P = ϵ0χeE and M = χmH, (7.66) 345 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations so D = ϵE and H = 1 μ B, (7.67) where ϵ ≡ ϵ0(1 + χe) and μ ≡ μ0(1 + χm). You may remember that D is called the electric “displacement”; that’s why the second term in the Ampère/Maxwell equation (iv) came to be called the displacement current. In this context, Jd ≡ ∂D ∂t . (7.68) Problem 7.42. Sea water at frequency ν = 4 × 108 Hz has permittivity ϵ = 81ϵ0,perme- ability μ = μ0, and resistivity ρ = 0.23 Ω · m. What is the (amplitude) ratio of conduction current to displacement current in sea water, at this frequency? [Hint: Consider a parallel-plate capacitor immersed in sea water and driven by a voltage V0 cos(2πνt).] 7.3.6 Boundary Conditions In general, the fields E, B, D,and H will be discontinuous at a boundary between two different media, or at a surface that carries a charge density σ or a current density K. The explicit form of these discontinuities can be deduced from Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 7.65), in their integral form (i) ∮ S D · da = Qfenc, (ii) ∮ S B · da = 0, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ over any closed surface S. (iii) ∮ P E · dl = − d dt ∫ S B · da, (iv) ∮ P H · dl = Ienc + d dt ∫ S D · da, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ for any surface S bounded by the closed loop P. Applying (i) to a tiny, wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox extending just slightly into the material on either side of the boundary (Fig. 7.49), we obtain Dabove · a − Dbelow · a = σf a. (The positive direction for a is “upward.”) The edge of the wafer contributes nothing in the limit as the thickness goes to zero; nor does any volume charge density.) Thus, the component of D that is perpendicular to the interface is discontinuous in the amount D ⊥ above − D ⊥ below = σf . (7.69) Identical reasoning, applied to equation (ii), yields B⊥ above − B⊥ below = 0. (7.70) 346 7 Electrodynamics σf Dbelow Dabove a Fig. 7.49 Turning to (iii), a very thin Ampèrian loop straddling the surface gives Eabove · l − Ebelow · l = − d dt ∫ S B · da. But in the limit as the width of the loop goes to zero, the flux vanishes. (I have already dropped the contribution of the two ends to ∮ E · dl,onthe same grounds.) Therefore, E ∥ above − E ∥ below = 0. (7.71) That is, the components of E parallel to the interface are continuous across the boundary. By the same token, (iv) implies Habove · l − Hbelow · l = Ifenc, where Ifenc is the free current passing through the Ampèrian loop. No volume current density will contribute (in the limit of infinitesimal width), but a surface current can. In fact, if ˆn is a unit vector perpendicular to the interface (pointing “upward”), so that (ˆn × l) is normal to the Ampèrian loop (Fig. 7.50), then Ifenc = Kf · (ˆn × l) = (Kf × ˆn) · l, and hence H ∥ above − H ∥ below = Kf × ˆn. (7.72) So the parallel components of H are discontinuous by an amount propor- tional to the free surface current density. Equations 7.69–7.72 are the general boundary conditions for electrody- namics. In the case of linear media, they can be expressed in terms of E and B alone: 347 7.4 The Field of a Rotating Magnet Kf l n above below ˆ Fig. 7.50 (i) ϵaboveE⊥ above − ϵbelowE⊥ below = σf , (ii) B⊥ above − B⊥ below = 0, (iii) E ∥ above − E ∥ below = 0, (iv) 1 μabove B ∥ above − 1 μbelow B ∥ below = Kf × ˆn. (7.73) In particular, if there is no free charge or free current at the interface, then (i) ϵaboveE⊥ above − ϵbelowE⊥ below = 0, (ii) B⊥ above − B⊥ below = 0, (iii) E ∥ above − E ∥ below = 0, (iv) 1 μabove B ∥ above − 1 μbelow B ∥ below = 0. (7.74) As we shall see in Chapter 9, these equations are the basis for the theory of reflection and refraction. 7.4 The Field of a Rotating Magnet Imagine an axially symmetric magnet rotating at constant angular velocity about its axis – a cylindrical bar magnet, if you like, or for that matter the Earth itself (pretending that the magnetic axis coincides with the rotation axis). It is natural to wonder whether its magnetic field is stationary, or rotates with the magnet (or, as Arlo Guthrie would say, “Maybe it doesn’t even matter”). Are the field lines “dragged along” by the rotation of the source? Faraday did a series of experiments (variations on the disk experiment of Ex. 7.4) that appeared to settle the issue. Mounting the magnet along the axis of the disk he first held the magnet still while he rotated the disk (that’s the original version), and a current was generated in the circuit (Fig. 7.51). Then he allowed the magnet to rotate at the same rate as the disk; again a current was generated. Finally, he held the disk at rest and rotated the magnet. This time no current flowed. He concluded 348 7 Electrodynamics S N S N S N w w w w Fig. 7.51 that the field of the rotating magnet is the same as that of the stationary magnet: that’s why the first two experiments give the same result, and the third is just what you’d get if the magnet were at rest. Apparently a magnet rotating about its axis of symmetry does not drag the field around as it spins; the field lines are stationary.34 And yet, if the magnet rotates about an axis perpendicular to its axis of symmetry, then it certainly does drag the field along with it. The field lines loop around from the north pole to the south pole, and that direction keeps changing. So not everyone accepted Faraday’s conclusion, until 1912 when experiments by S. J. Barnett finally led to a consensus that Faraday was right – in particular, the Earth’s magnetic field (or more precisely the part of it associated with rotation about the geographic north-south axis) does not rotate with the Earth. 35 But what exactly does it mean to say that the field lines do (or do not) rotate with their source? Faraday had a very concrete conception of field lines as a network of “wires” (or cobwebs) existing “out there” in space. In that case, to say that they are moving (or not) makes perfect sense. But in Maxwell’s theory it is fields that have real physical existence, and field lines are just constructs we devise (by joining up the arrows that represent the fields themselves) to help us visualize (and draw) the fields. And we have already learned that even static magnetic field lines can be problematic (Section 5.3.4). Consider for a moment the electrical analog. Imagine a point charge at rest at the origin. Its (electric) field “radiates” out in all directions, and it is (obviously) constant in time (Fig. 7.52). The field lines are like spokes on a a’’’ a a’’ a’ t=2t=1t=0 Fig. 7.52 34 If the magnetic field lines were moving, they would presumably have induced an electric field, just as they did in Fig. 7.21b. 35 For the full history, see C. F. Chyba and K. P. Hand, Phys. Rev. Appl. 6, 014017 (2016). 349 7.4 The Field of a Rotating Magnet wheel (or rather pins in a pin cushion, in three dimensions). A moment later the picture looks exactly the same. But suppose I ask which field line at t = 1 corresponds to the field line I labeled a at t = 0? It’s a′, obviously (I hear you say). Not so fast! Why not a′′? That would still be a perfectly good field-line pattern, representing exactly the same field. The labeling of the field lines is completely arbitrary, with no physical content at all. If you prefer to say that the field line called a (at t = 0) “corresponds” to the field line a′′ at t = 1, and then to a′′′ at t = 2, and so on, more power to you! For you, the field lines rotate, even though the source does not. It’s not wrong, exactly (it describes the field correctly at every moment), it’s just dumb – a complicated and confusing way to think about something that is intrinsically simple and straightforward. But suppose instead of a point charge we have a uniformly charged sphere, and it’s (uniformly) rotating. The electric field is exactly the same (for points outside), and it’s still static (because the charge density is constant in time). It is now accompanied by a (static) magnetic field, but that doesn’t alter the electric field. Now, however, it is not quite so dumb to wonder whether the electric field lines rotate with the sphere. Well, let ’em rotate, if it pleases you (you can even have them rotate at some completely different rate, about some other axis, if you want to be really perverse); this has nothing to do with physics – they represent the same electric field –it just has to do with how you choose to direct the field-line movie. Arlo was right: it doesn’t even matter. Field lines tell you two things: their density tells you the magnitude of the field, and the arrow tells you its direction. As long as they get those two things right, you can’t ask for more, because that’s all there is to know about the fields. Which field line at one moment corresponds to which field line at some other moment … that’s a metaphysical question; it has no “right” answer, because it is devoid of physical content. And for electric fields that’s pretty much the end of the story. But the magnetic case is more pernicious, because of the v in the Lorentz force law. That’s the velocity of the charge … but relative to what? Nowadays we would answer “relative to whatever inertial reference frame you choose to work in – the frame in which the magnetic field is B.” But if you conceive of magnetic field lines as “wires” out there in space, moving around in time, it is easy to persuade yourself (at any rate, it was in the nineteenth century) that v must be the velocity of the charge relative to the field line at that location. (Remember those electrical engineers talking about “cutting” field lines.) And if that is the case (which, I hasten to say, it is not36) then it matters critically whether the field lines are dragged along with the rotation of the magnet. If they are dragged along, then Faraday should have found the same current when the magnet rotated and the disk was at rest as he did when the disk rotated and the magnet was at rest, and 36 Footnote 34 was just plain wrong: moving magnetic field lines don’t induce electric fields – time-dependent fields do. 350 7 Electrodynamics he should have seen no current when the two rotated together. But that’s the opposite of what he actually observed, so he concluded that the field lines are not dragged along by the rotation of the magnet. And similarly Barnett concluded that the Earth does not drag its magnetic field around as it rotates. It’s not an unreasonable inference, and in practice it is sometimes an illuminating way to picture how the field evolves in time. That’s why geophysicists, plasma physicists, and astrophysicists use this language. But it is a choice, not something forced by the laws of electrodynamics, so when you read about field lines being “dragged” around, ask yourself what precisely the author means by the statement, and remind yourself that field lines don’t come in different colors (or carry serial numbers) so you could keep track of individual lines from frame to frame in the movie.

The space surrounding the pipes is filled with weakly conducting material of conductivity σ. Find the current per unit length that flows from one pipe to the other. [Hint: Refer to Prob. 3.14.] 2d–V0 a a +V0 σ Fig. 7.53 ! Problem 7.44. A rare case in which the electrostatic field E for a circuit can actually be calculated is the following:37 Imagine an infinitely long cylindrical sheet, of uniform resistivity and radius a. A slot (corresponding to the battery) is maintained at ±V0/2,at φ = ± π, and a steady current flows over the surface, as indicated in Fig. 7.54. According to Ohm’s law, then, V (a, φ) = V0φ 2π (−π < φ < +π). (a) Use separation of variables in cylindrical coordinates to determine V (s, φ) inside and outside the cylinder. [Answer: (V0/π) tan−1[(s sin φ)/(a+s cos φ)] (for s < a); (V0/π) tan−1[(a sin φ)/(s + a cos φ)] (for s > a).] (b) Find the surface charge density on the cylinder. [Answer: (ϵ0V0/πa) tan(φ/2).] 37 See M. A. Heald, Am.J.Phys. 52, 522 (1984). See also J. A. Hernandes and A. K. T.

The magnetic field outside a long straight wire carrying a steady current I is B = μ0 2π I s ˆφ. The electric field inside thewireisuniform: E = I ρ πa2 ˆz, where ρ is the resistivity and a is the radius (see Exs. 7.1 and 7.3). Question: What is the electric field outside the wire?38 The answer depends on how you complete the circuit. Suppose the current returns along a perfectly conducting grounded coaxial cylinder of radius b (Fig. 7.55). In the region a < s < b, the potential V (s, z) satisfies Laplace’s equation, with the boundary conditions (i) V (a, z) = − I ρz πa2 , (ii) V (b, z) = 0. z a b I I Fig. 7.55 This does not suffice to determine the answer – we still need to specify boundary conditions at the two ends (though for a long wire it shouldn’t matter much). In the literature, it is customary to sweep this ambiguity under the rug by simply stipulating that V (s, z) is proportional to z : V (s, z) = zf (s). On this assumption: (a) determine f (s); (b) find E(s, z); (c) calculate the surface charge density σ(z) on the wire. 38 This is a famous problem, first analyzed by Sommerfeld and others, and known in its most recent incarnation as Merzbacher’s puzzle. See A. Sommerfeld, Electrodynamics, Academic Press, New York (1952), p. 125; E. Merzbacher, Am. J. Phys. 48, 178 (1980); further references in R. N. Varnay and L. H. Fisher, Am.J.Phys. 52, 1097 (1984). 352 7 Electrodynamics [Answer: V = (−Izρ/πa2)[ln(s/b)/ ln(a/b)]. This is a peculiar result, since Es and σ(z) are not independent of z – as one would certainly expect for a truly infinite wire.] Problem 7.46. Refer to Prob. 7.21 and Fig. 7.21b. As a quantitative model,39 let the magnetic field be uniform (−B0ˆz) in the shaded region (width w), but taper off linearly in a slab of width d at the left- and right-hand surfaces (Fig. 7.56). Choose axes with x horizontal (to the right), y vertical (upward), and z coming out of the page, with the origin at the center of the left end of the wire loop. Set the clock so the left edge of the magnet passes the origin at t = 0. y x d dw vt h 12 3 45 Fig. 7.56 (a) What is B(x, t) in each of the five regions? (Let the magnet extend indefinitely in the y and z directions.) (b) Differentiate to get ∂B/∂t, and specify the regions in which it is nonzero. (c) Find the induced electric field in region 3, and the resulting emf in the loop. Is it what you expected? Problem 7.47. In a perfect conductor, the conductivity is infinite, so E = 0 (Eq. 7.3), and any net charge resides on the surface (just as it does for an imperfect conductor, in electrostatics). (a) Show that the magnetic field is constant (∂B/∂t = 0), inside a perfect conductor. (b) Show that the magnetic flux through a (stationary) perfectly conducting loop is constant. A superconductor is a perfect conductor with the additional property that (the constant) B inside is in fact zero. (This “flux exclusion”is known as the Meissner effect.40) (c) Show that the current in a superconductor is confined to the surface. (d) Superconductivity is lost above a certain critical temperature (Tc), which varies from one material to another. Suppose you had a sphere (radius a) above its critical temperature, and you held it in a uniform magnetic field B0ˆz while cooling it below Tc. Find the induced surface current density K, as a function of the polar angle θ. 39 This problem was suggested by Martin Ligare. 40 The Meissner effect is sometimes referred to as “perfect diamagnetism,” in the sense that the field inside is not merely reduced, but canceled entirely. However, the surface currents responsible for this are free, not bound, so the actual mechanism is quite different. 353 More Problems on Chapter 7 Problem 7.48. A familiar demonstration of superconductivity (Prob. 7.47) is the levitation of a magnet over a piece of superconducting material. This phenomenon can be analyzed using the method of images.41 Treat the magnet as a perfect dipole m, a height z above the origin (and constrained to point in the z direction), and pretend that the superconductor occupies the entire half-space below the xy plane. Because of the Meissner effect, B = 0 for z ≤ 0,and since B is divergenceless, the normal (z) component is continuous, so Bz = 0 just above the surface. This boundary condition is met by the image configuration in which an identical dipole is placed at −z, as a stand-in for the superconductor; the two arrangements therefore produce the same magnetic field in the region z > 0. (a) Which way should the image dipole point (+z or −z)? (b) Find the force on the magnet due to the induced currents in the superconductor (which is to say, the force due to the image dipole). Set it equal to Mg (where M is the mass of the magnet) to determine the height h at which the magnet will “float.” [Hint: Refer to Prob. 6.3.] (c) The induced current on the surface of the superconductor (the xy plane) can be determined from the boundary condition on the tangential component of B (Eq. 5.76): B = μ0(K × ˆz). Using the field you get from the image configuration, show that K = − 3mrh 2π(r2 + h2)5/2 ˆφ, where r is the distance from the origin. ! Problem 7.49. If a magnetic dipole levitating above an infinite superconducting plane (Prob. 7.48) is free to rotate, what orientation will it adopt, and how high above the surface will it float? Problem 7.50. A perfectly conducting spherical shell of radius a rotates about the z-axis with angular velocity ω, in a uniform magnetic field B = B0ˆz.

Refer to Prob. 7.11 (and use the result of Prob. 5.45): How long does it take a falling circular ring (radius a,mass m, resistance R) to cross the bottom of the magnetic field B, at its (changing) terminal velocity? Problem 7.52. (a) Referring to Prob. 5.55aand Eq. 7.27, show that E = − ∂A ∂t , (7.75) for Faraday-induced electric fields. Check this result by taking the divergence and curl of both sides. 41 W. M. Saslow, Am.J.Phys. 59, 16 (1991). 354 7 Electrodynamics (b) A spherical shell of radius R carries a uniform surface charge σ. It spins about a fixed axis at an angular velocity ω(t) that changes slowly with time. Find the electric field inside and outside the sphere. [Hint: There are two contributions here: the Coulomb field due to the charge, and the Faraday field due to the changing B. Refer to Ex. 5.11.] Problem 7.53. Electrons undergoing cyclotron motion can be sped up by increasing the magnetic field; the accompanying electric field will impart tangential acceleration. This is the principle of the betatron. One would like to keep the radius of the orbit constant during the process. Show that this can be achieved by designing a magnet such that the average field over the area of the orbit is twice the field at the circumference (Fig. 7.57). Assume the electrons start from rest in zero field, and that the apparatus is symmetric about the center of the orbit. (Assume also that the electron velocity remains well below the speed of light, so that nonrelativistic mechanics applies.) [Hint: Differentiate Eq. 5.3 with respect to time, and use F = ma = qE.] Electron orbit B s Fig. 7.57 z y x I v Fig. 7.58 Problem 7.54. An infinite wire carrying a constant current I in the ˆz direction is moving in the y direction at a constant speed v. Find the electric field, in the quasistatic approximation, at the instant the wire coincides with the z-axis (Fig. 7.58). [Answer: −(μ0Iv/2πs) sin φ ˆz.] Problem 7.55. An atomic electron (charge q) circles about the nucleus (charge Q)inanorbit of radius r; the centripetal acceleration is provided, of course, by the Coulomb attraction of opposite charges. Now a small magnetic field dB is slowly turned on, perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. Show that the increase in kinetic energy, dT, imparted by the induced electric field, is just right to sustain circular motion at the same radius r. (That’s why, in my discussion of diamagnetism, I assumed the radius is fixed. See Section 6.1.3 and the references cited there.) Problem 7.56. The current in a long solenoid is increasing linearly with time, so the flux is proportional to t : Φ = αt. Two voltmeters are connected to diametrically opposite points (A and B), together with resistors (R1 and R2), as shown in Fig. 7.59. What is the reading on each voltmeter? Assume that these are ideal voltmeters that draw negligible current (they have huge internal resistance), and that a voltmeter registers − ∫ b a E · dl between the terminals 355 More Problems on Chapter 7 and through the meter.

A circular wire loop (radius r, resistance R) encloses a region of uniform magnetic field, B, perpendicular to its plane. The field (occupying the shaded region in Fig. 7.60) increases linearly with time (B = αt). An ideal voltmeter (infinite internal resistance) is con- nected between points P and Q. QP 90° r V Fig. 7.60 (a) What is the current in the loop? (b) What does the voltmeter read? [Answer: αr2/2.] Problem 7.58. In the discussion of motional emf (Section 7.1.3) I assumed that the wire loop (Fig. 7.10) has a resistance R; the current generated is then I = vBh/R. But what if the wire is made out of perfectly conducting material, so that R is zero? In that case, the current is limited only by the back emf associated with the self-inductance of the loop (which would ordinarily be negligible in comparison with IR). As a model, let’s simply replace the resistor by an inductor, L. Show that in this régime the loop (mass m) executes simple harmonic motion, and find its frequency.43 [Answer: ω = Bh/ √mL.] Problem 7.59. (a) Use the Neumann formula (Eq. 7.32) to calculate the mutual inductance of the configuration in Fig. 7.37, assuming a is very small (a ≪ b, a ≪ z). Compare your answer to Prob. 7.23. 42 See R. H. Romer, Am. J. Phys. 50, 1089 (1982). See also H. W. Nicholson, Am. J. Phys. 73, 1194 (2005); B. H. McGuyer, Am.J.Phys. 80, 101 (2012). 43 For a collection of related problems, see W. M. Saslow, Am.

Two coils are wrapped around a cylindrical form in such a way that the same flux passes through every turn of both coils. (In practice this is achieved by inserting an iron core through the cylinder; this has the effect of concentrating the flux.) The primary coil has N1 turns and the secondary has N2 (Fig. 7.61). If the current I in the primary is changing, show that the emf in the secondary is given by E2 E1 = N2 N1 , (7.76) where E1 is the (back) emf of the primary. [This is a primitive transformer – a device for raising or lowering the emf of an alternating current source. By choosing the appropriate number of turns, any desired secondary emf can be obtained. If you think this violates the conservation of energy, study Prob. 7.61.] Primary (N1 turns) Secondary (N2 turns) Fig. 7.61 Problem 7.61. Atransformer (Prob. 7.60) takes an input AC voltage of amplitude V1,and delivers an output voltage of amplitude V2, which is determined by the turns ratio (V2/V1 = N2/N1). If N2 > N1, the output voltage is greater than the input voltage. Why doesn’t this violate conservation of energy? [Answer: Power is the product of voltage and current; if the voltage goes up, the current must come down. The purpose of this problem is to see exactly how this works out, in a simplified model.] (a) In an ideal transformer, the same flux passes through all turns of the primary and of the secondary. Show that in this case M2 = L1L2,where M is the mutual inductance of the coils, and L1, L2 are their individual self-inductances. (b) Suppose the primary is driven with AC voltage Vin = V1 cos(ωt), and the secondary is connected to a resistor, R. Show that the two currents satisfy the relations 357 More Problems on Chapter 7 L1 dI1 dt + M dI2 dt = V1 cos(ωt), L2 dI2 dt + M dI1 dt = −I2R. (c) Using the result in (a), solve these equations for I1(t) and I2(t). (Assume I1 has no DC component.) (d) Show that the output voltage (Vout = I2R) divided by the input voltage (Vin)isequal to the turns ratio: Vout/Vin = N2/N1. (e) Calculate the input power (Pin = VinI1) and the output power (Pout = VoutI2), and show that their averages over a full cycle are equal. Problem 7.62. An infinite wire runs along the z-axis; it carries a current I (z) that is a function of z (but not of t), and a charge density λ(t) that is a function of t (but not of z). (a) By examining the charge flowing into a segment dz in a time dt, show that dλ/dt = −dI/dz. If we stipulate that λ(0) = 0 and I (0) = 0, show that λ(t) = kt, I (z) = −kz,where k is a constant. (b) Assume for a moment that the process is quasistatic, so the fields are given by Eqs. 2.9 and 5.38. Show that these are in fact the exact fields, by confirming that all four of Maxwell’s equations are satisfied. (First do it in differential form, for the region s > 0,theninintegral form for the appropriate Gaussian cylinder/Ampèrian loop straddling the axis.) Problem 7.63. Suppose J(r) is constant in time but ρ(r, t) is not – conditions that might prevail, for instance, during the charging of a capacitor. (a) Show that the charge density at any particular point is a linear function of time: ρ(r, t) = ρ(r,0) + ˙ρ(r,0)t, where ˙ρ(r,0) is the time derivative of ρ at t = 0.[Hint: Use the continuity equation.] This is not an electrostatic or magnetostatic configuration;44 nevertheless, rather surprisingly, both Coulomb’s law (Eq. 2.8) and the Biot–Savart law (Eq. 5.42) hold, as you can confirm by showing that they satisfy Maxwell’s equations. (b) Show that B(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′) × ˆ 2 dτ′ obeys Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s displacement current term (though J, here, is the ordinary (conduction) current, and does not include the displacement current). Problem 7.64. The magnetic field of an infinite straight wire carrying a steady current I can be obtained from the displacement current term in the Ampère/Maxwell law, as follows: Picture 44 Some authors would regard this as magnetostatic, since B is independent of t. For them, the Biot–Savart law is a general rule of magnetostatics, but ∇ · J = 0and ∇ × B = μ0J apply only under the additional assumption that ρ is constant. In such a formulation, Maxwell’s displacement term can (in this very special case) be derived from the Biot–Savart law, by the method of part (b). See D. F. Bartlett, Am.J.Phys. 58, 1168 (1990); D. J. Griffiths and M. A. Heald, Am.J.Phys. 59, 111 (1991). 358 7 Electrodynamics the current as consisting of a uniform line charge λ moving along the z-axis at speed v (so that I = λv), with a tiny gap of length ϵ, which reaches the origin at time t = 0. In the next instant (up to t = ϵ/v) there is no real current passing through a circular Ampèrian loop in the xy plane, but there is a displacement current, due to the “missing”charge in the gap. (a) Use Coulomb’s law to calculate the z component of the electric field, for points in the xy plane a distance s from the origin, due to a segment of wire with uniform density −λ extending from z1 = vt − ϵ to z2 = vt. (b) Determine the flux of this electric field through a circle of radius a in the xy plane. (c) Find the displacement current through this circle. Show that Id is equal to I, in the limit as the gap width (ϵ)goestozero.45 Problem 7.65. A certain transmission line is constructed from two thin metal “ribbons,” of width w, a very small distance h ≪ w apart. The current travels down one strip and back along the other. In each case, it spreads out uniformly over the surface of the ribbon. (a) Find the capacitance per unit length, C. (b) Find the inductance per unit length, L. (c) What is the product LC, numerically? [The quantities L and C will, of course, vary from one kind of transmission line to another, but their product is a universal constant – check, for example, the cable in Ex. 7.14 – provided the space between the conductors is a vacuum. In the theory of transmission lines, this product is related to the speed with which a pulse propagates down the line: v = 1/ √LC.] (d) If the strips are insulated from one another by a nonconducting material of permittivity ϵ and permeability μ, what then is the product LC? What is the propagation speed? [Hint: See Ex. 4.6;bywhatfactordoes L change when an inductor is immersed in linear material of permeability μ?] Problem 7.66. Two very long coaxial circular solenoids (radii a and 2a)have 4n and n turns per unit length, respectively. They both carry a steady current I, but in opposite directions. (a) What is the magnetic flux through a plane, coaxial, circular loop of radius 5a? (b) Now suppose they are driven by an alternating current, I = I0 cos ωt. In the quasistatic approximation, what is the induced electric field in each region, s < a, a < s < 2a, s > 2a? (c) This changing electric field, in turn, induces a secondary magnetic field, B′. Find this field, for a point on the axis. (d) Compare B′ and B, for points on the axis – what is their ratio? Calculate the actual number, if the frequency is 60 Hz (ordinary household current) and a = 2 cm. Problem 7.67. Alfvén’s theorem states that in a perfectly conducting fluid (say, a gas of free electrons), the magnetic flux through any closed loop moving with the fluid is constant in time. (The magnetic field lines are, as it were, “frozen”into the fluid.) Prove it, as follows: 45 For a slightly different approach to the same problem, see W. K. Terry, Am. J. Phys. 50, 742 (1982). 359 More Problems on Chapter 7 (a) Use Ohm’s law, in the form of Eq. 7.2, together with Faraday’s law, to prove that if σ = ∞ and J is finite, then ∂B ∂t = ∇ × (v × B). v dt Fig. 7.62 (b) Let S be the surface bounded by the loop (P)attime t,and S′ a surface bounded by the loop in its new position (P′)attime t + dt (see Fig. 7.62). The change in flux is dΦ = ∫ S′ B(t + dt) · da − ∫ S B(t) · da. Use ∇ · B = 0 to show that ∫ S′ B(t + dt) · da + ∫ R B(t + dt) · da = ∫ S B(t + dt) · da (where R is the “ribbon”joining P and P′), and hence that dΦ = dt ∫ S ∂B ∂t · da − ∫ R B(t + dt) · da (for infinitesimal dt). Use the method of Section 7.1.3 to rewrite the second integral as dt ∮ P(B × v) · dl, and invoke Stokes’theorem to conclude that dΦ dt = ∫ S ( ∂B ∂t − ∇ × (v × B)) · da. Together with the result in (a), this proves the theorem. Problem 7.68.

Explain.46 46 This problem was suggested by an exchange with Hermann Batelaan. Intermission All of our cards are now on the table, and in a sense my job is done. In the first seven chapters we assembled electrodynamics piece by piece, and now, with Maxwell’s equations in their final form, the theory is complete. There are no more laws to be learned, no further generalizations to be considered, and (with perhaps one exception) no lurking inconsistencies to be resolved. If yours is a one-semester course, this would be a reasonable place to stop. But in another sense we have just arrived at the starting point. We are at last in possession of a full deck – it’s time to deal. This is the fun part, in which one comes to appreciate the extraordinary power and richness of electrodynamics. In a full-year course there should be plenty of time to cover the remaining chapters, and perhaps to supplement them with a unit on plasma physics, say, or AC circuit theory, or even a little general relativity. But if you have room for only one topic, I’d recommend Chapter 9, on elec- tromagnetic waves (you’ll probably want to skim Chapter 8 as preparation). This is the segue to optics, and is historically the most important application of Maxwell’s theory. 8 Conservation Laws 8.1 Charge and Energy 8.1.1 The Continuity Equation In this chapter we study conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum, in electrodynamics. But I want to begin by reviewing the conservation of charge, because it is the paradigm for all conservation laws. What precisely does conservation of charge tell us? That the total charge in the Universe is constant? Well, sure – that’s global conservation of charge. But local conservation of charge is a much stronger statement: if the charge in some region changes, then exactly that amount of charge must have passed in or out through the surface. The tiger can’t simply rematerialize outside the cage; if it got from inside to outside it must have slipped through a hole in the fence. Formally, the charge in a volume V is Q(t) = ∫ V ρ(r, t) dτ, (8.1) and the current flowing out through the boundary S is ∮ S J · da, so local conservation of charge says dQ dt = − ∮ S J · da. (8.2) Using Eq. 8.1 to rewrite the left-hand side, and invoking the divergence theorem on the right, we have ∫ V ∂ρ ∂t dτ = − ∫ V ∇ · J dτ, (8.3) and since this is true for any volume, it follows that ∂ρ ∂t = −∇ · J. (8.4) This is the continuity equation – the precise mathematical statement of local conservation of charge. It can be derived from Maxwell’s equation (take a moment to remind yourself how to do that) – conservation of charge is not an independent assumption; it is built into the laws of electrodynamics. 363 8.1 Charge and Energy It serves as a constraint on the sources (ρ and J). They can’t be just any old functions – they have to respect conservation of charge.1 The purpose of this chapter is to develop the corresponding equations for local conservation of energy and momentum. In the process (and perhaps more important) we will learn how to express the energy density and the momentum density (the analogs to ρ), as well as the energy “current” and the momentum “current” (analogous to J). 8.1.2 Poynting’s Theorem In Chapter 2, we found that the work necessary to assemble a static charge distribution (against the Coulomb repulsion of like charges) is (Eq. 2.45) We = ϵ0 2 ∫ E2 dτ, where E is the resulting electric field. Likewise, the work required to get currents going (against the back emf) is (Eq. 7.44) Wm = 1 2μ0 ∫ B2 dτ, where B is the resulting magnetic field. This suggests that the total energy stored in electromagnetic fields, per unit volume, is u = 1 2 (ϵ0E2 + 1 μ0 B2). (8.5) In this section I will confirm Eq. 8.5, and develop the energy conservation law for electrodynamics. Suppose we have some charge and current configuration which, at time t, produces fields E and B. In the next instant, dt, the charges move around a bit. Question: How much work, dW , is done by the electromagnetic forces acting on these charges, in the interval dt? According to the Lorentz force law, the work done on a charge q is dW = F · dl = q(E + v × B) · v dt = qE · v dt. In terms of the charge and current densities, q → ρ dτ and ρv → J, 2 so the rate at which work is done on all the charges in a volume V is dW dt = ∫ V(E · J) dτ. (8.6) 1 The continuity equation is the only such constraint. Any functions ρ(r, t) and J(r, t) consistent with Eq. 8.4 constitute possible charge and current densities, in the sense of admitting solutions to Maxwell’s equations. 2 Of course, if charges of both signs are present, the net charge density can be zero even when the current is not – in fact, this is the case for ordinary current-carrying wires. We should really treat the positive and negative charges separately, and combine the two to get Eq. 8.6, with J = ρ+v+ + ρ−v−. See Chapter 5, footnote 8. 364 8 Conservation Laws Evidently, E · J is the work done per unit time, per unit volume – which is to say, the power delivered per unit volume. We can express this quantity in terms of the fields alone, using the Ampère–Maxwell law to eliminate J: 3 E · J = 1 μ0 E · (∇ × B) − ϵ0E · ∂E ∂t . Product rule 6 says ∇ · (E × B) = B · (∇ × E) − E · (∇ × B). Invoking Faraday’s law (∇ × E = −∂B/∂t), it follows that E · (∇ × B) = −B · ∂B ∂t − ∇ · (E × B). Meanwhile, B · ∂B ∂t = 1 2 ∂ ∂t (B2) and E · ∂E ∂t = 1 2 ∂ ∂t (E2), (8.7) so E · J = − 1 2 ∂ ∂t (ϵ0E2 + 1 μ0 B2) − 1 μ0 ∇ · (E × B). (8.8) Putting this into Eq. 8.6, and applying the divergence theorem to the second term, we have dW dt = − d dt ∫ V 1 2 (ϵ0E2 + 1 μ0 B2) dτ − 1 μ0 ∮ S(E × B) · da, (8.9) where S is the surface bounding V. This is Poynting’s theorem;itisthe “work-energy theorem” of electrodynamics. The first integral on the right is the total energy stored in the fields, ∫ udτ (Eq. 8.5). The second term evidently represents the rate at which energy is transported out of V, across its boundary surface, by the electromagnetic fields. Poynting’s theorem says, then, that the work done on the charges by the electromagnetic force is equal to the decrease in energy remaining in the fields, less the energy that flowed out through the surface. The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported by the fields is called the Poynting vector: S ≡ 1 μ0 (E × B). (8.10) Specifically, S · da is the energy per unit time crossing the infinitesimal surface da – the energy flux (so S is the energy flux density). 4 We will see 3 As you will discover, this is a standard move in field theory: get rid of the sources (ρ and J) in favor of the fields (E and B), using the field equations (Gauss and Ampère–Maxwell). 4 If you’re very fastidious, you’ll notice a small gap in the logic here: we know from Eq. 8.9 that ∮ S · da is the total power passing through a closed surface, but this does not prove that∫ S · da is the power passing through any open surface (there could be an extra term that integrates to zero over all closed surfaces). This is, however, the obvious and natural interpre- tation; as always, the precise location of energy is not really determined in electrodynamics (see Section 2.4.4). 365 8.1 Charge and Energy many applications of the Poynting vector in Chapters 9 and 11, but for the moment I am mainly interested in using it to express Poynting’s theorem more compactly: dW dt = − d dt ∫ V udτ − ∮ S S · da. (8.11) What if no work is done on the charges in V – what if, for example, V is in a region of empty space, where there is no charge? In that case dW /dt = 0, so ∫ ∂u ∂t dτ = − ∮ S S · da = − ∫ V(∇ · S) dτ, and hence ∂u ∂t = −∇ · S. (8.12) This is the “continuity equation” for energy: u (energy density) plays the role of ρ (charge density), and S takes the part of J (current density). It expresses local conservation of electromagnetic energy. In general, though, electromagnetic energy by itself is not conserved (nor is the mechanical energy of the charges). Of course not! The fields do work on the charges, and the charges create fields – energy is tossed back and forth between them. In the overall energy economy, you must include the contributions of both the matter and the fields. Example 8.1. When current flows down a resistive wire, work is done, which shows up as Joule heating of the wire (Eq. 7.7). Though there are certainly easier ways to do it, the energy per unit time delivered to the wire can be calculated using the Poynting vector. Assuming it’s uniform, the electric field inside the wire is E = V L , where V is the potential difference between the ends and L is the length of the wire (Fig. 8.1). The magnetic field is “circumferential”; at the surface (radius a) it has the value B = μ0I 2πa . Accordingly, the magnitude of the Poynting vector is S = 1 μ0 V L μ0I 2πa = VI 2πaL , and it points radially inward. The energy per unit time passing in through the surface of the wire is therefore ∫ S · da = S(2πaL) = VI, 366 8 Conservation Laws which is exactly what we concluded, on much more direct grounds, in Section 7.1.1.5 L a S B E I Fig. 8.1 Problem 8.1. Calculate the power (energy per unit time) transported down the cables of Ex. 7.14 and Prob. 7.65, assuming the two conductors are held at potential difference V,and carry current I (downoneandbackuptheother). Problem 8.2. Imagine two infinite parallel nonconducting planes, a distance d apart, carry- ing equal and opposite uniform surface charges ±σ. A point charge q is at rest in the space between them, a distance z0 above the −σ surface. The electric field is E = Eσ + Eq.The total field energy is infinite, but the interaction energy (subtracting off the portions due to σ alone and q alone) is finite. (a) Calculate the interaction energy of this configuration. (b) Compare the interaction energy to the potential energy of q (take it to be zero at the center between the planes). (c) From the gradient of the interaction energy determine the force on q (no surprise).6 Problem 8.3. Consider the charging capacitor in Prob. 7.35. (a) Find the electric and magnetic fields in the gap, as functions of the distance s from the axis and the time t.(Assume thechargeiszeroat t = 0.) (b) Find the energy density uem and the Poynting vector S in the gap. Note especially the direction of S.Checkthat Eq. 8.12 is satisfied. (c) Determine the total energy in the gap, as a function of time. Calculate the total power flowing into the gap, by integrating the Poynting vector over the appropriate surface. Check that the power input is equal to the rate of increase of energy in the gap (Eq. 8.9 –inthis case W = 0, because there is no charge in the gap). [If you’re worried about the fringing fields, do it for a volume of radius b < a well inside the gap.] 5 What about energy flow down the wire? For a discussion, see M. K. Harbola, Am.J.Phys. 78, 1203 (2010). For a more sophisticated geometry, see B. S. Davis and L. Kaplan, Am. J. Phys. 79, 1155 (2011). 6 For commentary, see R. C. Hilborn, Am.J.Phys. 84, 531 (2016). 367 8.2 Momentum Problem 8.4. For the charging sphere in Prob. 7.38: (a) find the Poynting vector; (b) find the energy density in the fields; (c) check that the electromagnetic energy is locally conserved (Eq. 8.12), except on the negative z-axis; (d) on the negative z-axis, however, external work is being done on the current – pushing the charges in against the electric field. Calculate the external power delivered, and show that it is equal to the rate of increase of the energy in the fields.7 8.2 Momentum 8.2.1 Newton’s Third Law in Electrodynamics Imagine a point charge q traveling in along the x-axis at a constant speed v. Because it is moving, its electric field is not given by Coulomb’s law; nevertheless, E still points radially outward from the instantaneous position of the charge (Fig. 8.2a), as we’ll see in Chapter 10. Since, moreover, a moving point charge does not constitute a steady current, its magnetic field is not given by the Biot–Savart law. Nevertheless, it’s a fact that B still circles around the axis in a manner suggested by the right-hand rule (Fig. 8.2b); again, the proof will come in Chapter 10. Now suppose this charge encounters an identical one, proceeding in at the same speed along the y-axis. Of course, the electromagnetic force between them would tend to drive them off the axes, but let’s assume that they’re mounted on tracks, or something, so they’re obliged to maintain the same direction and the same speed (Fig. 8.3). The electric force between them is repulsive, but how about the magnetic force? Well, the magnetic field of q1 points into the page (at the position of q2), so the magnetic force E B v x v x (a) (b) Fig. 8.2 7 T. H. Boyer, Am.J.Phys. 87, 729 (2019). 368 8 Conservation Laws x y z B1 q1 q2 Fm Fm Fe v2 FeB2 v1 Fig. 8.3 on q2 is toward the right, whereas the magnetic field of q2 is out of the page (at the position of q1), and the magnetic force on q1 is upward. The net electromagnetic force of q1 on q2 is equal but not opposite to the force of q2 on q1, in violation of Newton’s third law.Inelectrostatics and magnetostatics the third law holds, but in electrodynamics it does not. Well, that’s an interesting curiosity, but then, how often does one actually use the third law, in practice? Answer: All the time! For the proof of conservation of momentum rests on the cancelation of internal forces, which follows from the third law. When you tamper with the third law, you are placing conservation of momentum in jeopardy, and there is hardly any principle in physics more sacred than that. Momentum conservation is rescued, in electrodynamics, by the real- ization that the fields themselves carry momentum. This is not so sur- prising when you consider that we have already attributed energy to the fields. Whatever momentum is lost to the particles is gained by the fields. Only when the field momentum is added to the mechanical momentum is momentum conservation restored. 8.2.2 Maxwell’s Stress Tensor Let’s calculate the total electromagnetic force on the charges in volume V: F = ∫ V(E + v × B)ρ dτ = ∫ V(ρE + J × B) dτ. (8.13) The force per unit volume is f = ρE + J × B. (8.14) As before, I propose to express this in terms of fields alone, eliminating ρ and J by using Maxwell’s equations (i) and (iv): f = ϵ0(∇ · E)E + ( 1 μ0 ∇ × B − ϵ0 ∂E ∂t ) × B. Now ∂ ∂t (E × B) = ( ∂E ∂t × B) + (E × ∂B ∂t ), 369 8.2 Momentum and Faraday’s law says ∂B ∂t = −∇ × E, so ∂E ∂t × B = ∂ ∂t (E × B) + E × (∇ × E). Thus f = ϵ0[(∇ · E)E − E × (∇ × E)] − 1 μ0 [B × (∇ × B)] − ϵ0 ∂ ∂t (E × B). (8.15) Just to make things look more symmetrical, let’s throw in a term (∇ · B)B; since ∇ · B = 0, this costs us nothing. Meanwhile, product rule 4says ∇(E2) = 2(E · ∇)E + 2E × (∇ × E), so E × (∇ × E) = 1 2 ∇(E2) − (E · ∇)E, and the same goes for B. Therefore, f = ϵ0[(∇ · E)E + (E · ∇)E] + 1 μ0 [(∇ · B)B + (B · ∇)B] − 1 2 ∇(ϵ0E2 + 1 μ0 B2) − ϵ0 ∂ ∂t (E × B). (8.16) Ugly! But it can be simplified by introducing the Maxwell stress tensor, Tij ≡ ϵ0 (EiEj − 1 2 δijE2) + 1 μ0 (BiBj − 1 2 δijB2). (8.17) The indices i and j refer to the coordinates x, y,and z, so the stress tensor has a total of nine components (Txx, Tyy, Txz, Tyx, and so on). The Kronecker delta, δij, is 1 if the indices are the same (δxx = δyy = δzz = 1) and 0 otherwise (δxy = δxz = δyz = 0). Thus Txx = 1 2 ϵ0(E2 x − E2 y − E2 z ) + 1 2μ0 (B2 x − B2 y − B2 z ), Txy = ϵ0(ExEy) + 1 μ0 (BxBy), and so on. Because it carries two indices, where a vector has only one, Tij is some- times written with a double arrow: ←→ T . One can form the dot product of ←→ T with a vector a, in two ways – on the left, and on the right: (a · ←→ T ) j = ∑ i=x,y,z aiTij, (←→ T · a) j = ∑ i=x,y,z Tjiai. (8.18) The resulting object, which has one remaining index, is itself a vector. In particular, the divergence of ←→ T has, as its jth component, 370 8 Conservation Laws (∇ · ←→ T ) j = ϵ0 [(∇ · E)Ej + (E · ∇)Ej − 1 2 ∇jE2] + 1 μ0 [(∇ · B)Bj + (B · ∇)Bj − 1 2 ∇jB2]. Thus the force per unit volume (Eq. 8.16) can be written in the much tidier form f = ∇ · ←→ T − ϵ0μ0 ∂S ∂t , (8.19) where S is the Poynting vector (Eq. 8.10). The total electromagnetic force on the charges in V (Eq. 8.13)is F = ∮ S ←→ T · da − ϵ0μ0 d dt ∫ V S dτ. (8.20) (I used the divergence theorem to convert the first term to a surface inte- gral.) In the static case the second term drops out, and the electromagnetic force on the charge configuration can be expressed entirely in terms of the stress tensor at the boundary: F = ∮ S ←→ T · da (static). (8.21) Physically, ←→ T is the force per unit area (or stress) acting on the surface. More precisely, Tij is the force (per unit area) in the ith direction acting on an element of surface oriented in the jth direction – “diagonal” elements (Txx, Tyy, Tzz) represent pressure, and “off-diagonal” elements (Txy, Txz, etc.) are shears. Example 8.2. Determine the net force on the “northern” hemisphere of a (stationary) uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and charge Q (the same as Prob. 2.48, only this time we’ll use the Maxwell stress tensor and Eq. 8.21). Solution. The boundary surface consists of two parts – a hemispher- ical “bowl” at radius R, and a circular disk at θ = π/2 (Fig. 8.4). For the bowl, da = R2 sin θ dθ dφ ˆr y x z Disk Bowl Fig. 8.4 371 8.2 Momentum and E = 1 4πϵ0 Q R2 ˆr. In Cartesian components, ˆr = sin θ cos φ ˆx + sin θ sin φ ˆy + cos θ ˆz, so Tzx = ϵ0EzEx = ϵ0 ( Q 4πϵ0R2 ) 2 sin θ cos θ cos φ, Tzy = ϵ0EzEy = ϵ0 ( Q 4πϵ0R2 ) 2 sin θ cos θ sin φ, Tzz = ϵ0 2 (E2 z − E2 x − E2 y ) = ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0R2 ) 2(cos2 θ − sin2 θ). (8.22) The net force is obviously in the z direction, so it suffices to calculate (←→ T ·da) z = Tzx dax+Tzy day+Tzz daz = ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0R ) 2 sin θ cos θ dθ dφ. The force on the “bowl” is therefore Fbowl = ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0R ) 22π ∫ π/2 0 sin θ cos θ dθ = 1 4πϵ0 Q 2 8R2 . (8.23) Meanwhile, for the equatorial disk, da = −rdrdφ ˆz, (8.24) and (since we are now inside the sphere) E = 1 4πϵ0 Q R3 r = 1 4πϵ0 Q R3 r(cos φ ˆx + sin φ ˆy). Thus Tzz = ϵ0 2 (E2 z − E2 x − E2 y ) = − ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0R3 ) 2r 2, and hence (←→ T · da) z = ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0R3 ) 2r 3 dr dφ. The force on the disk is therefore Fdisk = ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0R3 ) 22π ∫ R 0 r 3 dr = 1 4πϵ0 Q 2 16R2 . (8.25) Combining Eqs. 8.23 and 8.25, I conclude that the net force on the northern hemisphere is F = 1 4πϵ0 3Q 2 16R2 . (8.26) Incidentally, in applying Eq. 8.21, any volume that encloses all of the charge in question (and no other charge) will do the job. For 372 8 Conservation Laws example, in the present case we could use the whole region z > 0. In that case the boundary surface consists of the entire xy plane (plus a hemisphere at r = ∞,but E = 0 out there, so it contributes nothing). In place of the “bowl,” we now have the outer portion of the plane (r > R). Here, Tzz = − ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0 ) 2 1 r4 (Eq. 8.22 with θ = π/2 and R → r), and da is given by Eq. 8.24,so (←→ T · da) z = ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0 ) 2 1 r3 dr dφ, and the contribution from the plane for r > R is ϵ0 2 ( Q 4πϵ0 ) 22π ∫ ∞ R 1 r3 dr = 1 4πϵ0 Q 2 8R2 , the same as for the bowl (Eq. 8.23). I hope you didn’t get too bogged down in the details of Ex. 8.2.If so, take a moment to appreciate what happened. We were calculating the force on a solid object, but instead of doing a volume integral, as you might expect, Eq. 8.21 allowed us to set it up as a surface integral; somehow the stress tensor sniffs out what is going on inside. ! Problem 8.5. Calculate the force of magnetic attraction between the northern and southern hemispheres of a uniformly charged spinning spherical shell, with radius R, angular velocity ω, and surface charge density σ. [This is the same as Prob. 5.47, but this time use the Maxwell stress tensor and Eq. 8.21.] Problem 8.6. (a) Consider two equal point charges q, separated by a distance 2a.Construct theplane equidistant from the two charges. By integrating Maxwell’s stress tensor over this plane, determine the force of one charge on the other. (b) Do the same for charges that are opposite in sign. 8.2.3 Conservation of Momentum According to Newton’s second law, the force on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum: F = dpmech dt . Equation 8.20 can therefore be written in the form8 8 Let’s assume the only forces acting are electromagnetic. You can include other forces if you like – both here and in the discussion of energy conservation – but they are just a distraction from the essential story. 373 8.2 Momentum dpmech dt = −ϵ0μ0 d dt ∫ V S dτ + ∮ S ←→ T · da, (8.27) where pmech is the (mechanical) momentum (∑ mivi) of the particles in volume V. 9 This expression is similar in structure to Poynting’s theorem (Eq. 8.11), and it invites an analogous interpretation: the first integral represents momentum stored in the fields, p = μ0ϵ0 ∫ V S dτ, (8.28) while the second integral is the momentum per unit time flowing in through the surface. Equation 8.27 is the statement of conservation of momentum in electro- dynamics: if the mechanical momentum increases, either the field momen- tum decreases, or else the fields are carrying momentum into the volume through the surface. The momentum density in the fields is evidently g = μ0ϵ0S = ϵ0(E × B), (8.29) and the momentum flux transported by the fields is − ←→ T (more precisely, − ←→ T · da is the electromagnetic momentum per unit time passing through the area da). If the mechanical momentum in V is not changing (for example, if we are talking about a region of empty space), then ∫ ∂g ∂t dτ = ∮ ←→ T · da = ∫ ∇ · ←→ T dτ, and hence ∂g ∂t = ∇ · ←→ T . (8.30) This is the “continuity equation” for electromagnetic momentum, with g (momentum density) in the role of ρ (charge density) and − ←→ T playing the part of J. Equation 8.30 expresses the local conservation of field momen- tum. But in general (when there are charges around) the field momentum by itself, and the mechanical momentum by itself, are not conserved – charges and fields exchange momentum, and only the total is conserved. Notice that the Poynting vector has appeared in two quite different roles: S itself is the energy per unit area, per unit time, transported by the electromagnetic fields, while μ0ϵ0S is the momentum per unit volume stored in those fields.10 Similarly, ←→ T plays a dual role: ←→ T itself is the electromagnetic stress (force per unit area) acting on a surface, and − ←→ T describes the flow of momentum (it is the momentum current density) carried by the fields. 9 Again, to avoid distracting complications I assume no particles enter or leave V. 10 This is no coincidence – see R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 2, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1964), Sect. 27-6. 374 8 Conservation Laws Example 8.3. A long resistanceless coaxial cable, of length l, consists of an inner conductor (radius a) and an outer conductor (radius b). It is connected to a battery at one end and a resistor at the other (Fig. 8.5). The inner conductor carries a uniform charge per unit length λ,and asteadycurrent I to the right; the outer conductor has the opposite charge and current. What is the electromagnetic momentum stored in the fields? \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 I I I l V a b \u0002 \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0002 z R Fig. 8.5 Solution. The fields are E = 1 2πϵ0 λ s ˆs, B = μ0 2π I s ˆφ. The Poynting vector is therefore S = λI 4π2ϵ0s2 ˆz. So energy is flowing down the line, from the battery to the resistor. In fact, the power transported is P = ∫ S · da = λI 4π2ϵ0 ∫ b a 1 s2 2πsds = λI 2πϵ0 ln(b/a) = IV , as it should be. The momentum in the fields is p = μ0ϵ0 ∫ S dτ = μ0λI 4π2 ˆz ∫ b a 1 s2 l2πsds = μ0λIl 2π ln(b/a)ˆz = ϵ0μ0IVlˆz. This is an astonishing result. The cable is not moving, E and B are static, and yet we are asked to believe that there is momentum in the fields. If something tells you this cannot be the whole story, you have sound intuitions. But the resolution of this paradox will have to await Chapter 12 (Ex. 12.12). Suppose now that we turn up the resistance, so the current decreases. The changing magnetic field will induce an electric field (Eq. 7.29): E = [ μ0 2π dI dt ln s + K ]ˆz. 375 8.2 Momentum This field exerts a force on ±λ: F = λl [ μ0 2π dI dt ln a + K ]ˆz − λl [ μ0 2π dI dt ln b + K ]ˆz = − μ0λl 2π dI dt ln(b/a)ˆz. The total momentum imparted to the cable, as the current drops from I to 0, is therefore pmech = ∫ F dt = μ0λIl 2π ln(b/a)ˆz, which is precisely the momentum originally stored in the fields. Problem 8.7. Imagine two parallel infinite sheets, carrying uniform surface charge +σ (on the sheet at z = d)and −σ (at z = 0). They are moving in the y direction at constant speed v (as in Prob. 5.18). (a) What is the electromagnetic momentum in a region of area A? (b) Now suppose the top sheet moves slowly down (speed u) until it reaches the bottom sheet, so the fields disappear. By calculating the total force on the charge (q = σA), show that the impulse delivered to the sheet is equal to the momentum originally stored in the fields. [Hint: As the upper plate passes by, the magnetic field drops to zero, inducing an electric field that delivers an impulse to the lower plate.] Problem 8.8. A charged parallel-plate capacitor (with uniform electric field E = Eˆz)is placed in a uniform magnetic field B = Bˆx, as shown in Fig. 8.6. (a) Find the electromagnetic momentum in the space between the plates. (b) Now a resistive wire is connected between the plates, along the z-axis, so that the capacitor slowly discharges. The current through the wire will experience a magnetic force; what is the total impulse delivered to the system, during the discharge?11 z y x d B A E E B Fig. 8.6 Problem 8.9. Consider an infinite parallel-plate capacitor, with the lower plate (at z = −d/2) carrying surface charge density −σ, and the upper plate (at z =+d/2)carryingcharge density +σ. 11 There is much more to be said about this problem, so don’t get too excited if your answers to (a) and (b) appear to be consistent. See D. Babson et al., Am.J.Phys. 77, 826 (2009). 376 8 Conservation Laws (a) Determine all nine elements of the stress tensor, in the region between the plates. Display your answer as a 3 × 3 matrix: \u0003\u0004\u0004 \u0005 Txx Txy Txz Tyx Tyy Tyz Tzx Tzy Tzz \u0006\u0007\u0007 \b . (b) Use Eq. 8.21 to determine the electromagnetic force per unit area on the top plate. Compare Eq. 2.51. (c) What is the electromagnetic momentum per unit area, per unit time, crossing the xy plane (or any other plane parallel to that one, between the plates)? (d) Of course, there must be mechanical forces holding the plates apart – perhaps the capacitor is filled with insulating material under pressure. Suppose we suddenly remove the insulator; the momentum flux (c) is now absorbed by the plates, and they begin to move. Find the momentum per unit time delivered to the top plate (which is to say, the force acting on it) and compare your answer to (b). [Note: This is not an additional force, but rather an alternative way of calculating the same force – in (b) we got it from the force law, and in (d) we do it by conservation of momentum.] 8.2.4 Angular Momentum By now, the electromagnetic fields (which started out as mediators of forces between charges) have taken on a life of their own. They carry energy (Eq. 8.5) u = 1 2 (ϵ0E2 + 1 μ0 B2), (8.31) and momentum (Eq. 8.29) g = ϵ0(E × B), (8.32) and, for that matter, angular momentum ℓ = r × g = ϵ0[r × (E × B)]. (8.33) Even perfectly static fields can harbor momentum and angular momentum, as long as E × B is nonzero, and it is only when these field contributions are included that the conservation laws are sustained. Example 8.4. Imagine a very long solenoid with radius R, n turns per unit length, and current I. Coaxial with the solenoid are two long cylindrical (nonconducting) shells of length l – one, inside the solenoid at radius a, carries a charge +Q, uniformly distributed over its surface; the other, outside the solenoid at radius b, carries charge −Q (see Fig. 8.7; l is supposed to be much greater than b). When the current in the solenoid is gradually reduced, the cylinders begin to rotate, as 377 8.2 Momentum z R lb \u0004Q \u0002Q I a φˆ Fig. 8.7 we found in Ex. 7.9. Question: Where does the angular momentum come from? 12 Solution. It was initially stored in the fields. Before the current was switched off, there was an electric field, E = Q 2πϵ0l 1 s ˆs (a < s < b), in the region between the cylinders, and a magnetic field, B = μ0nIˆz (s < R), inside the solenoid. The momentum density (Eq. 8.29) was therefore g = − μ0nIQ 2πls ˆφ, in the region a < s < R.The z component of the angular momentum density was (r × g)z = − μ0nIQ 2πl , which is constant (independent of s). To get the total angular momen- tum in the fields, we simply multiply by the volume, π(R 2 − a 2)l: 13 L = − 1 2 μ0nIQ(R2 − a 2)ˆz. (8.34) When the current is turned off, the changing magnetic field induces a circumferential electric field, given by Faraday’s law: 12 This is a variation on the “Feynman disk paradox” (R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 2, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1964), pp. 17-5) suggested by F. L. Boos, Jr., Am. J. Phys. 52, 756 (1984). A similar model was proposed earlier by R. H. Romer, Am. J. Phys. 34, 772 (1966). For further references, see T.-C.E.Ma, Am.J.Phys. 54, 949 (1986). 13 The radial component integrates to zero, by symmetry. 378 8 Conservation Laws E = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ − 1 2 μ0n dI dt R2 s ˆφ (s > R), − 1 2 μ0n dI dt s ˆφ (s < R). Thus the torque on the outer cylinder is Nb = r × (−QE) = 1 2 μ0nQR2 dI dt ˆz, and it picks up an angular momentum Lb = 1 2 μ0nQR2ˆz ∫ 0 I dI dt dt = − 1 2 μ0nIQR2ˆz. Similarly, the torque on the inner cylinder is Na = − 1 2 μ0nQa 2 dI dt ˆz, and its angular momentum increase is La = 1 2 μ0nIQa 2ˆz. So it all works out: Lem = La + Lb. The angular momentum lost by the fields is precisely equal to the angular momentum gained by the cylinders, and the total angular momentum (fields plus matter) is conserved. Caution: Field energy does not obey the superposition principle – the energy of a composite system is not the sum of the energies of its constituent parts. That’s because energy (Eq. 8.5)is quadratic in E and B. The fields themselves do satisfy the superposition principle, so, for instance, E = E1 + E2, and hence the electric part of the energy density is u = 1 2 ϵ0(E · E) = 1 2 ϵ0(E2 1 + E2 2 + 2E1 · E2) = u1 + u2 + ϵ0E1 · E2. The cross term spoils it. To take a trivial example, imagine a sphere of charge Q; the same sphere with double the charge would have twice the field,but four times the energy. And the same goes for the Poynting vector, momentum, angular momentum, and the stress tensor, since these are all quadratic in the fields. Problem 8.10. In Ex. 8.4, suppose that instead of turning off the magnetic field (by reducing I)weturnoffthe electric field, by connecting a weakly14 conducting radial spoke between the cylinders. (We’ll have to cut a slot in the solenoid, so the cylinders can still rotate freely.) From the magnetic force on the current in the spoke, determine the total angular momentum 14 In Ex. 8.4 we turned the current off slowly, to keep things quasistatic; here we reduce the electric field slowly to keep the displacement current negligible. 379 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work delivered to the cylinders, as they discharge (they are now rigidly connected, so they rotate together). Compare the initial angular momentum stored in the fields (Eq. 8.34). (Notice that the mechanism by which angular momentum is transferred from the fields to the cylinders is entirely different in the two cases: in Ex. 8.4 it wasFaraday’s law, buthereitisthe Lorentzforce law.) Problem 8.11. Two concentric spherical shells carry uniformly distributed charges +Q (at radius a)and −Q (at radius b > a). They are immersed in a uniform magnetic field B = B0ˆz. (a) Find the angular momentum of the fields (with respect to the center). (b) Now the magnetic field is gradually turned off. Find the torque on each sphere, and the resulting angular momentum of the system. ! Problem 8.12.15 Imagine an iron sphere of radius R that carries a charge Q and a uniform magnetization M = Mˆz. The sphere is initially at rest. (a) Compute the angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic fields. (b) Suppose the sphere is gradually (and uniformly) demagnetized (perhaps by heating it up past the Curie point). Use Faraday’s law to determine the induced electric field, find the torque this field exerts on the sphere, and calculate the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere in the course of the demagnetization. (c) Suppose instead of demagnetizing the sphere we discharge it, by connecting a grounding wire to the north pole. Assume the current flows over the surface in such a way that the (surface) charge density remains uniform. Use the Lorentz force law to determine the torque on the sphere, and calculate the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere in the course of the discharge. (The magnetic field is discontinuous at the surface … does this matter?) [Answer: 2 9 μ0MQR2.] 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work This 16 is perhaps a good place to revisit the old paradox that magnetic forces do no work (Eq. 5.11). What about that magnetic crane lifting the carcass of a junked car? Somebody is doing work on the car, and if it’s not the magnetic field, who is it? The car is ferromagnetic; in the presence of the magnetic field, it contains a lot of microscopic magnetic dipoles (spinning electrons, actually), all lined up. The resulting magnetization is equivalent to a bound current running around the surface, so let’s model the car as a circular current loop. 15 This version of the Feynman disk paradox was proposed by N. L. Sharma, Am.J.Phys. 56, 420 (1988); similar models were analyzed by E. M. Pugh and G. E. Pugh, Am.J.Phys. 35, 153 (1967) and by R. H. Romer, Am.J.Phys. 35, 445 (1967). 16 This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. I include it for those readers who are disturbed by the notion that magnetic forces do no work. 380 8 Conservation Laws Example 8.5. Picture the current loop as a nonconducting ring, of line charge λ, rotating at angular velocity ω (Fig. 8.8). The upward magnetic force on the loop is (Eq. 6.2) F = 2πIaBs, (8.35) where Bs is the radial component of the magnet’s field,17 and I = λωa. If the ring rises a distance dz (while the magnet itself stays put), the work done on it is dW = 2πa 2λωBs dz. (8.36) This increases the potential energy of the ring. Who did the work? Naïvely, it appears that the magnetic field is responsible, but we have already learned (Ex. 5.3) that this is not the case – as the ring rises, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the net velocity of the charges in the ring, so it does no work on them. At the same time, however, a motional emf is induced in the ring, which opposes the flow of charge, and hence reduces its angular velocity: E = − dΦ dt . Here dΦ is the flux through the “ribbon” joining the ring at time t to the ring at time t + dt (Fig. 8.9): dΦ = Bs2πadz. Now E = ∮ f · dl = f (2πa), where f is the force per unit charge. So f = −Bs dz dt , (8.37) the force on a segment of length dl is f λ dl, the torque on the ring is N = a(−Bs dz dt ) λ(2πa), Magnet B aλ w Fig. 8.8 17 Note that the field has to be nonuniform, or it won’t lift the car at all. Also, stipulate for now that the magnetic field remains constant as the loop rises. 381 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work dz Fig. 8.9 and the work done (slowing the rotation) is Ndφ = Nω dt,or dW = −2πa 2λωBs dz. (8.38) The ring slows down, and the rotational energy it loses (Eq. 8.38) is precisely equal to the potential energy it gains (Eq. 8.36). All the magnetic field did was convert energy from one form to another. If you’ll permit some sloppy language, the work done by the vertical component of the magnetic force (Eq. 8.35) is equal and opposite to the work done by its horizontal component (Eq. 8.37).18 Example 8.6. What about the magnet? Is it completely passive in this process? Suppose we model it as a big circular loop (radius b), resting on a table and carrying a current Ib; the “junk car” is a relatively small current loop (radius a), on the floor directly below, carrying a current Ia (Fig. 8.10). This time, just for a change, let’s assume both currents are constant (we’ll include a regulated power supply in each loop 19). Parallel currents attract, and we propose to lift the small loop off the floor, keeping careful track of the work done and the agency responsible. Let’s start by adjusting the currents so the small ring just “floats,” a distance h below the table, with the magnetic force exactly balancing the weight (mag) of the little ring. I’ll let you calculate the magnetic force (Prob. 8.13): b Ib Ia h a Fig. 8.10 18 This argument is essentially the same as the one in Ex. 5.3, except that in this case I told the story in terms of motional emf, instead of the Lorentz force law. But after all, the flux rule is a consequence of the Lorentz force law. 19 The lower loop could be a single spinning electron, in which case quantum mechanics fixes its angular momentum at ℏ/2. It might appear that this sustains the current, with no need for a power supply. I will return to this point, but for now let’s just keep quantum mechanics out of it. 382 8 Conservation Laws Fmag = 3π 2 μ0IaIb a 2b 2h (b2 + h2)5/2 = mag. (8.39) Now the loop rises an infinitesimal distance dz; the work done is equal to the gain in its potential energy dWg = magdz = 3π 2 μ0IaIb a 2b 2h (b2 + h2)5/2 dz. (8.40) Who did it? The magnetic field? No! The work was done by the power supply that sustains the current in loop a (Ex. 5.3). As the loop rises, a motional emf is induced in it. The flux through the loop is Φa = MIb, where M is the mutual inductance of the two loops: M = πμ0 2 a 2b 2 (b2 + h2)3/2 (Prob. 7.23). The emf is Ea = − dΦa dt = −Ib dM dt = −Ib dM dh dh dt = −Ib (− 3 2 ) πμ0 2 a 2b 2 (b2 + h2)5/2 2h (−dz) dt . The work done by the power supply (fighting against this motional emf) is dWa = −EaIa dt = 3π 2 μ0IaIb a 2b 2h (b2 + h2)5/2 dz (8.41) – the same as the work done in lifting the loop (Eq. 8.40). Meanwhile, however, a Faraday emf is induced in the upper loop, due to the changing flux from the lower loop: Φb = MIa ⇒ Eb = −Ia dM dt , and the work done by the power supply in ring b (to sustain the current Ib)is dWb = −EbIb dt = 3π 2 μ0IaIb a 2b 2h (b2 + h2)5/2 dz, (8.42) exactly the same as dWa. That’s embarrassing – the power supplies have done twice as much work as was necessary to lift the junk car! Where did the “wasted” energy go? Answer: It increased the energy stored in the fields. The energy in a system of two current-carrying loops is (see Prob. 8.14) U = 1 2 LaI 2 a + 1 2 LbI 2 b + MIaIb, (8.43) so dU = IaIb dM dt dt = dWb. 383 8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work Remarkably, all four energy increments are the same. If we care to apportion things this way, the power supply in loop a contributes the energy necessary to lift the lower ring, while the power supply in loop b provides the extra energy for the fields. If all we’re interested in is the work done to raise the ring, we can ignore the upper loop (and the energy in the fields) altogether. Example 8.7. In both these models, the magnet itself was stationary. That’s like lifting a paper clip by holding a magnet over it. But in the case of the magnetic crane, the car stays in contact with the magnet, which is attached to a cable that lifts the whole works. As a model, we might stick the upper loop in a big box, the lower loop in a little box, and crank up the currents so the force of attraction is much greater than mag; the two boxes snap together, and we attach a string to the upper box and pull up on it (Fig. 8.11). The same old mechanism (Ex. 5.3) prevails: as the lower loop rises, the magnetic force tilts backward; its vertical component lifts the loop, but its horizontal component opposes the current, and no net work is done. This time, however, the motional emf is perfectly balanced by the Faraday emf fighting to keep the current going – the flux through the lower loop is not changing. (If you like, the flux is increasing because the loop is moving upward, into a region of higher magnetic field, butitis decreasing because the magnetic field of the upper loop – at any given point in space – is decreasing as that loop moves up. See Prob. 7.69.) No power supply is needed to sustain the current (and for that matter, no power supply is required in the upper loop either, since the energy in the fields is not changing). Who did the work to lift the car? The person pulling up on the rope, obviously. The role of the magnetic field was merely to transmit this energy to the car, via the vertical component of the magnetic force. But the magnetic field itself (as always) did no work. Fig. 8.11 The fact that magnetic forces do no work follows directly from the Lorentz force law, so if you think you have discovered an exception, you’re going to have to explain why that law is incorrect. For example, if magnetic 384 8 Conservation Laws monopoles exist, the force on a particle with electric charge qe and magnetic charge qm becomes (Prob. 7.40) F = qe(E + v × B) + qm(B − ϵ0μ0v × E). (8.44) In that case, magnetic fields can do work … but only on magnetic charges.So unless your car is made of monopoles (I don’t think so), this doesn’t solve the problem. A somewhat less radical possibility is that in addition to electric charges there exist permanent point magnetic dipoles (electrons?), whose dipole moment mi is not associated with any electric current, but simply is.The Lorentz force law would then acquire an extra term F = q(E + v × B) + ∇(mi · B). The magnetic field could do work on these “intrinsic” dipoles (which experience no motional or Faraday emf, since they enclose no flux). I don’t know whether a consistent theory can be constructed in this way,20 but in any event it is not classical electrodynamics, which is predicated on Ampère’s assumption that all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion – and point magnetic dipoles must be interpreted as the limits of tiny current loops. Of course, the real world does include particles with intrinsic spin, but they are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, not classical mechan- ics. You can ask, if you like, whether quantum electrodynamics allows magnetic forces to do work. Unfortunately, this is not an easy question to address; “force” and “work” are not concepts that arise naturally in quantum mechanics. In classical electrodynamics, though, the answer is unequivocal: magnetic forces do no work. Period. Problem 8.13. Derive Eq. 8.39.[Hint: Treat the lower loop as a magnetic dipole.] Problem 8.14. Derive Eq. 8.43.[Hint: Use the method of Section 7.2.4, building the two cur- rents up from zero to their final values.] More Problems on Chapter 8 Problem 8.15.21 A very long solenoid of radius a, with n turns per unit length, carries a current Is. Coaxial with the solenoid, at radius b ≫ a, is a circular ring of wire, with resistance R.When the current in the solenoid is (gradually) decreased, a current Ir is induced in the ring. (a) Calculate Ir,intermsof dIs/dt. 20 Semiclassical theories of intrinsic spin (and the associated intrinsic magnetic dipole moment) have been proposed from time to time – see, for example, J. Barandes, Found. Phys. 51, 79 (2021). They tend to be cumbersome and implausible, but never mind: this is certainly something worth exploring. 21 For extensive discussion, see M. A. Heald, Am. J. Phys. 56, 540 (1988). 385 More Problems on Chapter 8 (b) Find the induced electric field as a function of s (the distance from the axis), and use this result to determine the work per unit time it does on the ring. Check that P = I 2 r R.22 (c) The power delivered to the ring must come from the solenoid. Confirm this by calculating the Poynting vector just outside the solenoid (the electric field is due to the changing flux in the solenoid; the magnetic field is due to the current in the ring). Integrate over the entire surface of the solenoid, and check that you recover the correct total power. Problem 8.16. An infinitely long cylindrical tube, of radius a, moves at constant speed v along its axis. It carries a net charge per unit length λ, uniformly distributed over its surface. Surrounding it, at radius b, is another cylinder, moving with the same velocity but carrying the opposite charge (−λ). Find: (a) the energy per unit length stored in the fields; (b) the momentum per unit length in the fields; (c) the energy per unit time transported by the fields across a plane perpendicular to the cylinders. Problem 8.17. A point charge q is located at the center of a toroidal coil of rectangular cross section, inner radius a, outer radius a + w, and height h, which carries a total of N tightly wound turns and current I. (a) Find the electromagnetic momentum p of this configuration, assuming that w and h are both much less than a (so you can ignore the variation of the fields over the cross section). (b) Now the current in the toroid is turned off, quickly enough that the point charge does not move appreciably as the magnetic field drops to zero. Show that the impulse imparted to q is equal to the momentum originally stored in the electromagnetic fields.

Find the electromagnetic momentum of this configuration.

(a) Calculate the total energy contained in the electromagnetic fields. (b) Calculate the total angular momentum contained in the fields. (c) According to the Einstein formula (E = mc2), the energy in the fields should contribute to the mass of the electron. Lorentz and others speculated that the entire mass of the electron might be accounted for in this way: Uem = mec2.Suppose,moreover,thattheelectron’s spin angular momentum is entirely attributable to the electromagnetic fields: Lem = ℏ/2. 22 This part was suggested by Sami Al-Jaber. 23 For an interesting discussion and references, see R. H. Romer, Am. J. Phys. 63, 777 (1995). 24 See J. Higbie, Am.J.Phys. 56, 378 (1988). 386 8 Conservation Laws On these two assumptions, determine the radius and angular velocity of the electron. What is their product, ωR? Does this classical model make sense? Problem 8.20. Work out the formulas for u, S, g,and ←→ T in the presence of magnetic charge. [Hint: Start with the generalized Maxwell equations (Eq. 7.53)and Lorentzforcelaw(Eq. 8.44), and follow the derivations in Sections 8.1.2, 8.2.2,and 8.2.3.] ! Problem 8.21.25 Suppose you had an electric charge qe and a magnetic monopole qm.The field of the electric charge is E = 1 4πϵ0 qe 2 ˆ (of course), and the field of the magnetic monopole is B = μ0 4π qm 2 ˆ. Find the total angular momentum stored in the fields, if the two charges are separated by a distance d.[Answer: (μ0/4π)qeqm.]26 What does the conserved quantity Q in Prob. 5.48 represent, physically? Problem 8.22. A magnetic dipole m = mˆz is at rest at the origin; an electric charge qe is at rest at r. Find the angular momentum in their fields. [Hint: The fastest way to get it is to exploit the result of Prob. 8.21.] Problem 8.23. Consider a stationary ideal magnetic dipole m in a static electric field E.Show that the fields carry momentum p = −ϵ0μ0(m × E). (8.45) Here E is evaluated at the location of the dipole. We stipulate that the electric field is localized (it goes to zero at infinity), otherwise the momentum is ill defined (the integral does not converge). [Hint: There are several ways to do this. The simplest is to start with p = ϵ0 ∫ (E × B) dτ, write E = −∇V, and use integration by parts to show that p = ϵ0μ0 ∫ V J dτ. (8.46) 25 This system is known as Thomson’s dipole. See I. Adawi, Am.J.Phys. 44, 762 (1976) and Phys. Rev. D31, 3301 (1985), and K. R. Brownstein, Am. J. Phys. 57, 420 (1989), for discussion and references. 26 Note that this result is independent of the separation distance d! It points from qe toward qm. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum comes in half-integer multiples of ℏ,so this result suggests that if magnetic monopoles exist, electric and magnetic charge must be quantized: μ0qeqm/4π = nℏ/2, for n = 1, 2, 3, ... , an idea first proposed by Dirac in 1931. If even one monopole is lurking somewhere in the Universe, this would “explain” why electric charge comes in discrete units. (However, see D. Singleton, Am.J.Phys. 66, 697 (1998) for a cautionary note.) 387 More Problems on Chapter 8 So far, this is valid for any localized static configuration. For a current confined to an infinitesimal neighborhood of the origin we can approximate V (r) ≈ V (0) − E(0) · r.Treatthedipole as a current loop, and use Eqs. 5.82 and 1.108.]27 Problem 8.24. Because the cylinders in Ex. 8.4 are left rotating (at angular velocities ωa and ωb, say), there is actually a residual magnetic field, and hence angular momentum in the fields, even after the current in the solenoid has been extinguished. If the cylinders are heavy, this correction will be negligible, but it is interesting to do the problem without making that assumption.28 (a) Calculate (in terms of ωa and ωb) the final angular momentum in the fields. [Define ω = ωˆz,so ωa and ωb could be positive or negative.] (b) As the cylinders begin to rotate, their changing magnetic field induces an extra azimuthal electric field, which, in turn, will make an additional contribution to the torques.

Find the linear momentum and the angular momentum (with respect to the origin) in the fields. (Put q on the x-axis, with the solenoid along z; treat the solenoid as a nonconductor, so you don’t need to worry about induced charges on its surface.) [Answer: p = (μ0qnIR2/2a)ˆy; L = 0.] What if a < R? ! Problem 8.26. A point electric dipole p is located at the center of a spherical shell (radius R) carrying a surface current K = K0 sin θ ˆφ. (a) Write down the electric and magnetic fields, inside and outside the sphere. [Hints: Don’t forget the contact term in the electric field; for the magnetic field refer to Exs. 5.11 and 6.1, and express your answer in terms of the magnetic dipole moment m of the sphere.] (b) Calculate the momentum in the fields. (c) Suppose we turn off the electric field, by connecting a fine wire between the two ends of the dipole and allowing it to discharge quasistatically. Find the net impulse delivered to the current in the wire. [Hint: In parts (c) and (d) it may help to set the z-axis along p,instead of m, but always express your final answer in coordinate-independent form.] 27 As it stands, Eq. 8.45 is valid only for ideal dipoles. But g is linear in B, and therefore, if E is held fixed, obeys the superposition principle: for a collection of magnetic dipoles, the total momentum is the (vector) sum of the momenta for each one separately. In particular, if E is uniform over a localized steady current distribution, then Eq. 8.45 is valid for the whole thing, only now m is the total magnetic dipole moment. 28 This problem was suggested by Paul DeYoung. 29 See F. S. Johnson, B. L. Cragin, and R. R. Hodges, Am. J. Phys. 62, 33 (1994), and B. Y.-K. Hu, Eur. J. Phys. 33, 873 (2012) for discussion of this and related problems. 388 8 Conservation Laws (d) Meanwhile, the changing electric field induces a magnetic field, Bind; what is this field, and what impulse does it deliver to the sphere? (e) Suppose instead we turn off the magnetic field, by gradually decreasing K0. The changing magnetic field induces an electric field, Eind. What impulse does this deliver to p? (f) Comment on your results. Is momentum conserved, here?30 Problem 8.27. (a) Carry through the argument in Section 8.1.2, starting with Eq. 8.6, but using Jf in place of J. Show that the Poynting vector becomes S = E × H, (8.47) and the rate of change of the energy density in the fields is ∂u ∂t = E · ∂D ∂t + H · ∂B ∂t . For linear media, show that31 u = 1 2 (E · D + B · H). (8.48) (b) In the same spirit, reproduce the argument in Section 8.2.2, starting with Eq. 8.14, with ρf and Jf in place of ρ and J. Don’t bother to construct the Maxwell stress tensor, but do show that the momentum density is32 g = D × B. (8.49) Problem 8.28. A circular disk of radius R and mass M carries n point charges (q), attached at regular intervals around its rim. At time t = 0 the disk lies in the xy plane, with its center at the origin, and is rotating about the z-axis with angular velocity ω0, when it is released. The disk is immersed in a (time-independent) external magnetic field B(s, z) = k(−sˆs + 2zˆz), where k is a constant. (a) Find the position of the center of the ring, z(t), and its angular velocity, ω(t),asfunctions of time. (Ignore gravity.) (b) Describe the motion, and check that the total (kinetic) energy – translational plus rota- tional – is constant, confirming that the magnetic force does no work.33 30 This is not the end of the story, as we shall see in Chapter 12 (Prob. 12.43). 31 Refer to Section 4.4.3 for the meaning of “energy” in this context. 32 For over 100 years there has been a raging debate (still not completely resolved) as to whether the field momentum in polarizable/magnetizable media is Eq. 8.49 (Minkowski’s candidate) or ϵ0μ0 (E × H) (Abraham’s). See D. J. Griffiths, Am.J.Phys. 80, 7 (2012). 33 This cute problem is due to K. T. McDonald, http://kirkmcd.princeton.edu/examples/disk .pdf (who draws a somewhat different conclusion). 389 More Problems on Chapter 8 Problem 8.29. A particle with magnetic dipole moment m = mˆz and (positive) charge Q is fixed at the origin. A particle of (negative) charge q is released from rest at infinity, and “falls” in, attracted by Q and deflected by the magnetic field of m. Its resulting trajectory is r(t) = (r(t), θ(t), φ(t)). (a) Show that the z component of the torque on q is Nz = μ0qm 4π ( sin2 θ r2 ˙r − 2 sin θ cos θ r ˙θ) = − μ0qm 4π d dt ( sin2 θ r ), and hence the z component of its angular momentum is Lz = − μ0qm 4π sin2 θ r . (b) Where did this angular momentum come from? [Hint: Refer to Prob. 8.22.] 9 Electromagnetic Waves 9.1 Waves in One Dimension 9.1.1 The Wave Equation What is a “wave”? I don’t think I can give you an entirely satisfactory answer – the concept is intrinsically somewhat vague – but here’s a start: Awaveisa disturbance of a continuous medium that propagates with a fixed shape at constant velocity. Immediately I must add qualifiers: in the presence of absorption, the wave will diminish in size as it moves; if the medium is dispersive, different frequencies travel at different speeds; in two or three dimensions, as the wave spreads out, its amplitude will decrease; and of course standing waves don’t propagate at all. But these are refinements; let’s start with the simple case: fixed shape, constant speed, one dimension (Fig. 9.1). How would you represent such an object mathematically? In Fig. 9.1, I have drawn the wave at two different times, once at t = 0, and again at some later time t – each point on the wave form simply shifts to the right by an amount vt,where v is the velocity. Maybe the wave is generated by shaking one end of a taut string; f (z, t) represents the displacement of the string at the point z, at time t.Given the initial shape of the string, g(z) ≡ f (z,0), what is the subsequent form, f (z, t)? Well, the displacement at point z,at the later time t, is the same as the displacement a distance vt to the left (that is, at z − vt), back at time t = 0: f (z, t) = f (z − vt,0) = g(z − vt). (9.1) That statement captures (mathematically) the essence of wave motion. It tells us that the function f (z, t), which might have depended on z and t in any old way, in fact depends on them only in the very special combination z − vt; when that is true, the function f (z, t) represents a wave of fixed shape traveling in the z direction at speed v. For example, if A and b are constants (with the appropriate units), f1(z, t) = Ae−b(z−vt)2 , f2(z, t) = A sin[b(z − vt)], f3(z, t) = A b(z − vt)2 + 1 all represent waves (with different shapes, of course), but f4(z, t) = Ae−b(bz2+vt) and f5(z, t) = A sin(bz) cos(bvt)3 do not. 391 9.1 Waves in One Dimension vt f z f(z, 0) f(z, t) v Fig. 9.1 θ\u0007 z z T T f z + \bz θ Fig. 9.2 Why does a stretched string support wave motion? Actually, it follows from Newton’s second law. Imagine a very long string under tension T. If it is displaced from equilibrium, the net transverse force on the segment between z and z + Δz (Fig. 9.2)is ΔF = T sin θ′ − T sin θ, where θ′ is the angle the string makes with the z direction at point z + Δz, and θ is the corresponding angle at point z. Provided that the distortion of the string is not too great, these angles are small (the figure is exaggerated, obviously), and we can replace the sine by the tangent: ΔF ≈ T (tan θ′ − tan θ) = T ( ∂f ∂z |||z+Δz − ∂f ∂z |||z) ≈ T ∂2f ∂z2 Δz. If the mass per unit length is μ, Newton’s second law says ΔF = μ(Δz) ∂2f ∂t2 , and therefore ∂2f ∂z2 = μ T ∂2f ∂t2 . Evidently, small disturbances on the string satisfy ∂2f ∂z2 = 1 v2 ∂2f ∂t2 , (9.2) where v (which, as we’ll soon see, represents the speed of propagation) is v = √ T μ . (9.3) 392 9 Electromagnetic Waves Equation 9.2 is known as the (classical) wave equation, because it admits as solutions all functions of the form f (z, t) = g(z − vt) (9.4) (that is, all functions that depend on the variables z and t in the special combination u ≡ z − vt), and we have just learned that such functions represent waves propagating in the z direction with speed v. Proof. ∂f ∂z = dg du ∂u ∂z = dg du , ∂f ∂t = dg du ∂u ∂t = −v dg du , and ∂2f ∂z2 = ∂ ∂z ( dg du ) = d2g du2 ∂u ∂z = d2g du2 , ∂2f ∂t2 = −v ∂ ∂t ( dg du ) = −v d2g du2 ∂u ∂t = v2 d2g du2 , so d2g du2 = ∂2f ∂z2 = 1 v2 ∂2f ∂t2 . □ Note that g(u) can be any (differentiable) function whatever. 1 If the disturbance propagates at constant speed without changing its shape, then it satisfies the wave equation. But functions of the form g(z − vt) are not the only solutions. The wave equation involves the square of v, so we can generate another class of solutions by simply changing the sign of the velocity: f (z, t) = h(z + vt). (9.5) This, of course, represents a wave propagating in the negative z direction, and it is certainly reasonable (on physical grounds) that such solutions would be allowed. What is perhaps surprising is that the most general solution to the wave equation is the sum of a wave to the right and a wave to the left: f (z, t) = g(z − vt) + h(z + vt). (9.6) (Notice that the wave equation is linear: the sum of any two solutions is itself a solution.) As it turns out, every solution to the wave equation can be expressed in this form. Like the simple harmonic oscillator equation, the wave equation is ubiquitous in physics. If something is vibrating, the oscillator equation is almost certainly responsible (at least, for small amplitudes), and if something is waving (whether the context is mechanics or acoustics, optics 1 Does it surprise you that the class of solutions to the wave equation is so huge? After all, an ordinary second-order differential equation typically admits just two linearly independent solutions …. That’s right, but there’s no such rule for partial differential equations. 393 9.1 Waves in One Dimension or oceanography), the wave equation (perhaps with some decoration) is bound to be involved. Problem 9.1. By explicit differentiation, check that the functions f1, f2,and f3 in the text satisfy the wave equation. Show that f4 and f5 do not. Problem 9.2. Show that the standing wave f (z, t) = A sin(kz) cos(kvt) satisfies the wave equation, and express it as the sum of a wave traveling to the left and a wave traveling to the right (Eq. 9.6). 9.1.2 Sinusoidal Waves (i) Terminology. Of all possible wave forms, the sinusoidal one f (z, t) = A cos[k(z − vt) + δ] (9.7) is (for good reason) the most familiar. Figure 9.3 shows this function at time t = 0. The quantity A is the amplitude of the wave (it is positive, and represents the maximum displacement from equilibrium). The argument of the cosine is called the phase,and δ is the phase constant (obviously, you can add any integer multiple of 2π to δ without changing f (z, t); ordinarily, one uses a value in the range 0 ≤ δ < 2π, but sometimes −π < δ ≤ π,for example, may be more convenient). Notice that at z = vt − δ/k, the phase is zero; let’s call this the “central maximum.” If δ = 0, the central maximum passes the origin at time t = 0; more generally, δ/k is the distance by which the central maximum (and therefore the entire wave) is “delayed.” Finally, k is the wave number; it is related to the wavelength λ by the equation λ = 2π k , (9.8) for when z advances by 2π/k, the cosine executes one complete cycle. As time passes, the entire wave train proceeds to the right, at speed v. At any given point z, the string vibrates up and down, undergoing one full cycle in a period T = 2π kv . (9.9) f(z, 0) δ\fk A v z Central maximum λ Fig. 9.3 394 9 Electromagnetic Waves f(z, 0) δ\fk z v Central maximum Fig. 9.4 The frequency ν (number of oscillations per unit time) is ν = 1 T = kv 2π = v λ . (9.10) For our purposes, a more convenient unit is the angular frequency ω, so called because in the analogous case of uniform circular motion, it represents the number of radians swept out per unit time: ω = 2πν = kv,so ω = kv. (9.11) Ordinarily, it’s nicer to write sinusoidal waves (Eq. 9.7) in terms of ω, instead of v: 2 f (z, t) = A cos(kz − ωt + δ). (9.12) A sinusoidal oscillation of wave number k and (angular) frequency ω traveling to the left would be written f (z, t) = A cos(kz + ωt − δ). (9.13) The sign of the phase constant is chosen for consistency with our previous convention that δ/k shall represent the distance by which the wave is “delayed” (since the wave is now moving to the left, a delay means a shift to the right). At t = 0, the wave looks like Fig. 9.4. Because the cosine is an even function, we can just as well write Eq. 9.13 thus: f (z, t) = A cos(−kz − ωt + δ). (9.14) Comparison with Eq. 9.12 reveals that we could simply switch the sign of k to produce a wave with the same amplitude, phase constant, frequency, and wavelength, traveling in the opposite direction. (ii) Complex notation. In view of Euler’s formula, eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ, (9.15) the sinusoidal wave (Eq. 9.12) can be written f (z, t) = Re[Aei(kz−ωt+δ)], (9.16) 2 I put a box around the equation ω = kv, because the relation between wave number (or wavelength) and frequency (ν or ω) is fundamental, and it really ought to have a memorable name. Essentially the same idea can be expressed in several different ways: νλ = v, λω = 2πv,etc. 395 9.1 Waves in One Dimension where Re(ξ) denotes the real part of the complex number ξ. This invites us to introduce the complex wave function ˜f (z, t) ≡ ˜Aei(kz−ωt), (9.17) with the complex amplitude ˜A ≡ Aeiδ subsuming both the (positive) real amplitude A and the phase constant δ.The actual wave function is the real part of ˜f : f (z, t) = Re[˜f (z, t)]. (9.18) If you know ˜f , it is a simple matter to find f ;the advantage of the complex notation is that exponentials are much easier to manipulate than sines and cosines. Example 9.1. Suppose you want to add two sinusoidal waves: f3 = f1 + f2 = Re( ˜f 1) + Re( ˜f 2) = Re( ˜f 1 + ˜f 2) = Re( ˜f 3), with ˜f 3 = ˜f 1 + ˜f 2. You simply add the corresponding complex wave functions, and then take the real part. In particular, if they have the same frequency and wave number, ˜f 3 = ˜A1ei(kz−ωt) + ˜A2ei(kz−ωt) = ˜A3ei(kz−ωt), where ˜A3 = ˜A1 + ˜A2,or A3eiδ3 = A1eiδ1 + A2eiδ2 . (9.19) In other words, you just add the (complex) amplitudes. The combined wave still has the same frequency and wavelength, f3(z, t) = A3 cos(kZ − ωt + δ3), and you can easily figure out A3 and δ3 from Eq. 9.19 (see Prob. 9.3). Try doing this without using the complex notation – you will find yourself looking up trig identities and wading through nasty algebra. Caveat: The complex notation is great for adding sinusoidal functions, because Re( ˜f 1 + ˜f 2) = Re( ˜f 1) + Re( ˜f 2), but not so useful for multiplying them: Re( ˜f 1 · ˜f 2) \u0002 Re( ˜f 1) · Re( ˜f 2). Be on guard, therefore, when you encounter quantities (energy, for exam- ple) that are quadratic. There are tricks for handling special cases (see Prob. 9.12), but the fireproof method is to revert to the real notation. 396 9 Electromagnetic Waves (iii) Linear combinations of sinusoidal waves. Although the sinusoidal function (Eq. 9.17) is a very special wave form, the fact is that any wave can be expressed as a linear combination of sinusoidal ones: ˜f (z, t) = ∫ ∞ −∞ ˜A(k)ei(kz−ωt) dk. (9.20) Here ω is a function of k (Eq. 9.11), and I have allowed k to run negative in order to include waves going both directions.3 The formula for ˜A(k), in terms of the initial conditions f (z,0) and ˙f (z,0), can be obtained from the theory of Fourier transforms (see Prob. 9.34), but the details are not relevant to my purpose here. The point is that any wave can be written as a linear combination of sinusoidal waves, and therefore if you know how sinusoidal waves behave, you know in principle how any wave behaves. So from now on, we shall confine our attention to sinusoidal waves. Problem 9.3. Use Eq. 9.19 to determine A3 and δ3 in terms of A1, A2, δ1,and δ2. Problem 9.4. Obtain Eq. 9.20 directly from the wave equation, by separation of variables. 9.1.3 Boundary Conditions: Reflection and Transmission So far, I have assumed the string is infinitely long – or at any rate long enough that we don’t need to worry about what happens to a wave when it reaches the end. As a matter of fact, what happens depends a lot on how the string is attached – that is, on the specific boundary conditions to which the wave is subject. Suppose, for instance, that the string is simply tied onto a second string. The tension T is the same for both, but the mass per unit length μ, presumably, is not, and hence the wave velocities v1 and v2 are different (remember, v = √T/μ). Let’s say, for convenience, that the knot occurs at z = 0. The incident wave ˜f I (z, t) = ˜AI ei(k1z−ωt) (z < 0), (9.21) coming in from the left, gives rise to a reflected wave ˜f R(z, t) = ˜ARei(−k1z−ωt) (z < 0), (9.22) traveling back along string 1 (hence the minus sign in front of k1), in addition to a transmitted wave ˜f T (z, t) = ˜AT ei(k2z−ωt) (z > 0), (9.23) which continues on to the right in string 2. 3 This does not mean that λ and ω are negative – wavelength and frequency are intrinsically positive (like speed v and amplitude A). If we allow negative wave numbers, then Eqs. 9.8 and 9.11 should really be written λ = 2π/ |k | and ω = |k |v. 397 9.1 Waves in One Dimension The incident wave fI (z, t) is a sinusoidal oscillation that extends (in prin- ciple) all the way back to z = −∞, and has been doing so for all of history. Thesamegoesfor fR and fT (except that the latter, of course, extends to z =+ ∞). All parts of the system are oscillating at the same frequency ω (a frequency determined by the person at z = −∞, who is shaking the string in the first place). Since the wave velocities are different in the two strings, however, the wavelengths and wave numbers are also different: λ1 λ2 = k2 k1 = v1 v2 . (9.24) Of course, this situation is pretty artificial – what’s more, with incident and reflected waves of infinite extent traveling on the same piece of string, it’s going to be hard for a spectator to tell them apart. You might therefore prefer to consider an incident wave of finite extent – say, the pulse shown in Fig. 9.5. You can work out the details for yourself, if you like (Prob. 9.5). The trouble with this approach is that no finite pulse is truly sinusoidal. The waves in Fig. 9.5 may look like sine functions, but they’re not: they’re little pieces of sines, joined onto an entirely different function (namely, zero). Like any other waves, they can be built up as linear combinations of true sinusoidal functions (Eq. 9.20), but only by putting together a whole range of frequencies and wavelengths. If you want a single incident frequency (as we shall in the electromagnetic case), you must let your waves extend to infinity. (In practice, if you use a very long pulse, with many oscillations, it will be close to the ideal of a single frequency.) For a sinusoidal incident wave, then, the net disturbance of the string is ˜f (z, t) = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ˜AI ei(k1z−ωt) + ˜ARei(−k1z−ωt) for z < 0, ˜AT ei(k2z−ωt) for z > 0. (9.25) At the join (z = 0), the displacement just slightly to the left (z = 0 −) must equal the displacement slightly to the right (z = 0 +) – else there would be a break in the string. Mathematically, f (z, t) is continuous at z = 0: f (0 −, t) = f (0 +, t). (9.26) If the knot itself is of negligible mass, then the derivative of f must also be continuous: ∂f ∂z |||0− = ∂f ∂z |||0+ . (9.27) f 1 2 z v v (a) Incident pulse f 1 z (b) Reflected and transmitted pulses v Fig. 9.5 398 9 Electromagnetic Waves T T zz T T (a) Discontinuous slope; force on knot (b) Continuous slope; no force on knot Knot Knot Fig. 9.6 Otherwise there would be a net force on the knot, and therefore an infinite acceleration (Fig. 9.6). These boundary conditions apply directly to the real wave function f (z, t). But since the imaginary part of ˜f differs from the real part only in the replacement of cosine by sine (Eq. 9.15), it follows that the complex wave function ˜f (z, t) obeys the same rules: ˜f (0 −, t) = ˜f (0 +, t), ∂ ˜f ∂z |||0− = ∂ ˜f ∂z |||0+ . (9.28) When applied to Eq. 9.25, these boundary conditions determine the outgoing amplitudes ( ˜AR and ˜AT ) in terms of the incoming one ( ˜AI ): ˜AI + ˜AR = ˜AT , k1( ˜AI − ˜AR) = k2 ˜AT , from which it follows that ˜AR = ( k1 − k2 k1 + k2 ) ˜AI , ˜AT = ( 2k1 k1 + k2 ) ˜AI . (9.29) Or, in terms of the velocities (Eq. 9.24): ˜AR = ( v2 − v1 v2 + v1 ) ˜AI , ˜AT = ( 2v2 v2 + v1 ) ˜AI . (9.30) The real amplitudes and phases, then, are related by AReiδR = ( v2 − v1 v2 + v1 )AI eiδI , AT eiδT = ( 2v2 v2 + v1 )AI eiδI . (9.31) If the second string is lighter than the first (μ2 < μ1, so that v2 > v1), all three waves have the same phase angle (δR = δT = δI ), and the outgoing amplitudes are AR = ( v2 − v1 v2 + v1 )AI , AT = ( 2v2 v2 + v1 )AI . (9.32) If the second string is heavier than the first (v2 < v1), the reflected wave is out of phase by 180 ◦ (δR + π = δT = δI ). In other words, since cos(−k1z − ωt + δI − π) = − cos(−k1z − ωt + δI ), the reflected wave is “upside down.” The amplitudes in this case are AR = ( v1 − v2 v2 + v1 )AI , AT = ( 2v2 v2 + v1 )AI . (9.33) 399 9.1 Waves in One Dimension In particular, if the second string is infinitely massive – or, what amounts to the same thing, if the first string is simply tied to an immovable post at the end – then AR = AI and AT = 0. Naturally, in this case there is no transmitted wave – all of it reflects back. ! Problem 9.5. Suppose you send an incident wave of specified shape, gI (z − v1t),down string 1. It gives rise to a reflected wave, hR(z + v1t), and a transmitted wave, gT (z − v2t). By imposing the boundary conditions 9.26 and 9.27,find hR and gT . Problem 9.6. (a) Formulate an appropriate boundary condition, to replace Eq. 9.27, for the case of two strings under tension T joined by a knot of mass m. (b) Find the amplitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted waves for the case where the knot has mass m and the second string is massless. ! Problem 9.7. Suppose string 2 is embedded in a viscous medium (such as molasses), which imposes a drag force that is proportional to its (transverse) speed: ΔFdrag = −γ ∂f ∂t Δz. (a) Derive the modified wave equation describing the motion of the string. (b) Solve this equation, assuming the string vibrates at the incident frequency ω. That is, look for solutions of the form ˜f (z, t) = e−iωt ˜F (z). (c) Show that the waves are attenuated (that is, their amplitude decreases with increasing z). Find the characteristic penetration distance, at which the amplitude is 1/e of its original value, in terms of γ, T, μ,and ω. (d) If a wave of amplitude AI , phase δI = 0, and frequency ω is incident from the left (string 1), find the reflected wave’s amplitude and phase. 9.1.4 Polarization The waves that travel down a string when you shake it are called transverse, because the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. If the string is reasonably elastic, it is also possible to stimulate compression waves, by giving the string little tugs. Compression waves are hard to see on a string, but if you try it with a slinky they’re quite noticeable (Fig. 9.7). These waves are called longitudinal, because the displacement from equilibrium is along the direction of propagation. Sound waves, which are nothing but compression waves in air, are longitudinal; electromagnetic waves, as we shall see, are transverse. 400 9 Electromagnetic Waves v Fig. 9.7 z y x (a) Vertical polarization z y x (b) Horizontal polarization z v vv y x (c) Polarization vector nˆ θ Fig. 9.8 Now there are, of course, two dimensions perpendicular to any given line of propagation. Accordingly, transverse waves occur in two independent states of polarization: you can shake the string up-and-down (“vertical” polarization – Fig. 9.8a), ˜f v(z, t) = ˜Aei(kz−ωt) ˆx, (9.34) or left-and-right (“horizontal” polarization – Fig. 9.8b), ˜f h(z, t) = ˜Aei(kz−ωt)ˆy, (9.35) or along any other direction in the xy plane (Fig. 9.8c): ˜f (z, t) = ˜Aei(kz−ωt)ˆn. (9.36) The polarization vector ˆn defines the plane of vibration. 4 Because the waves are transverse, ˆn is perpendicular to the direction of propagation: ˆn · ˆz = 0. (9.37) In terms of the polarization angle θ, ˆn = cos θ ˆx + sin θ ˆy. (9.38) Thus, the wave pictured in Fig. 9.8c can be considered a superposition of two waves – one horizontally polarized, the other vertically: ˜f (z, t) = ( ˜A cos θ)e i(kz−ωt) ˆx + ( ˜A sin θ)ei(kz−ωt)ˆy. (9.39) 4 Notice that you can always switch the sign of ˆn, provided you simultaneously advance the phase constant by 180◦, since both operations change the sign of the wave function. 401 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum Problem 9.8. Equation 9.36 describes the most general linearly polarizedwaveonastring. Linear (or “plane”) polarization (so called because the displacement is parallel to a fixed vector ˆn) results from the combination of horizontally and vertically polarized waves of the same phase (Eq. 9.39). If the two components are of equal amplitude, but out of phase by 90◦ (say, δv = 0, δh = 90◦), the result is a circularly polarized wave. (a) At a fixed point z, show that the string moves in a circle about the z-axis. Does it go clockwise or counterclockwise, as you look down the axis toward the origin? How would you construct a wave circling the other way? (In optics, the clockwise case is called right circular polarization, and the counterclockwise, left circular polarization.)5 (b) Sketch the string at time t = 0. (c) How would you shake the string in order to produce a circularly polarized wave? 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum 9.2.1 The Wave Equation for E and B In regions of space where there is no charge or current, Maxwell’s equations read (i) ∇ · E = 0, (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × B = μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.40) They constitute a set of coupled, first-order, partial differential equations for E and B. They can be decoupled by applying the curl to (iii) and (iv): ∇ × (∇ × E) = ∇(∇ · E) − ∇2E = ∇ × (− ∂B ∂t ) = − ∂ ∂t (∇ × B) = −μ0ϵ0 ∂2E ∂t2 , ∇ × (∇ × B) = ∇(∇ · B) − ∇2B = ∇ × (μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t ) = μ0ϵ0 ∂ ∂t (∇ × E) = −μ0ϵ0 ∂2B ∂t2 , or, since ∇ · E = 0and ∇ · B = 0, ∇ 2E = μ0ϵ0 ∂2E ∂t2 , ∇ 2B = μ0ϵ0 ∂2B ∂t2 . (9.41) 5 An elegant notation for circular polarization (or elliptical, if the amplitudes are unequal) is to use a complex ˆn, but I shall not do so in this book. 402 9 Electromagnetic Waves We now have separate equations for E and B, but they are of second order; that’s the price you pay for decoupling them. In vacuum, then, each Cartesian component of E and B satisfies the three-dimensional wave equation, ∇2f = 1 v2 ∂2f ∂t2 . (This is the same as Eq. 9.2, except that ∂2f /∂z2 is replaced by its natural generalization, ∇ 2f .) So Maxwell’s equations imply that empty space sup- ports the propagation of electromagnetic waves, traveling at velocity v = 1 √ϵ0μ0 = 3.00 × 10 8 m/s, (9.42) which happens to be precisely the speed of light, c. Evidently, c = 1 √ϵ0μ0 . (9.43) The implication is astounding: perhaps light is an electromagnetic wave.6 Of course, this conclusion does not surprise anyone today, but imagine what a revelation it must have been in Maxwell’s time! Remember how ϵ0 and μ0 came into the theory in the first place: they were constants in Coulomb’s law and the Biot–Savart law, respectively. You measure them in experiments involving charged pith balls, batteries, and wires – experiments having nothing whatever to do with light. And yet, according to Maxwell’s theory, you can calculate c from these two numbers. Notice the crucial role played by Maxwell’s contribution to Ampère’s law (μ0ϵ0∂E/∂t): without it, the wave equation would not emerge, and there would be no electromagnetic theory of light. 9.2.2 Monochromatic Plane Waves For reasons discussed in Section 9.1.2, we may confine our attention to sinusoidal waves of frequency ω. Since different frequencies in the visible range correspond to different colors, such waves are called monochromatic (Table 9.1). Suppose, moreover, that the waves are traveling in the z direc- tion and have no x or y dependence; these are called plane waves, 7 because the fields are uniform over every plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation (Fig. 9.9). We are interested, then, in fields of the form 6 As Maxwell himself put it, “We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.” See I. Tolstoy, James Clerk Maxwell, A Biography, University of Chicago Press, Chicago (1983). 7 For a discussion of spherical waves, at this level, see J. R. Reitz, F. J. Milford, and R. W. Christy, Foundations of Electromagnetic Theory, 3rd ed., Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1979), Sect. 17-5. Or work Prob. 9.37. Of course, over small enough regions any wave is essentially plane, as long as the wavelength is much less than the radius of the curvature of the wave front. 403 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum Table 9.1.

Now, the wave equations for E and B (Eq. 9.41) were derived from Maxwell’s equations. However, whereas every solution to Maxwell’s equa- tions (in empty space) must obey the wave equation, the converse is not true; Maxwell’s equations impose extra constraints on ˜E0 and ˜B0. In particular, since ∇ · E = 0and ∇ · B = 0, it follows 8 that 8 Because the real part of ˜E differs from the imaginary part only in the replacement of sine by cosine, if the former obeys Maxwell’s equations, so does the latter, and hence ˜E as well. 404 9 Electromagnetic Waves x z v y EE E E Fig. 9.9 ( ˜E0)z = ( ˜B0)z = 0. (9.45) That is, electromagnetic waves are transverse: the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Moreover, Faraday’s law, ∇ × E = −∂B/∂t, implies a relation between the electric and magnetic amplitudes, to wit, − k( ˜E0)y = ω( ˜B0)x, k( ˜E0)x = ω( ˜B0)y, (9.46) or, more compactly, ˜B0 = k ω (ˆz × ˜E0). (9.47) Evidently, E and B are mutually perpendicular, and perpendicular to the direction of propagation (here, z), so they really have only one (nonzero) component each; they are in phase, and their (real) amplitudes are related by B0 = k ω E0 = 1 c E0. (9.48) The fourth of Maxwell’s equations, ∇ × B = μ0ϵ0(∂E/∂t), does not yield an independent condition; it simply reproduces Eq. 9.46. Example 9.2. If E points in the x direction, then B points in the y direction (Eq. 9.47): ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0ei(kz−ωt) ˆx, ˜B(z, t) = 1 c ˜E0ei(kz−ωt)ˆy, or (taking the real part) E(z, t) = E0 cos(kz − ωt + δ)ˆx, B(z, t) = 1 c E0 cos(kz − ωt + δ)ˆy. (9.49) This is the paradigm for a monochromatic plane wave (see Fig. 9.10). The wave as a whole is said to be polarized in the x direction (by convention, we use the direction of E to specify the polarization of an electromagnetic wave). 405 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum z y x E0 E0/c E B c Fig. 9.10 kc r k \r\u0003rˆ Fig. 9.11 There is nothing special about the z direction, of course – we can easily generalize to monochromatic plane waves traveling in an arbitrary direction. The notation is facilitated by the introduction of the propagation (or wave) vector, k, pointing in the direction of propagation, whose mag- nitude is the wave number k. The scalar product k · r is the appropriate generalization of kz (Fig. 9.11), so ˜E(r, t) = ˜E0ei(k·r−ωt)ˆn, ˜B(r, t) = 1 c ˜E0ei(k·r−ωt) (ˆk × ˆn) = 1 c ˆk × ˜E, (9.50) where ˆn is the polarization vector. Because E is transverse, ˆn · ˆk = 0. (9.51) (The transversality of B follows automatically from Eq. 9.50.) The actual (real) electric and magnetic fields in a monochromatic plane wave with propagation vector k and polarization ˆn are E(r, t) = E0 cos(k · r − ωt + δ)ˆn, (9.52) B(r, t) = 1 c E0 cos(k · r − ωt + δ)(ˆk × ˆn). (9.53) Problem 9.9. Write down the (real) electric and magnetic fields for a monochromatic plane wave of amplitude E0,frequency ω, and phase angle zero that is (a) traveling in the negative x direction and polarized in the z direction, and (b) traveling in the direction from the origin to the point (1, 1, 1), with polarization parallel to the xz plane. In each case, sketch the wave, and give the explicit Cartesian components of k and ˆn. 406 9 Electromagnetic Waves 9.2.3 Energy and Momentum in Electromagnetic Waves According to Eq. 8.5, the energy per unit volume in electromagnetic fields is u = 1 2 (ϵ0E2 + 1 μ0 B2). (9.54) In the case of a monochromatic plane wave (Eq. 9.49 or 9.53),9 B2 = 1 c2 E2 = μ0ϵ0E2, (9.55) so the electric and magnetic contributions are equal: u = ϵ0E2 = ϵ0E2 0 cos2(kz − ωt + δ). (9.56) As the wave travels, it carries this energy along with it. The energy flux density (energy per unit area, per unit time) transported by the fields is given by the Poynting vector (Eq. 8.10): S = 1 μ0 (E × B). (9.57) For monochromatic plane waves propagating in the z direction, S = cϵ0E2 0 cos2(kz − ωt + δ)ˆz = cuˆz. (9.58) Notice that S is the energy density (u) times the velocity of the waves (cˆz)–as it should be. For in a time Δt, a length cΔt passes through area A (Fig. 9.12), carrying with it an energy uAcΔt. The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported by the wave is therefore uc. Electromagnetic fields not only carry energy, they also carry momentum. In fact, we found in Eq. 8.29 that the momentum density stored in the fields is g = 1 c2 S. (9.59) A c c\bt Fig. 9.12 9 Notice that I’m using the real fields to calculate energy density. You might be tempted to introduce ˜u ≡ 1 2 (ϵ0 ˜E2 + 1 μ0 ˜B2), and take its real part, but Re(˜u) = ϵ0E2 0 cos[2(k · r − ωt + δ)] \u0002 u. Why doesn’t this work? 407 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum For monochromatic plane waves, then, g = 1 c ϵ0E2 0 cos2(kz − ωt + δ)ˆz = 1 c uˆz. (9.60) In the case of light, the wavelength is so short (∼ 5 × 10 −7 m), and the period so brief (∼ 10 −15 s), that any macroscopic measurement will encompass many cycles. Typically, therefore, we’re not interested in the rapidly fluctuating cosine-squared term in the energy and momentum densities; all we want is the average value. Now, the average of cosine- squared over a complete cycle10 is 1/2, so ⟨u⟩ = 1 2 ϵ0E2 0, (9.61) ⟨S⟩ = 1 2 cϵ0E2 0ˆz, (9.62) ⟨g⟩ = 1 2c ϵ0E2 0ˆz. (9.63) I use brackets, ⟨⟩, to denote the (time) average over a complete cycle (or many cycles, if you prefer). The average power per unit area transported by an electromagnetic wave is called the intensity: I ≡⟨S⟩ = 1 2 cϵ0E2 0. (9.64) When light falls (at normal incidence) on a perfect absorber, it delivers its momentum to the surface. In a time Δt, the momentum transfer is (Fig. 9.12) Δp = ⟨g⟩AcΔt,sothe radiation pressure (average force per unit area) is P = 1 A Δp Δt = 1 2 ϵ0E2 0 = I c . (9.65) (On a perfect reflector the pressure is twice as great, because the momentum switches direction, instead of simply being absorbed.) We can account for this pressure qualitatively, as follows: The electric field (Fig. 9.10)drives charges in the x direction, and the magnetic field then exerts on them a force q(v × B) in the z direction. The net force on all the charges in the surface produces the pressure. 11 Problem 9.10. The intensity of sunlight hitting the Earth is about 1300 W/m2. If sunlight strikes a perfect absorber, what pressure does it exert? How about a perfect reflector? What fraction of atmospheric pressure does this amount to? 10 There is a cute trick for doing this in your head: sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1, and over a complete cycle the average of sin2 θ is equal to the average of cos2 θ,so ⟨sin2⟩ = ⟨cos2⟩ = 1/2. Formally, 1 T ∫ T 0 cos2 (kz − 2πt/T + δ) dt = 1 2 . 11 Actually, it’s a little more subtle than this – see Prob. 9.11. 408 9 Electromagnetic Waves Problem 9.11. Consider a particle of charge q and mass m,freetomoveinthe xy plane in response to an electromagnetic wave propagating in the z direction (Eq. 9.49 –might as well set δ = 0). (a) Ignoring the magnetic force, find the velocity of the particle, as a function of time. (Assume the average velocity is zero.) (b) Now calculate the resulting magnetic force on the particle. (c) Show that the (time) average magnetic force is zero. The problem with this naïve model for the pressure of light is that the velocity is 90◦ out of phase with the fields. For energy to be absorbed, there’s got to be some resistance to the motion of the charges. Suppose we include a force of the form −γmv, for some damping constant γ. (d) Repeat part (a) (ignore the exponentially damped transient). Repeat part (b), and find the average magnetic force on the particle.12 Problem 9.12. In the complex notation there is a clever device for finding the time average of a product. Suppose f (r, t) = A cos(k · r − ωt + δa) and g(r, t) = B cos(k · r − ωt + δb). Show that ⟨fg⟩ = (1/2) Re( ˜f ˜g∗), where the star denotes complex conjugation. [Notethatthisonlyworks ifthetwo waveshavethe same k and ω, but they need not have the same amplitude or phase.] For example, ⟨u⟩ = 1 4 Re(ϵ0 ˜E · ˜E ∗ + 1 μ0 ˜B · ˜B ∗) and ⟨S⟩ = 1 2μ0 Re( ˜E × ˜B ∗). Problem 9.13. Find all elements of the Maxwell stress tensor for a monochromatic plane wave traveling in the z direction and linearly polarized in the x direction (Eq. 9.49). Does your answer make sense? (Remember that − ←→ T represents the momentum flux density.) How is the momentum flux density related to the energy density, in this case? 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter 9.3.1 Propagation in Linear Media Inside matter, but in regions where there is no free charge or free current, Maxwell’s equations become (i) ∇ · D = 0, (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × H = ∂D ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.66) If the medium is linear, D = ϵE, H = 1 μ B, (9.67) 12 C.

See also Prob. 9.36. 409 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter and homogeneous (so ϵ and μ do not vary from point to point), they reduce to (i) ∇ · E = 0, (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × B = μϵ ∂E ∂t , ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.68) which differ from the vacuum analogs (Eqs. 9.40) only in the replacement of μ0ϵ0 by μϵ.13 Evidently, electromagnetic waves propagate through a linear homogeneous medium at a speed v = 1 √ϵμ = c n , (9.69) where n ≡ √ ϵμ ϵ0μ0 (9.70) is the index of refraction of the substance. For most materials, μ is very close to μ0,so n ≈ √ϵr, (9.71) where ϵr is the dielectric constant14 (Eq. 4.34). Since ϵr is almost always greater than 1, light travels more slowly through matter – a fact that is well known from optics. All of our previous results carry over, with the simple transcription ϵ0 → ϵ, μ0 → μ, and hence c → v. The energy density is 15 u = 1 2 (ϵE2 + 1 μ B2), (9.72) and the Poynting vector is S = 1 μ (E × B). (9.73) For monochromatic plane waves, the frequency and wave number are related by ω = kv (Eq. 9.11), the amplitude of B is 1/v times the amplitude of E (Eq. 9.48), and the intensity 16 is 13 This observation is mathematically pretty trivial, but the physical implications are extraor- dinary: As the wave passes through, the fields busily polarize and magnetize all the molecules, and the resulting (oscillating) dipoles create their own electric and magnetic fields. These combine with the original fields in such a way as to create a single wave with the same frequency but a different speed. This remarkable conspiracy (known in optics as the Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem) is responsible for the phenomenon of transparency. It is a distinctly nontrivial consequence of linearity. For further discussion see M. B. James andD.J.Griffiths, Am.J.Phys. 60, 309 (1992); H. Fearn, D. F. V. James, and P. W. Milonni, Am.J.Phys. 64, 986 (1996); M. Mansuripur, Opt. Photonics News 9, 50 (1998). 14 The dielectric constant is “constant” in the sense of being independent of the amplitude of E, but it may well depend on the frequency, as we shall see. Thus, for example, if you quote the (static) dielectric constant for water, from Table 4.2, you will conclude that the index of refraction is 8.9, which is wildly off, for visible light (n = 1.33). 15 See Prob. 8.27; refer to Section 4.4.3 for the precise meaning of “energy density,” in the context of linear media. 16 The momentum carried by an electromagnetic wave in matter is controversial. See, for example, S. M. Barnett, Phys.Rev.Lett. 104, 070401 (2010). 410 9 Electromagnetic Waves I = 1 2 ϵvE2 0. (9.74) The interesting question is this: What happens when a wave passes from one transparent medium into another – air to water, say, or glass to plastic? As in the case of waves on a string, we expect to get a reflected wave and a transmitted wave. The details depend on the exact nature of the electrodynamic boundary conditions, which we derived in Chapter 7 (Eq. 7.74): (i) ϵ1E⊥ 1 = ϵ2E⊥ 2 , (iii) E ∥ 1 = E ∥ 2, (ii) B⊥ 1 = B⊥ 2 ,(iv) 1 μ1 B ∥ 1 = 1 μ2 B ∥ 2. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.75) These equations relate the electric and magnetic fields on either side of the interface between two linear media. In the following sections, we use them to deduce the laws governing reflection and refraction of electromagnetic waves. 9.3.2 Reflection and Transmission at Normal Incidence Suppose the xy plane forms the boundary between two linear media. A plane wave of frequency ω, traveling in the z direction and polarized in the x direction, approaches the interface from the left (Fig. 9.13): ˜EI (z, t) = ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BI (z, t) = 1 v1 ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt)ˆy. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.76) It gives rise to a reflected wave ˜ER(z, t) = ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BR(z, t) = − 1 v1 ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt)ˆy, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.77) z x y 1 2EI v1 v2 v1 BI BR BT ER ET Interface Fig. 9.13 411 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter which travels back to the left in medium 1, and a transmitted wave ˜ET (z, t) = ˜E0T ei(k2z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BT (z, t) = 1 v2 ˜E0T ei(k2z−ωt)ˆy, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.78) which continues on to the right in medium 2. Note the minus sign in ˜BR,as required by Eq. 9.50 – or, if you prefer, by the fact that the Poynting vector aims in the direction of propagation. At z = 0, the combined fields on the left, ˜EI + ˜ER and ˜BI + ˜BR, must join the fields on the right, ˜ET and ˜BT , in accordance with the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.75). In this case there are no components perpendicular to the surface, so (i) and (ii) are trivial. However, (iii) requires that ˜E0I + ˜E0R = ˜E0T , (9.79) while (iv) says 1 μ1 ( 1 v1 ˜E0I − 1 v1 ˜E0R ) = 1 μ2 ( 1 v2 ˜E0T ), (9.80) or ˜E0I − ˜E0R = β ˜E0T , (9.81) where β ≡ μ1v1 μ2v2 = μ1n2 μ2n1 . (9.82) Equations 9.79 and 9.81 are easily solved for the outgoing amplitudes, in terms of the incident amplitude: ˜E0R = ( 1 − β 1 + β ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = ( 2 1 + β ) ˜E0I . (9.83) These results are strikingly similar to the ones for waves on a string. Indeed, if the permeabilities μ are close to their values in vacuum (as, remember, they are for most media), then β = v1/v2, and we have ˜E0R = ( v2 − v1 v2 + v1 ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = ( 2v2 v2 + v1 ) ˜E0I , (9.84) which are identical to Eqs. 9.30. In that case, as before, the reflected wave is in phase (right side up) if v2 > v1 and out of phase (upside down) if v2 < v1; the real amplitudes are related by E0R = ||| v2 − v1 v2 + v1 |||E0I , E0T = ( 2v2 v2 + v1 )E0I , (9.85) or, in terms of the indices of refraction, E0R = ||| n1 − n2 n1 + n2 |||E0I , E0T = ( 2n1 n1 + n2 )E0I . (9.86) What fraction of the incident energy is reflected, and what fraction is transmitted? According to Eq. 9.74, the intensity (average power per unit area) is 412 9 Electromagnetic Waves I = 1 2 ϵvE2 0. If (again) μ1 = μ2 = μ0, then the ratio of the reflected intensity to the incident intensity is R ≡ IR II = ( E0R E0I ) 2 = ( n1 − n2 n1 + n2 ) 2, (9.87) whereas the ratio of the transmitted intensity to the incident intensity is T ≡ IT II = ϵ2v2 ϵ1v1 ( E0T E0I ) 2 = 4n1n2 (n1 + n2)2 . (9.88) Here, R is the reflection coefficient and T the transmission coefficient; they tell you the fraction of the incident energy that is reflected and transmitted, respectively. Notice that R + T = 1, (9.89) as conservation of energy, of course, requires. For instance, when light passes from air (n1 = 1) into glass (n2 = 1.5), R = 0.04 and T = 0.96. No surprise: most of the light is transmitted. Problem 9.14. Calculate the exact reflection and transmission coefficients, without assuming μ1 = μ2 = μ0.Confirmthat R + T = 1. Problem 9.15. In writing Eqs. 9.77 and 9.78, I tacitly assumed that the reflected and transmit- ted waves have the same polarization as the incident wave – along the x direction. Prove that this must be so. [Hint: Let the polarization vectors of the transmitted and reflected waves be ˆnT = cos θT ˆx + sin θT ˆy, ˆnR = cos θR ˆx + sin θR ˆy, and prove from the boundary conditions that θT = θR = 0.] 9.3.3 Reflection and Transmission at Oblique Incidence In the previous section, I treated reflection and transmission at normal incidence – that is, when the incoming wave hits the interface head-on. We now turn to the more general case of oblique incidence, in which the incoming wave meets the boundary at an arbitrary angle θI (Fig. 9.14). Of course, normal incidence is really just a special case of oblique incidence, with θI = 0, but I wanted to treat it separately, as a kind of warm-up, because the algebra is now going to get a little heavy. Suppose, then, that a monochromatic plane wave ˜EI (r, t) = ˜E0I ei(kI ·r−ωt), ˜BI (r, t) = 1 v1 (ˆkI × ˜EI ) (9.90) approaches from the left, giving rise to a reflected wave, ˜ER(r, t) = ˜E0R ei(kR ·r−ωt), ˜BR(r, t) = 1 v1 (ˆkR × ˜ER), (9.91) 413 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter z x kI kT kR I R T 1 2 Plane of incidence θ θ θ Fig. 9.14 and a transmitted wave ˜ET (r, t) = ˜E0T ei(kT ·r−ωt), ˜BT (r, t) = 1 v2 (ˆkT × ˜ET ). (9.92) All three waves have the same frequency ω – which is determined once and for all at the source (the flashlight, or whatever, that produces the incident beam). 17 The three wave numbers are related by Eq. 9.11: kI v1 = kRv1 = kT v2 = ω,or kI = kR = v2 v1 kT = n1 n2 kT . (9.93) The combined fields in medium 1, ˜EI + ˜ER and ˜BI + ˜BR, must now be joined to the fields ˜ET and ˜BT in medium 2, using the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.75). These all share the generic structure ()ei(kI ·r−ωt) + ()ei(kR ·r−ωt) = ()ei(kT ·r−ωt) at z = 0. (9.94) I’ll fill in the parentheses in a moment; for now, the important thing to notice is that the x, y,and t dependence is confined to the exponents. Because the boundary conditions must hold at all points on the plane, and for all times, these exponential factors must be equal (when z = 0). Otherwise, a slight change in x, say, would destroy the equality (see Prob. 9.16). Of course, the time factors are already equal (in fact, you could regard this as a confirmation that the transmitted and reflected frequencies must match the incident one). As for the spatial terms, evidently kI · r = kR · r = kT · r when z = 0, (9.95) or, more explicitly, x(kI )x + y(kI )y = x(kR)x + y(kR)y = x(kT )x + y(kT )y (9.96) for all x and all y. 17 Nonlinear (“active”) media can change the frequency, but we are talking only about linear media. 414 9 Electromagnetic Waves But Eq. 9.96 can only hold if the components are separately equal, for if x = 0, we get (kI )y = (kR)y = (kT )y, (9.97) while y = 0gives (kI )x = (kR)x = (kT )x. (9.98) We may as well orient our axes so that kI lies in the xz plane (that is, (kI )y = 0); according to Eq. 9.97, so too will kR and kT . Conclusion: First Law. The incident, reflected, and transmitted wave vectors form a plane (called the plane of incidence), which also includes the normal to the surface (here, the z-axis). Meanwhile, Eq. 9.98 implies that kI sin θI = kR sin θR = kT sin θT , (9.99) where θI is the angle of incidence, θR is the angle of reflection,and θT is the angle of transmission (more commonly known as the angle of refraction), all of them measured with respect to the normal (Fig. 9.14). In view of Eq. 9.93, then, Second Law. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, θI = θR. (9.100) This is the law of reflection. As for the transmitted angle, Third Law. sin θT sin θI = n1 n2 . (9.101) This is the law of refraction – Snell’s law. These are the three fundamental laws of geometrical optics. It is remark- able how little actual electrodynamics went into them: we have yet to invoke any specific boundary conditions – all we used was their generic form (Eq. 9.94). Therefore, any other waves (water waves, for instance, or sound waves) can be expected to obey the same “optical” laws when they pass from one medium into another. Now that we have taken care of the exponential factors – they cancel, given Eq. 9.95 – the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.75) become (i) ϵ1( ˜E0I + ˜E0R )z = ϵ2( ˜E0T )z, (ii) ( ˜B0I + ˜B0R )z = ( ˜B0T )z, (iii) ( ˜E0I + ˜E0R )x,y = ( ˜E0T )x,y, (iv) 1 μ1 ( ˜B0I + ˜B0R )x,y = 1 μ2 ( ˜B0T )x,y, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.102) where ˜B0 = (1/v)ˆk × ˜E0 in each case. (The last two represent pairs of equations, one for the x-component and one for the y-component.) 415 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter z x kT kI kR ER BR EI ET BT BI I R T 1 2 θθ θ Fig. 9.15 Suppose the polarization of the incident wave is parallel to the plane of incidence (the xz plane); it follows (see Prob. 9.15) that the reflected and transmitted waves are also polarized in this plane (Fig. 9.15). (I shall leave it for you to analyze the case of polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence; see Prob. 9.17.) Then (i) reads ϵ1(− ˜E0I sin θI + ˜E0R sin θR) = ϵ2(− ˜E0T sin θT ). (9.103) Item (ii) adds nothing (0 = 0), since the magnetic fields have no z compo- nents, (iii) becomes ˜E0I cos θI + ˜E0R cos θR = ˜E0T cos θT , (9.104) and (iv) says 1 μ1v1 ( ˜E0I − ˜E0R ) = 1 μ2v2 ˜E0T . (9.105) Given the laws of reflection and refraction, Eqs. 9.103 and 9.105 both reduce to ˜E0I − ˜E0R = β ˜E0T , (9.106) where (as before) β ≡ μ1v1 μ2v2 = μ1n2 μ2n1 , (9.107) and Eq. 9.104 says ˜E0I + ˜E0R = α ˜E0T , (9.108) where α ≡ cos θT cos θI . (9.109) Solving Eqs. 9.106 and 9.108 for the reflected and transmitted ampli- tudes, we obtain ˜E0R = ( α − β α + β ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = ( 2 α + β ) ˜E0I . (9.110) 416 9 Electromagnetic Waves These are known as Fresnel’s equations, for the case of polarization in the plane of incidence. (There are two other Fresnel equations, giving the reflected and transmitted amplitudes when the polarization is perpendicular to the plane of incidence – see Prob. 9.17.) Notice that the transmitted wave is always in phase with the incident one; the reflected wave is either in phase (“right side up”), if α > β, or 180 ◦ out of phase (“upside down”), if α < β. 18 The amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected waves depend on the angle of incidence, because α is a function of θI : α = √ 1 − sin2 θT cos θI = √1 − [(n1/n2) sin θI ]2 cos θI . (9.111) In the case of normal incidence (θI = 0), α = 1, and we recover Eq. 9.83. At grazing incidence (θI = 90 ◦), α diverges, and the wave is totally reflected (a fact that is painfully familiar to anyone who has driven at night on a wet road). Interestingly, there is an intermediate angle, θB (called Brewster’s angle), at which the reflected wave is completely extinguished. 19 According to Eq. 9.110, this occurs when α = β,or sin2 θB = 1 − β2 (n1/n2)2 − β2 . (9.112) For the typical case μ1 ≈ μ2,so β ≈ n2/n1, sin2 θB ≈ β2/(1 + β2), and hence tan θB ≈ n2 n1 . (9.113) Figure 9.16 shows a plot of the transmitted and reflected amplitudes as functions of θI , for light incident on glass (n2 = 1.5) from air (n1 = 1). (On the graph, a negative number indicates that the wave is 180 ◦ out of phase with the incident beam – the amplitude itself is the absolute value.) The power per unit area striking the interface is S · ˆz. Thus the incident intensity is II = 1 2 ϵ1v1E2 0I cos θI , (9.114) while the reflected and transmitted intensities are IR = 1 2 ϵ1v1E2 0R cos θR and IT = 1 2 ϵ2v2E2 0T cos θT . (9.115) (The cosines are there because I am talking about the average power per unit area of interface, and the interface is at an angle to the wave front.) 18 There is an unavoidable ambiguity in the phase of the reflected wave, since (as I mentioned in footnote 4) changing the sign of the polarization vector is equivalent to a 180◦ phase shift. The convention I adopted in Fig. 9.15, with ER positive “upward,” is consistent with some, but not all, of the standard optics texts. 19 Because waves polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence exhibit no corresponding quenching of the reflected component, an arbitrary beam incident at Brewster’s angle yields a reflected beam that is totally polarized parallel to the interface. That’s why Polaroid glasses, with the transmission axis vertical, help to reduce glare off a horizontal surface. 417 9.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Matter E0T E0I E0R E0I\u00020.4 \u00020.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 θB θI \u000e\u000f\u0010 \u0011\u000f\u0010 \u0012\u000f\u0010 \u0013\u000f\u0010 Fig. 9.16 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 θB θI 10° 30° 50° 70° 90°0° 20° 40° 60° 80° R T Fig. 9.17 The reflection and transmission coefficients for waves polarized parallel to the plane of incidence are R ≡ IR II = ( E0R E0I ) 2 = ( α − β α + β ) 2, (9.116) T ≡ IT II = ϵ2v2 ϵ1v1 ( E0T E0I ) 2 cos θT cos θI = αβ ( 2 α + β ) 2. (9.117) They are plotted as functions of the angle of incidence in Fig. 9.17 (for the air/glass interface). Physically, R is the fraction of the incident energy that is reflected – naturally, it goes to 0 at Brewster’s angle; T is the fraction transmitted – it goes to 1 at θB. Note that R + T = 1, as required by conservation of energy: the energy per unit time reaching a particular patch of area on the surface is equal to the energy per unit time leaving the patch (see Prob. 9.43): II = IT + IR.

Show that there is no Brewster’s angle for any n1 and n2: ˜E0R is never zero (unless, of course, n1 = n2 and μ1 = μ2, in which case the two media are optically indistinguishable). Confirm that your Fresnel equations reduce to the proper forms at normal incidence. Compute the reflection and transmission coefficients, and check that they add up to 1. Problem 9.18.

In the configuration of Fig. 9.15,isitthe case that SI = ST + SR? 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 9.4.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Conductors In Section 9.3 I stipulated that the free charge density ρf and the free current density Jf are zero, and everything that followed was predicated on that assumption. Such a restriction is perfectly reasonable when you’re talking about wave propagation through a vacuum or through insulating materials such as glass or (pure) water. But in the case of conductors we do not independently control the flow of charge, and in general Jf is certainly not zero. In fact, according to Ohm’s law, the (free) current density in a conductor is proportional to the electric field: Jf = σE. (9.119) With this, Maxwell’s equations for linear media assume the form (i) ∇ · E = 1 ϵ ρf , (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × B = μσE + μϵ ∂E ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.120) Now, the continuity equation for free charge, ∇ · Jf = − ∂ρf ∂t , (9.121) 419 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion together with Ohm’s law and Gauss’s law (i), gives ∂ρf ∂t = −σ(∇ · E) = − σ ϵ ρf for a homogeneous linear medium, from which it follows that ρf (t) = e−(σ/ϵ)tρf (0). (9.122) Thus any initial free charge ρf (0) dissipates in a characteristic time τ ≡ ϵ/σ. This reflects the familiar fact that if you put some free charge on a conductor, it will flow out to the edges. The time constant τ affords a measure of how “good” a conductor is: for a “perfect” conductor, σ = ∞ and τ = 0; for a “good” conductor, τ is much less than the other relevant times in the problem (in oscillatory systems, that means τ ≪ 1/ω); for a “poor” conductor, τ is greater than the characteristic times in the problem (τ ≫ 1/ω). 20 But we’re not interested in this transient behavior – we’ll wait for any accumulated free charge to disappear. From then on, ρf = 0, and we have (i) ∇ · E = 0, (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × B = μϵ ∂E ∂t + μσE. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.123) These differ from the corresponding equations for nonconducting media (Eq. 9.68) only in the last term in (iv) – which is absent, obviously, when σ = 0. Applying the curl to (iii) and (iv), as before, we obtain modified wave equations for E and B: ∇2E = μϵ ∂2E ∂t2 + μσ ∂E ∂t , ∇ 2B = μϵ ∂2B ∂t2 + μσ ∂B ∂t . (9.124) These equations still admit plane-wave solutions, ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0ei(˜kz−ωt), ˜B(z, t) = ˜B0ei(˜kz−ωt), (9.125) but this time the “wave number” ˜k is complex: ˜k2 = μϵω2 + iμσω, (9.126) as you can easily check by plugging Eq. 9.125 into Eq. 9.124. Taking the square root, ˜k = k + iκ, (9.127) 20 N. Ashby, Am. J. Phys. 43, 553 (1975), points out that for good conductors τ is absurdly short (10−19 s for copper, whereas the time between collisions is τc = 10−14 s). The problem is that Ohm’s law itself breaks down on timescales shorter than τc; actually, the time it takes free charge to dissipate in a good conductor is of order τc, not τ. Moreover, H. C. Ohanian, Am. J. Phys. 51, 1020 (1983), shows that it takes even longer for the fields and currents to equilibrate. But none of this is relevant to our present purpose; the net free charge density in a conductor does quickly dissipate, and exactly how long the process takes is beside the point. 420 9 Electromagnetic Waves where k ≡ ω √ ϵμ 2 [√ 1 + ( σ ϵω ) 2 + 1] 1/2, κ ≡ ω √ ϵμ 2 [√ 1 + ( σ ϵω ) 2 − 1] 1/2. (9.128) The imaginary part of ˜k results in an attenuation of the wave (decreasing amplitude with increasing z): ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt), ˜B(z, t) = ˜B0e−κzei(kz−ωt). (9.129) The distance it takes to reduce the amplitude by a factor of 1/e (about a third) is called the skin depth: d ≡ 1 κ ; (9.130) it is a measure of how far the wave penetrates into the conductor. Mean- while, the real part of ˜k determines the wavelength, the propagation speed, and the index of refraction, in the usual way: λ = 2π k , v = ω k , n = ck ω . (9.131) The attenuated plane waves (Eq. 9.129) satisfy the modified wave equa- tion (9.124)for any ˜E0 and ˜B0. But Maxwell’s equations (9.123) impose fur- ther constraints, which serve to determine the relative amplitudes, phases, and polarizations of E and B. As before, (i) and (ii) rule out any z compo- nents: the fields are still transverse. We may as well orient our axes so that E is polarized along the x direction: ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt) ˆx. (9.132) Then (iii) gives ˜B(z, t) = ˜k ω ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt)ˆy. (9.133) (Equation (iv) says the same thing.) Once again, the electric and magnetic fields are mutually perpendicular. Like any complex number, ˜k can be expressed in terms of its modulus and phase: ˜k = Keiφ, (9.134) where K ≡| ˜k| = √ k2 + κ2 = ω √ ϵμ √ 1 + ( σ ϵω ) 2 (9.135) and φ ≡ tan−1(κ/k). (9.136) According to Eqs. 9.132 and 9.133, the complex amplitudes ˜E0 = E0eiδE and ˜B0 = B0eiδB are related by B0eiδB = Ke iφ ω E0eiδE . (9.137) 421 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion x y z E e–kz B Fig. 9.18 Evidently the electric and magnetic fields are no longer in phase; in fact, δB − δE = φ; (9.138) the magnetic field lags behind the electric field. Meanwhile, the (real) amplitudes of E and B are related by B0 E0 = K ω = √ ϵμ √ 1 + ( σ ϵω ) 2. (9.139) The (real) electric and magnetic fields are, finally, E(z, t) = E0e−κz cos(kz − ωt + δE )ˆx, B(z, t) = B0e−κz cos(kz − ωt + δE + φ)ˆy. ⎫⎪⎬ ⎪ ⎭ (9.140) These fields are shown in Fig. 9.18.

Instead, we have the more general relations (Eq. 7.73) (i) ϵ1E⊥ 1 − ϵ2E⊥ 2 = σf , (iii) E ∥ 1 − E ∥ 2 = 0, (ii) B⊥ 1 − B⊥ 2 = 0, (iv) 1 μ1 B ∥ 1 − 1 μ2 B ∥ 2 = Kf × ˆn, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.141) where σf (not to be confused with conductivity) is the free surface charge, Kf is the free surface current, and ˆn (not to be confused with the polarization of the wave) is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from medium 2 into medium 1. For ohmic conductors (Jf = σE) there can be no free surface current, since this would require an infinite electric field at the boundary. 21 Suppose now that the xy plane forms the boundary between a noncon- ducting linear medium 1 and a conductor 2. A monochromatic plane wave, traveling in the z direction and polarized in the x direction, approaches from the left, as in Fig. 9.13: ˜EI (z, t) = ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BI (z, t) = 1 v1 ˜E0I ei(k1z−ωt)ˆy. (9.142) This incident wave gives rise to a reflected wave, ˜ER(z, t) = ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BR(z, t) = − 1 v1 ˜E0R ei(−k1z−ωt)ˆy, (9.143) propagating back to the left in medium 1, and a transmitted wave ˜ET (z, t) = ˜E0T ei(˜k2z−ωt) ˆx, ˜BT (z, t) = ˜k2 ω ˜E0T ei(˜k2z−ωt)ˆy, (9.144) which is attenuated as it penetrates into the conductor. 21 The vector J is a delta function at a surface current. I’ll consider the limiting case of a perfect conductor (σ = ∞) in a moment. 423 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion At z = 0, the combined wave in medium 1 must join the wave in medium 2, pursuant to the boundary conditions (Eq. 9.141). Since E⊥ = 0 on both sides, boundary condition (i) yields σf = 0. Since B⊥ = 0, (ii) is automatically satisfied. Meanwhile, (iii) gives ˜E0I + ˜E0R = ˜E0T , (9.145) and (iv) (with Kf = 0)says 1 μ1v1 ( ˜E0I − ˜E0R ) − ˜k2 μ2ω ˜E0T = 0, (9.146) or ˜E0I − ˜E0R = ˜β ˜E0T , (9.147) where ˜β ≡ μ1v1 μ2ω ˜k2. (9.148) It follows that ˜E0R = ( 1 − ˜β 1 + ˜β ) ˜E0I , ˜E0T = ( 2 1 + ˜β ) ˜E0I . (9.149) These results are formally identical to the ones that apply at the boundary between nonconductors (Eq. 9.83), but the resemblance is deceptive since ˜β is now a complex number. For a perfect conductor (σ = ∞), k2 = ∞ (Eq. 9.128), so ˜β is infinite, and 22 ˜E0R = − ˜E0I , ˜E0T = 0. (9.150) In this case the wave is totally reflected, with a 180 ◦ phase shift. (That’s why excellent conductors make good mirrors. In practice, you paint a thin coating of silver onto the back of a pane of glass – the glass has nothing to do with the reflection; it’s just there to support the silver and to keep it from tarnishing. Since the skin depth in silver at optical frequencies is less than 100 Å, you don’t need a very thick layer.) Problem 9.23. Calculate the reflection coefficient for light at an air-to-silver interface (μ1 = μ2 = μ0, ϵ1 = ϵ0, σ = 6 × 107(Ω · m)−1), at optical frequencies (ω = 4 × 1015/s). 9.4.3 The Frequency Dependence of Permittivity In the preceding sections, we have seen that the propagation of electromag- netic waves through matter is governed by three properties of the material: the permittivity ϵ, the permeability μ, and the conductivity σ. Actually, 22 For very large σ, k ≈ κ ≈ ω√σ/2 (Eq. 9.128), E0T goes like 1/√σ, and the free current density Jf = σE increases as the square root of σ. But this current is confined to a “skin” of diminishing depth d = 1/κ ∼ 1/ √σ, and goes to a surface current in the limit σ →∞. 424 9 Electromagnetic WavesIndex of refraction Wavelength, λ (in air) 1.450 4000 5000 6000 7000 Angstroms 1.460 1.470 1.480 Fig. 9.19 each of these parameters depends to some extent on the frequency of the waves you are considering. Indeed, it is well known from optics that n ≈ √ϵr is a function of wavelength (Fig. 9.19 shows the graph for a typical glass). A prism or a raindrop bends blue light more sharply than red, and spreads white light out into a rainbow of colors. This phenomenon is called dispersion. By extension, whenever the speed of a wave depends on its frequency, the supporting medium is said to be dispersive. Because waves of different frequency travel at different speeds in a dispersive medium, a wave form that incorporates a range of frequencies will change shape as it propagates. A sharply peaked wave typically flattens out, and whereas each sinusoidal component travels at the ordinary wave (or phase) velocity, v = ω k , (9.151) the packet as a whole (the “envelope”) moves at the so-called group velocity 23 vg = dω dk . (9.152) [You can demonstrate this by dropping a rock into the nearest pond and watching the waves that form: While the disturbance as a whole spreads out in a circle, moving at speed vg, the ripples that go to make it up will be seen to travel twice as fast (v = 2vg in this case). They appear at the back end of the packet, growing as they move forward to the center, then shrinking again and fading away at the front (Fig. 9.20).] We shall not concern ourselves with these matters – I’ll stick to monochromatic waves, for which the problem does not arise. But I should just mention that the energy carried by a wave packet in a dispersive medium does not travel at the phase velocity. Don’t be too alarmed, therefore, if in some circumstances v comes out greater than c. 24 23 See A. P. French, Vibrations and Waves, W. W. Norton, New York (1971), p. 230, or F. S. Crawford, Jr., Waves, McGraw-Hill, New York (1968), Sect. 6.2. 24 Even the group velocity can exceed c in special cases – see P. C. Peters, Am. J. Phys. 56, 129 (1988), or work Prob. 9.27. For delightful commentary, see C. F. Bohren, Am.J.Phys. 77, 101 (2009). And if two different “speeds of light” are not enough to satisfy you, check out 425 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion vg v Fig. 9.20 My purpose in this section is to account for the frequency dependence of ϵ in dielectrics, using a simplified model for the behavior of the electrons. Like all classical models of atomic-scale phenomena, it is at best an approx- imation to the truth; nevertheless, it does yield qualitatively satisfactory results, and it provides a plausible mechanism for dispersion in transparent media. The electrons in a nonconductor are bound to specific molecules. The actual binding forces can be quite complicated, but we shall picture each electron as attached to the end of a spring, with force constant kspring (Fig. 9.21): Fbinding = −kspringx = −mω2 0x, (9.153) where x is the displacement from equilibrium, m is the electron’s mass, and ω0 is the natural oscillation frequency, √ kspring/m. If this strikes you as an implausible model, look back at Ex. 4.1, where we were led to a force of precisely this form. As a matter of fact, practically any binding force can be approximated this way for sufficiently small displacements from equilibrium, as you can see by expanding the potential energy in a Taylor series about the equilibrium point: U (x) = U (0) + xU ′(0) + 1 2 x 2U ′′(0) + ··· . The first term is a constant, with no dynamical significance (you can always adjust the zero of potential energy so that U (0) = 0). The second term automatically vanishes, since dU/dx = −F, and by the nature of an equilibrium, the force at that point is zero. The third term is precisely the potential energy of a spring with force constant kspring = d2U/dx 2|0 (the second derivative is positive, for a point of stable equilibrium). As long as the displacements are small, the higher-order terms in the series can be neglected. Geometrically, all I am saying is that practically any function can be fit near a minimum by a suitable parabola. Meanwhile, there will presumably be some damping force on the electron: Fdamping = −mγ dx dt . (9.154) S. C. Bloch, Am. J. Phys. 45, 538 (1977), in which no fewer than eight distinct velocities are identified! Indeed, it’s not clear what you mean by the “velocity” of something that changes shape as it moves, and has no precise beginning or end. Do you mean the speed at which the peak intensity propagates? Or the speed at which energy is transported? Or information transmitted? In special relativity no causal signal can travel faster than c, but some of the other “velocities” have no such restriction. 426 9 Electromagnetic Waves z v x E Electron kspring Fig. 9.21 Again I have chosen the simplest possible form; the damping must be opposite in direction to the velocity, and making it proportional to the velocity is the easiest way to accomplish this. The cause of the damping does not concern us here – among other things, an oscillating charge radiates, and the radiation siphons off energy. We will calculate this “radiation damping” in Chapter 11. In the presence of an electromagnetic wave of frequency ω, polarized in the x direction (Fig. 9.21), the electron is subject to a driving force Fdriving = qE = qE0 cos(ωt), (9.155) where q is the charge of the electron and E0 is the amplitude of the wave at the point z where the electron is situated. (Since we’re only interested in one point, I have reset the clock so that the maximum E occurs there at t = 0. For simplicity, I assume the magnetic force is negligible.) Putting all this into Newton’s second law gives m d2x dt2 = Ftot = Fbinding + Fdamping + Fdriving, or m d2x dt2 + mγ dx dt + mω2 0x = qE0 cos(ωt). (9.156) Our model, then, describes the electron as a damped harmonic oscillator, driven at frequency ω. (The much more massive nucleus remains at rest.) Equation 9.156 is easier to handle if we regard it as the real part of a complex equation: d2 ˜x dt2 + γ d ˜x dt + ω2 0 ˜x = q m E0e−iωt. (9.157) In the steady state, the system oscillates at the driving frequency: ˜x(t) = ˜x0e−iωt. (9.158) Inserting this into Eq. 9.157, we obtain ˜x0 = q/m ω2 0 − ω2 − iγω E0. (9.159) The resulting dipole moment is the real part of ˜p(t) = q ˜x(t) = q 2/m ω2 0 − ω2 − iγω E0e−iωt. (9.160) 427 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion The imaginary term in the denominator means that p is out of phase with E – lagging behind by an angle tan−1[γω/(ω2 0 − ω2)] that is very small when ω ≪ ω0 and rises to π when ω ≫ ω0. In general, differently situated electrons within a given molecule experi- ence different natural frequencies and damping coefficients. Let’s say there are fj electrons with frequency ωj and damping γj in each molecule. If there are N molecules per unit volume, the polarization P is given by 25 the real part of ˜P = Nq 2 m (∑ j fj ω2 j − ω2 − iγj ω ) ˜E. (9.161) Now, I defined the electric susceptibility as the proportionality constant between P and E (specifically, P = ϵ0χeE). In the present case, P is not proportional to E (this is not, strictly speaking, a linear medium) because of the difference in phase. However, the complex polarization ˜P is proportional to the complex field ˜E, and this suggests that we introduce a complex susceptibility, ˜χe: ˜P = ϵ0 ˜χe ˜E. (9.162) All of the manipulations we went through before carry over, on the under- standing that the physical polarization is the real part of ˜P, just as the physical field is the real part of ˜E. In particular, the proportionality between ˜D and ˜E is the complex permittivity ˜ϵ = ϵ0(1+ ˜χe), and the complex dielectric constant (in this model) is ˜ϵr = ˜ϵ ϵ0 = 1 + Nq 2 mϵ0 ∑ j fj ω2 j − ω2 − iγj ω . (9.163) Ordinarily, the imaginary term is negligible; however, when ω is very close to one of the resonant frequencies (ωj) it plays an important role, as we shall see. In a dispersive medium, the wave equation for a given frequency reads ∇ 2 ˜E = ˜ϵμ0 ∂2 ˜E ∂t2 ; (9.164) it admits plane wave solutions, as before, ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0ei(˜kz−ωt), (9.165) with the complex wave number ˜k ≡ √˜ϵμ0ω. (9.166) Writing ˜k in terms of its real and imaginary parts, ˜k = k + iκ, (9.167) 25 This applies directly to the case of a dilute gas; for denser materials the theory is modified slightly, in accordance with the Clausius–Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.42). By the way, don’t confuse the “polarization” of a medium, P, with the “polarization” of a wave –same word, but completely unrelated meanings. 428 9 Electromagnetic Waves Eq. 9.165 becomes ˜E(z, t) = ˜E0e−κzei(kz−ωt). (9.168) The wave is attenuated (this is hardly surprising, since the damping absorbs energy). Because the intensity is proportional to E2 (and hence to e−2κz), the quantity α ≡ 2κ (9.169) is called the absorption coefficient. Meanwhile, the wave velocity is ω/k,and the index of refraction is n = ck ω . (9.170) I have deliberately used notation reminiscent of Section 9.4.1.However, in the present case k and κ have nothing to do with conductivity; rather, they are determined by the parameters of our damped harmonic oscillator. For gases, the second term in Eq. 9.163 is small, and we can approximate the square root (Eq. 9.166) by the first term in the binomial expansion,√ 1 + ε ≈ 1 + 1 2 ε. Then ˜k = ω c √˜ϵr ≈ ω c [1 + Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j fj ω2 j − ω2 − iγj ω ], (9.171) so n = ck ω ≈ 1 + Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j fj (ω2 j − ω2) (ω2 j − ω2)2 + γ2 j ω2 (9.172) and α = 2κ ≈ Nq 2ω2 mϵ0c ∑ j fj γj (ω2 j − ω2)2 + γ2 j ω2 . (9.173) In Fig. 9.22 I have plotted the index of refraction and the absorption coefficient in the vicinity of one of the resonances. Most of the time the index of refraction rises gradually with increasing frequency, consistent with our experience from optics (Fig. 9.19). However, in the immediate neighborhood of a resonance, the index of refraction drops sharply. Because this behavior is atypical, it is called anomalous dispersion. Notice that the region of anomalous dispersion (ω1 < ω < ω2 in the figure) coincides with the region of maximum absorption; in fact, the material may be practically opaque in this frequency range. The reason is that we are now driving the electrons at their “favorite” frequency; the amplitude of their oscillation is relatively large, and a correspondingly large amount of energy is dissipated by the damping mechanism. In Fig. 9.22, n runs below 1 above the resonance, suggesting that the wave speed exceeds c. As I mentioned earlier, this is no immediate cause for alarm, since energy does not travel at the wave velocity. Moreover, the graph does not include the contributions of other terms in the sum, which add a relatively constant “background” that, in some cases, keeps n > 1on 429 9.4 Absorption and Dispersion wj –2gj wj +2gjwjw1 w2 α n \u0002\u00031 Fig. 9.22 both sides of the resonance. Incidentally, the group velocity can also exceed c in the neighborhood of a resonance, in this model (see Prob. 9.27). If you agree to stay away from the resonances, the damping can be ignored, and the formula for the index of refraction simplifies: n = 1 + Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j fj ω2 j − ω2 . (9.174) For most substances the natural frequencies ωj are scattered all over the spectrum in a rather chaotic fashion. But for transparent materials, the nearest significant resonances typically lie in the ultraviolet, so that ω < ωj. In that case, 1 ω2 j − ω2 = 1 ω2 j (1 − ω2 ω2 j ) −1 ≈ 1 ω2 j (1 + ω2 ω2 j ), and Eq. 9.174 takes the form n = 1 + ( Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j fj ω2 j ) + ω2 ( Nq 2 2mϵ0 ∑ j fj ω4 j ). (9.175) Or, in terms of the wavelength in vacuum (λ = 2πc/ω), n = 1 + A(1 + B λ2 ). (9.176) This is known as Cauchy’s formula; the constant A is called the coefficient of refraction,and B is called the coefficient of dispersion. Cauchy’s equation applies reasonably well to most gases, in the optical region. What I have described in this section is certainly not the complete story of dispersion in nonconducting media. Nevertheless, it does indicate how the damped harmonic motion of electrons can account for the frequency dependence of the index of refraction, and it explains why n is ordinarily a slowly increasing function of ω, with occasional “anomalous” regions where it precipitously drops. 430 9 Electromagnetic Waves Problem 9.24. The relation between wave velocity and group velocity depends on the kind of waves you are talking about. (a) Shallow water is nondispersive; waves travel at a speed that is proportional to the square root of the depth. In deep water, however, the waves can’t “feel” all the way down to the bottom – they behave as though the depth were proportional to λ.(Actually,the distinction between “shallow”and “deep”itself depends on the wavelength: If the depth is less than λ, the water is “shallow”; if it is substantially greater than λ, the water is “deep.”) Show that the wave velocity of deep-water waves is twice the group velocity. (b) In quantum mechanics, a free particle of mass m traveling in the x direction is described by thewavefunction Ψ(x, t) = Aei(px−Et)/ℏ, where p is the momentum and E = p2/2m is the kinetic energy. Calculate the group velocity and the wave velocity. Which one corresponds to the classical speed of the particle? Note that the wave velocity is half the group velocity. Problem 9.25. If you take the model in Ex. 4.1 at face value, what natural frequency do you get? Put in the actual numbers. Where, in the electromagnetic spectrum, does this lie, assuming theradiusoftheatom is 0.5 Å? Find the coefficients of refraction and dispersion, and compare them with the measured values for hydrogen at 0◦C and atmospheric pressure: A = 1.36 × 10−4, B = 7.7 × 10−15 m2. Problem 9.26. Find the width of the anomalous dispersion region for the case of a single resonance at frequency ω0. Assume γ ≪ ω0. Show that the index of refraction assumes its maximum and minimum values at points where the absorption coefficient is at half-maximum. Problem 9.27. Starting with Eq. 9.172, calculate the group velocity, assuming there is only one resonance, at ω0. Use a computer to graph y ≡ vg/c as a function of x ≡ (ω/ω0)2,from x = 0 to 2, (a) for γ = 0, and (b) for γ = (0.1)ω0.Let (Nq2)/(2mϵ0ω2 0) = 0.003. Note that the group velocity can exceed c. 9.5 Guided Waves 9.5.1 Wave Guides So far, we have dealt with plane waves of infinite extent; now we consider electromagnetic waves confined to the interior of a hollow pipe, or wave guide (Fig. 9.23). We’ll assume the wave guide is a perfect conductor, so that E = 0 and B = 0 inside the material itself, and hence the boundary conditions at the inner wall are26 26 See Eq. 9.141 and Prob. 7.47. In a perfect conductor, E = 0, and hence (by Faraday’s law) ∂B/∂t = 0. Assuming the magnetic field started out zero, then, it will remain so. 431 9.5 Guided Waves x z y Fig. 9.23 (i) E ∥ = 0, (ii) B⊥ = 0. ⎫⎪⎬ ⎪ ⎭ (9.177) Free charges and currents 27 will be induced on the surface in such a way as to enforce these constraints. We are interested in monochromatic waves that propagate down the tube, so E and B have the generic form (i) ˜E(x, y, z, t) = ˜E0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt), (ii) ˜B(x, y, z, t) = ˜B0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt). ⎫⎪⎬ ⎪ ⎭ (9.178) (For the cases of interest, k is real, so I shall dispense with its tilde.) The electric and magnetic fields must, of course, satisfy Maxwell’s equations, in the interior of the wave guide: (i) ∇ · E = 0, (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × B = 1 c2 ∂E ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.179) The problem, then, is to find functions ˜E0 and ˜B0 such that the fields (Eq. 9.178) obey the differential equations (Eq. 9.179), subject to boundary conditions (Eq. 9.177). As we shall soon see, confined waves are not (in general) transverse; in order to fit the boundary conditions we shall have to include longitudinal components (Ez and Bz):28 ˜E0 = Exˆx + Eyˆy + Ezˆz, ˜B0 = Bxˆx + Byˆy + Bzˆz, (9.180) where each of the components is a function of x and y. Putting this into Maxwell’s equations (iii) and (iv), we obtain (Prob. 9.28a) 27 In Section 9.4.2 I argued that there can be no surface currents in an ohmic conductor (with finite conductivity). But there are volume currents, extending in (roughly) to the skin depth. As the conductivity increases, they are squeezed into a thinner and thinner layer, and in the limit of a perfect conductor they become true surface currents. See footnote 22. 28 To avoid cumbersome notation, I leave the subscript 0 and the tilde off the individual components. 432 9 Electromagnetic Waves (i) ∂Ey ∂x − ∂Ex ∂y = iωBz,(iv) ∂By ∂x − ∂Bx ∂y = − iω c2 Ez, (ii) ∂Ez ∂y − ikEy = iωBx,(v) ∂Bz ∂y − ikBy = − iω c2 Ex, (iii) ikEx − ∂Ez ∂x = iωBy,(vi) ikBx − ∂Bz ∂x = − iω c2 Ey. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.181) Equations (ii), (iii), (v), and (vi) can be solved for Ex, Ey, Bx,and By: (i) Ex = i (ω/c)2 − k2 (k ∂Ez ∂x + ω ∂Bz ∂y ), (ii) Ey = i (ω/c)2 − k2 (k ∂Ez ∂y − ω ∂Bz ∂x ), (iii) Bx = i (ω/c)2 − k2 (k ∂Bz ∂x − ω c2 ∂Ez ∂y ), (iv) By = i (ω/c)2 − k2 (k ∂Bz ∂y + ω c2 ∂Ez ∂x ). ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.182) It suffices, then, to determine the longitudinal components Ez and Bz;if we knew those, we could quickly calculate all the others, just by differentiating. Inserting Eq. 9.182 into the remaining Maxwell equations (Prob. 9.28b) yields uncoupled equations for Ez and Bz: (i) [ ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 + (ω/c)2 − k2]Ez = 0, (ii) [ ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 + (ω/c)2 − k2]Bz = 0. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.183) If Ez = 0, we call these TE (“transverse electric”) waves;if Bz = 0, they are called TM (“transverse magnetic”) waves; if both Ez = 0and Bz = 0, we call them TEM waves.29 It turns out that TEM waves cannot occur in a hollow wave guide. Proof. If Ez = 0, Gauss’s law (Eq. 9.179i)says ∂Ex ∂x + ∂Ey ∂y = 0, and if Bz = 0, Faraday’s law (Eq. 9.179iii) says ∂Ey ∂x − ∂Ex ∂y = 0. Indeed, the vector ˜E0 in Eq. 9.180 has zero divergence and zero curl. It can therefore be written as the gradient of a scalar potential that satis- fies Laplace’s equation. But the boundary condition on E (Eq. 9.177) 29 In the case of TEM waves (including the unconfined plane waves of Section 9.2), k = ω/c, Eqs. 9.182 are indeterminate, and you have to go back to Eqs. 9.181. 433 9.5 Guided Waves requires that the surface be an equipotential, and since Laplace’s equation admits no local maxima or minima (Section 3.1.4), this means that the potential is constant throughout, and hence the electric field is zero – no wave at all. □ Notice that this argument applies only to a completely empty pipe – if you run a separate conductor down the middle, the potential at its surface need not be the same as on the outer wall, and hence a nontrivial potential is possible. We’ll see an example of this in Section 9.5.3. ! Problem 9.28. (a) Derive Eqs. 9.181, and from these obtain Eqs. 9.182. (b) Put Eqs. 9.182 into Maxwell’s equations (i) and (ii) to obtain Eqs. 9.183.Check that youget the same results using (i) and (iv) of Eqs. 9.181. 9.5.2 TE Waves in a Rectangular Wave Guide Suppose we have a wave guide of rectangular shape (Fig. 9.24), with height a and width b, and we are interested in the propagation of TE waves. The problem is to solve Eq. 9.183ii, subject to the boundary condition 9.177ii. We’ll do it by separation of variables. Let Bz(x, y) = X (x)Y (y), so that Y d2X dx2 + X d2Y dy2 + [(ω/c)2 − k2]XY = 0. Divide by XY , and note that the x-and y-dependent terms must be constants: (i) 1 X d2X dx2 = −k2 x, (ii) 1 Y d2Y dy2 = −k2 y, (9.184) y z x a b Fig. 9.24 434 9 Electromagnetic Waves with − k2 x − k2 y + (ω/c)2 − k2 = 0. (9.185) The general solution to Eq. 9.184i is X (x) = A sin(kxx) + B cos(kxx). But the boundary conditions require that Bx – and hence also (Eq. 9.182iii) dX /dx – vanishes at x = 0and x = a.So A = 0, and kx = mπ/a (m = 0, 1, 2, ...). (9.186) The same goes for Y , with ky = nπ/b (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), (9.187) and we conclude that Bz = B0 cos(mπx/a) cos(nπy/b). (9.188) This solution is called the TEmn mode. (The first index is conventionally associated with the larger dimension, so we assume a ≥ b.Bythe way,at least one of the indices must be nonzero – see Prob. 9.29.) The wave number (k) is obtained by putting Eqs. 9.186 and 9.187 into Eq. 9.185: k = √(ω/c)2 − π2[(m/a)2 + (n/b)2]. (9.189) If ω < cπ√(m/a)2 + (n/b)2 ≡ ωmn, (9.190) the wave number is imaginary, and instead of a traveling wave we have exponentially attenuated fields (Eq. 9.178). For this reason, ωmn is called the cutoff frequency for the mode in question. The lowest cutoff frequency for a given wave guide occurs for the mode TE10: ω10 = cπ/a. (9.191) Frequencies less than this will not propagate at all. The wave number can be written more simply in terms of the cutoff frequency: k = 1 c √ω2 − ω2 mn. (9.192) The wave velocity is v = ω k = c √1 − (ωmn/ω)2 , (9.193) which is greater than c. However (see Prob. 9.31), the energy carried by the wave travels at the group velocity (Eq. 9.152): vg = 1 dk/dω = c √1 − (ωmn/ω)2 < c. (9.194) There’s another way to visualize the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a rectangular pipe, and it serves to illuminate these results. Consider 435 9.5 Guided Waves A z v Wave fronts k\u0007 θ Fig. 9.25 an ordinary plane wave, traveling at an angle θ to the z-axis, and reflecting perfectly off each conducting surface (Fig. 9.25). In the x and y directions, the (multiply reflected) waves interfere to form standing wave patterns, of wavelength λx = 2a/m and λy = 2b/n (hence wave number kx = 2π/λx = πm/a and ky = πn/b), respectively. Meanwhile, in the z direction there remains a traveling wave, with wave number kz = k. The propagation vector for the “original” plane wave is therefore k′ = πm a ˆx + πn b ˆy + kˆz, and the frequency is ω = c|k′| = c√ k2 + π2[(m/a)2 + (n/b)2] = √(ck)2 + (ωmn)2. Only certain angles will lead to one of the allowed standing wave patterns: cos θ = k |k′| = √1 − (ωmn/ω)2. The plane wave travels at speed c, but because it is going at an angle θ to the z-axis, its net velocity down the wave guide is vg = c cos θ = c√ 1 − (ωmn/ω)2. The wave velocity, on the other hand, is the speed of the wave fronts (A,say, in Fig. 9.25) down the pipe. Like the intersection of a line of breakers with the beach, they can move much faster than the waves themselves–in fact v = c cos θ = c √1 − (ωmn/ω)2 . Problem 9.29. Show that the mode TE00 cannot occur in a rectangular wave guide. [Hint: In this case ω/c = k,so Eqs. 9.182 are indeterminate, and you must go back to Eq. 9.181.Show that Bz is a constant, and hence – applying Faraday’s law in integral form to a cross section – that Bz = 0, so this would be a TEM mode.] 436 9 Electromagnetic Waves Problem 9.30. Consider a rectangular wave guide with dimensions 2.28 cm × 1.01 cm. What TE modes will propagate in this wave guide, if the driving frequency is 1.70 × 1010 Hz? Suppose you wanted to excite only one TE mode; what range of frequencies could you use? What are the corresponding wavelengths (in open space)? Problem 9.31. Confirm that the energy in the TEmn mode travels at the group velocity. [Hint: Find the time averaged Poynting vector ⟨S⟩ and the energy density ⟨u⟩ (use Prob. 9.12 if you wish). Integrate over the cross section of the wave guide to get the energy per unit time and per unit length carried by the wave, and take their ratio.] Problem 9.32. Work out the theory of TM modes for a rectangular wave guide. In particular, find the longitudinal electric field, the cutoff frequencies, and the wave and group velocities. Find the ratio of the lowest TM cutoff frequency to the lowest TE cutoff frequency, for a given wave guide. [Caution: What is the lowest TM mode?] 9.5.3 The Coaxial Transmission Line In Section 9.5.1 I showed that a hollow wave guide cannot support TEM waves. But a coaxial transmission line, consisting of a long straight wire of radius a, surrounded by a cylindrical conducting sheath of radius b (Fig. 9.26), does admit modes with Ez = 0and Bz = 0. In this case Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 9.181) yield k = ω/c (9.195) (so the waves travel at speed c, and are nondispersive), cBy = Ex and cBx = −Ey (9.196) (so E and B are mutually perpendicular), and (together with ∇ · E = 0, ∇ · B = 0) ∂Ex ∂x + ∂Ey ∂y = 0, ∂Ey ∂x − ∂Ex ∂y = 0, ∂Bx ∂x + ∂By ∂y = 0, ∂By ∂x − ∂Bx ∂y = 0. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.197) These are precisely the equations of electrostatics and magnetostatics,for empty space, in two dimensions; the solution with cylindrical symmetry can z a b Fig. 9.26 437 More Problems on Chapter 9 be borrowed directly from the case of an infinite line charge and an infinite straight current, respectively: E0(s, φ) = A s ˆs, B0(s, φ) = A cs ˆφ, (9.198) for some constant A. Substituting these into Eq. 9.178, and taking the real part, E(s, φ, z, t) = A cos(kz − ωt) s ˆs, B(s, φ, z, t) = A cos(kz − ωt) cs ˆφ. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (9.199) Problem 9.33.

[The naïve explanation for the pressure of light offered in Section 9.2.3 has its flaws, as you discovered if you worked Prob. 9.11. Here’s another account, due originally to Planck.30] A plane wave traveling through vacuum in the z direction encounters a perfect conductor occupying the region z ≥ 0, and reflects back: E(z, t) = E0[cos(kz − ωt) − cos(kz + ωt)]ˆx (z < 0).

Light of (angular) frequency ω passes from medium 1, through a slab (thick- ness d) of medium 2, and into medium 3 (for instance, from water through glass into air, as in Fig. 9.27).

Assuming it’s a monochromatic plane wave and that it strikes the glass at normal incidence, find the minimum and maximum transmission coefficients (Eq. 9.201). You can see the fish clearly; how well can it see you? ! Problem 9.41. According to Snell’s law, when light passes from an optically dense medium into a less dense one (n1 > n2), the propagation vector k bends away from the normal (Fig. 9.28). In particular, if the light is incident at the critical angle θc ≡ sin−1(n2/n1), (9.202) then θT = 90◦, and the transmitted ray just grazes the surface. If θI exceeds θc, there is no refracted ray at all, only a reflected one (this is the phenomenon of total internal reflection, on which light pipes and fiber optics are based). But the fields are not zero in medium 2; what we get is a so-called evanescent wave, which is rapidly attenuated and transports no energy into medium 2.31 A quick way to construct the evanescent wave is simply to quote the results of Section 9.3.3, with kT = ωn2/c and kT = kT (sin θT ˆx + cos θT ˆz); the only change is that sin θT = n1 n2 sin θI is now greater than 1,and cos θT = √1 − sin2 θT = i√sin2 θT − 1 is imaginary. (Obviously, θT can no longer be interpreted as an angle!) 31 The evanescent fields can be detected by placing a second interface a short distance to the right of the first; in a close analog to quantum mechanical tunneling, the wave crosses the gap and reassembles to the right. See F. Albiol, S. Navas, and M. V. Andres, Am. J. Phys. 61, 165 (1993). 440 9 Electromagnetic Waves z x kI kT I T 1 2 θ θ Fig. 9.28 (a) Show that ˜ET (r, t) = ˜E0T e−κzei(kx−ωt), (9.203) where κ ≡ ω c √(n1 sin θI )2 − n2 2 and k ≡ ωn1 c sin θI .

(b) Noting that α (Eq. 9.109) is now imaginary, use Eq. 9.110 to calculate the reflection coeffi- cient for polarization parallel to the plane of incidence.

Find the associated electric and magnetic fields. 441 More Problems on Chapter 9 Problem 9.43. Energy conservation at the interface (Eqs. 9.114–9.118) is a little more subtle than I suggested in Section 9.3.3. Consider a volume V (with surface S, straddling the boundary. The energy per unit time transported by the fields out of this volume is given by Poynting’s theorem (Eq. 8.9): ∮ S S · da = 0 (at least, when time averaged over a cycle), since there is no energy source or sink in V. (a) Choose for V an infinitesimally thin disc extending just barely to either side of the interface. Show that II = IR + IT (Eq. 9.118), where these terms are defined by Eqs. 9.114 and 9.115. Beware: In medium 1 there are two superimposed fields: S = 1 μ0 [(EI + ER) × (BI + BR)] = SI + SR + 1 μ0 [(EI × BR) + ( ER × BI )]; what happens to the cross terms? (b) In practice we don’t use plane waves (which would extend to infinity) but narrow beams – perhaps from a laser. Let’s pretend that the plane waves could somehow be confined to cylindrical tubes, forming the beams.32 This time use a balloon-shaped volume that is punctured in three places by the incident, reflected, and transmitted beams (in fact, you might as well distort the surface S so it lies perpendicular to each beam at the puncture). Again, confirm Eq. 9.118; you won’t need to worry about overlapping fields, but you do need to figure out the relative cross-sectional areas of the three beams. Problem 9.44. (Optical tweezers)In Prob. 4.33 you showed that it is impossible to trap a neutral (but polarizable) particle in an electrostatic field. However, it is possible if you use time- dependent electromagnetic fields, such as a laser beam. Show that the force can be written in the form F = α [ 1 2 ∇E2 + ∂ ∂t (E × B)], (9.207) where α is the polarizability. [Assume that the particle as a whole is at rest (or at any rate moving at much less than the speed of light), but its internal parts may be moving very rapidly. Treat it as an electric dipole at point r, consisting of charges ±q separated by a displacement ϵ.Thus you may drop dr/dt butyou mustkeep dϵ/dt.] In a light beam, for instance, the second term oscillates rapidly, and averages to zero, so the effective force is F = α 2 ∇E2, (9.208) just as in the static case (Prob. 4.33). But in the time-dependent régime E2 can have a local maximum (for example, at the focal point of a laser beam), and this allows for optical trapping (“tweezers”). 32 That’s actually impossible; a real light beam is much more complicated. See J. Lekner, Theory of Electromagnetic Beams, Morgan and Claypool, San Rafael (2020). 10 Potentials and Fields 10.1 The Potential Formulation 10.1.1 Scalar and Vector Potentials In this chapter we seek the general solution to Maxwell’s equations, (i) ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ, (iii) ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , (ii) ∇ · B = 0, (iv) ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (10.1) Given the sources ρ(r, t) and J(r, t), what are the fields E(r, t) and B(r, t)?In the static case, Coulomb’s law and the Biot–Savart law provide the answer. What we’re looking for, then, is the generalization of those laws to time- dependent configurations. This is not an easy problem, and it pays to begin by representing the fields in terms of potentials. In electrostatics ∇×E = 0 allowed us to write E as the gradient of a scalar potential: E = −∇V .Inelectrodynamics this is no longer possible, because the curl of E is nonzero. But B remains divergenceless, so we can still write B = ∇ × A, (10.2) as in magnetostatics. Putting this into Faraday’s law (iii) yields ∇ × E = − ∂ ∂t (∇ × A), or ∇ × (E + ∂A ∂t ) = 0. Here is a quantity, unlike E alone, whose curl does vanish; it can therefore be written as the gradient of a scalar: E + ∂A ∂t = −∇V . In terms of V and A, then, E = −∇V − ∂A ∂t . (10.3) This reduces to the old form, of course, when A is constant. 443 10.1 The Potential Formulation The potential representation (Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3) automatically fulfills the two homogeneous Maxwell equations, (ii) and (iii). How about Gauss’s law (i) and the Ampère/Maxwell law (iv)? Putting Eq. 10.3 into (i), we find that ∇2V + ∂ ∂t (∇ · A) = − 1 ϵ0 ρ; (10.4) this replaces Poisson’s equation (to which it reduces in the static case). Putting Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 into (iv) yields ∇ × (∇ × A) = μ0J − μ0ϵ0∇( ∂V ∂t ) − μ0ϵ0 ∂2A ∂t2 , or, using the vector identity ∇ × (∇ × A) = ∇(∇ · A) − ∇ 2A, and rearranging the terms a bit, (∇ 2A − μ0ϵ0 ∂2A ∂t2 ) − ∇(∇ · A + μ0ϵ0 ∂V ∂t ) = −μ0J. (10.5) Equations 10.4 and 10.5 contain all the information in Maxwell’s equations. Example 10.1. Find the charge and current distributions that would give rise to the potentials V = 0, A = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ μ0k 4c (ct −|x|)2ˆz for |x| < ct, 0 for |x| > ct, where k is a constant, and (of course) c = 1/ √ϵ0μ0. Solution. First we’ll determine the electric and magnetic fields, using Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3: E = − ∂A ∂t = − μ0k 2 (ct −|x|)ˆz, B = ∇ × A = − μ0k 4c ∂ ∂x (ct −|x|)2ˆy = ± μ0k 2c (ct −|x|)ˆy (plus, for x > 0; minus, for x < 0). These are for |x| < ct; when |x| > ct, E = B = 0 (Fig. 10.1). Calculating every derivative in sight, I find 2 μ0kct μ0kt μ0kt x Ez \u0002 2 \u0002 2 x By \u0002ct ct \u0002ct ct Fig. 10.1 444 10 Potentials and Fields ∇ · E = 0, ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × E = ∓ μ0k 2 ˆy, ∇ × B = − μ0k 2c ˆz, ∂E ∂t = − μ0kc 2 ˆz, ∂B ∂t = ± μ0k 2 ˆy. As you can easily check, Maxwell’s equations are all satisfied, with ρ and J both zero. Notice, however, that B has a discontinuity at x = 0, and this signals the presence of a surface current K in the yz plane; boundary condition (iv) in Eq. 7.73 gives ktˆy = K × ˆx, and hence K = ktˆz. Evidently, we have here a uniform surface current flowing in the z direction over the plane x = 0, whichstartsupat t = 0, and increases in proportion to t. Notice that the “news” travels out (in both directions) at the speed of light: for points |x| > ct the message (“current is now flowing”) has not yet arrived, so the fields are zero. Problem 10.1. Show that the differential equations for V and A (Eqs. 10.4 and 10.5)can be written in the more symmetrical form □ 2V + ∂L ∂t = − 1 ϵ0 ρ, □ 2A − ∇L = −μ0J, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (10.6) where □ 2 ≡∇2 − μ0ϵ0 ∂2 ∂t2 and L ≡ ∇ · A + μ0ϵ0 ∂V ∂t . Problem 10.2. For the configuration in Ex. 10.1, consider a rectangular box of length l, width w, and height h, situated a distance d above the yz plane (Fig. 10.2). (a) Find the energy in the box at time t1 = d/c,and at t2 = (d + h)/c. x z hw y d l Fig. 10.2 445 10.1 The Potential Formulation (b) Find the Poynting vector, and determine the energy per unit time flowing into the box during the interval t1 < t < t2. (c) Integrate the result in (b) from t1 to t2, and confirm that the increase in energy (part (a)) equals the net influx. 10.1.2 Gauge Transformations Equations 10.4 and 10.5 are ugly, and you might be inclined to abandon the potential formulation altogether. However, we have succeeded in reducing six problems – finding E and B (three components each) – down to four: V (one component) and A (three more). Moreover, Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 do not uniquely define the potentials; we are free to impose extra conditions on V and A, as long as nothing happens to E and B. Let’s work out precisely what this gauge freedom entails. Suppose we have two sets of potentials, (V , A) and (V ′, A′), which correspond to the same electric and magnetic fields. By how much can they differ? Write A′ = A + α and V ′ = V + β. Since the two As give the same B, their curls must be equal, and hence ∇ × α = 0. We can therefore write α as the gradient of a scalar: α = ∇λ. The two potentials also give the same E,so ∇β + ∂α ∂t = 0, or ∇(β + ∂λ ∂t ) = 0. The term in parentheses is therefore independent of position (it could, however, depend on time); call it k(t): β = − ∂λ ∂t + k(t). Actually, we might as well absorb k(t) into λ, defining a new λ by adding∫ t 0 k(t′) dt′ to the old one. This will not affect the gradient of λ; it just adds k(t) to ∂λ/∂t. It follows that A′ = A + ∇λ, V ′ = V − ∂λ ∂t . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (10.7) Conclusion: For any old scalar function λ(r, t), we can with impunity add ∇λ to A, provided we simultaneously subtract ∂λ/∂t from V . This will 446 10 Potentials and Fields not affect the physical quantities E and B. Such changes in V and A are called gauge transformations. They can be exploited to adjust the divergence of A, with a view to simplifying the “ugly” equations 10.4 and 10.5. In magnetostatics, it was best to choose ∇ · A = 0(Eq. 5.63); in electrodynamics, the situation is not so clear-cut, and the most con- venient gauge depends to some extent on the problem at hand. There are many famous gauges in the literature; I’ll show you the two most popular ones. Problem 10.3. (a) Find the fields, and the charge and current distributions, corresponding to V (r, t) = 0, A(r, t) = − 1 4πϵ0 qt r2 ˆr. (b) Use the gauge function λ = − (1/4πϵ0)(qt/r) to transform the potentials, and com- ment on the result. Problem 10.4. Suppose V = 0 and A = A0 sin(kx − ωt)ˆy,where A0, ω,and k are constants. Find E and B, and check that they satisfy Maxwell’s equations in vacuum. What condition must you impose on ω and k? 10.1.3 Coulomb Gauge and Lorenz Gauge The Coulomb Gauge. As in magnetostatics, we pick ∇ · A = 0. (10.8) With this, Eq. 10.4 becomes ∇ 2V = − 1 ϵ0 ρ. (10.9) This is Poisson’s equation, and we already know how to solve it: setting V = 0 at infinity, V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, t) dτ′. (10.10) There is a very peculiar thing about the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge: it is determined by the distribution of charge right now.If I move an electron in my laboratory, the potential V on the moon immediately records this change. That sounds particularly odd in the light of special relativity, which allows no message to travel faster than c. The point is that Vby itself is not a physically measurable quantity – all the man in the moon can measure is E, and that involves A as well (Eq. 10.3). Somehow it is built into the vector potential (in the Coulomb gauge) that whereas V instantaneously 447 10.1 The Potential Formulation reflects all changes in ρ, the combination −∇V − (∂A/∂t) does not; E will change only after sufficient time has elapsed for the “news” to arrive. 1 The advantage of the Coulomb gauge is that the scalar potential is particularly simple to calculate; the disadvantage (apart from the acausal appearance of V ) is that A is particularly difficult to calculate. The differ- ential equation for A (Eq. 10.5) in the Coulomb gauge reads ∇2A − μ0ϵ0 ∂2A ∂t2 = −μ0J + μ0ϵ0∇( ∂V ∂t ). (10.11) The Lorenz gauge. In the Lorenz 2 gauge, we pick ∇ · A = −μ0ϵ0 ∂V ∂t . (10.12) This is designed to eliminate the middle term in Eq. 10.5 (in the language of Prob. 10.1,itsets L = 0). With this, ∇ 2A − μ0ϵ0 ∂2A ∂t2 = −μ0J. (10.13) Meanwhile, the differential equation for V (Eq. 10.4) becomes ∇ 2V − μ0ϵ0 ∂2V ∂t2 = − 1 ϵ0 ρ. (10.14) The virtue of the Lorenz gauge is that it treats V and A on an equal footing: the same differential operator ∇ 2 − μ0ϵ0 ∂2 ∂t2 ≡ □ 2 (10.15) (called the d’Alembertian) occurs in both equations: (i) □ 2V = − 1 ϵ0 ρ, (ii) □2A = −μ0J. (10.16) This democratic treatment of V and A is especially nice in the context of special relativity, where the d’Alembertian is the natural generalization of the Laplacian, and Eqs. 10.16 can be regarded as four-dimensional versions of Poisson’s equation. In this same spirit, the homogeneous wave equation □ 2f = 0 might be regarded as the four-dimensional version of Laplace’s equation. In the Lorenz gauge, V and A satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation, with a “source” term (in place of zero) on the right. From now on, I shall use the Lorenz gauge exclusively, and the whole of electrodynamics 1 See O. L. Brill and B. Goodman. Am. J. Phys. 35, 832 (1967); J. D. Jackson, Am.J.Phys. 70, 917 (2001). 2 Until recently, it was spelled “Lorentz,” in honor of the Dutch physicist H. A. Lorentz, but it is now attributed to L. V. Lorenz, the Dane. See J. Van Bladel, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine 33(2), 69 (1991); J. D. Jackson and L. B. Okun, Rev. Mod. Phys. 73, 663 (2001). 448 10 Potentials and Fields reduces to the problem of solving the inhomogeneous wave equation for a specified source. Problem 10.5. Which of the potentials in Ex. 10.1, Prob. 10.3,and Prob. 10.4 are in the Coulomb gauge? Which are in the Lorenz gauge? (Notice that these gauges are not mutually exclusive.) Problem 10.6. In Chapter 5, I showed that it is always possible to pick a vector potential whose divergence is zero (the Coulomb gauge). Show that it is always possible to choose ∇ · A = −μ0ϵ0(∂V /∂t), as required for the Lorenz gauge, assuming you know how to solve the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16). Is it always possible to pick V = 0? How about A = 0? Problem 10.7. A time-dependent point charge q(t) at the origin, ρ(r, t) = q(t)δ3(r),is fed by a current J(r, t) = −(1/4π)( ˙q/r2)ˆr,where ˙q ≡ dq/dt. (a) Check that charge is conserved, by confirming that the continuity equation is obeyed. (b) Find the scalar and vector potentials in the Coulomb gauge. If you get stuck, try working on (c) first. (c) Find the fields, and check that they satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations.3 10.1.4 Lorentz Force Law in Potential Form It4 is illuminating to express the Lorentz force law in terms of potentials: F = dp dt = q(E + v × B) = q[−∇V − ∂A ∂t + v × (∇ × A)], (10.17) where p = mv is the momentum of the particle. Now, product rule 4 says ∇(v · A) = v × (∇ × A) + (v · ∇)A (v, the velocity of the particle, is a function of time, but not of position). Thus dp dt = −q[ ∂A ∂t + (v · ∇)A + ∇(V − v · A)]. (10.18) The combination [ ∂A ∂t + (v · ∇)A] is called the convective derivative of A, and written dA/dt (total derivative). It represents the time rate of change of A at the (moving) location of the particle. For suppose that at time t the particle is at point r, where the potential is A(r, t); a moment dt later it is at r + v dt, where the potential is A(r + v dt, t + dt).The change in A, then, is 3 P. R. Berman, Am.J.Phys. 76, 48 (2008). 4 This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 449 10.1 The Potential Formulation dA = A(r + v dt, t + dt) − A(r, t) = ( ∂A ∂x ) (vx dt) + ( ∂A ∂y ) (vy dt) + ( ∂A ∂z ) (vz dt) + ( ∂A ∂t ) dt, so dA dt = ∂A ∂t + (v · ∇)A. (10.19) As the particle moves, the potential it “feels” changes for two distinct reasons: first, because the potential varies with time, and second, because it is now in a new location, where A is different because of its variation in space. Hence the two terms in Eq. 10.19. With the aid of the convective derivative, the Lorentz force law reads: d dt (p + qA) = −∇[q(V − v · A)]. (10.20) This is reminiscent of the standard formula from mechanics, for the motion of a particle whose potential energy U is a specified function of position: dp dt = −∇U. Playing the role of p is the so-called canonical momentum, pcan = p + qA, (10.21) while the part of U is taken by the velocity-dependent quantity Uvel = q(V − v · A). (10.22) A similar argument (Prob. 10.9) gives the rate of change of the particle’s energy: d dt (T + qV ) = ∂ ∂t [q(V − v · A)], (10.23) where T = 1 2 mv2 is its kinetic energy and qV is its potential energy (the derivative on the right acts only on V and A, not on v). Curiously, the same quantity 5 Uvel appears on the right-hand side of both equations. The parallel between Eq. 10.20 and Eq. 10.23 invites us to interpret A as a kind of “potential momentum” per unit charge, just as V is potential energy per unit charge.6 Problem 10.8. The vector potential for a uniform magnetostatic field is A = − 1 2 (r × B) (Prob. 5.27). Show that dA/dt = − 1 2 (v × B), in this case, and confirm that Eq. 10.20 yields the correct equation of motion. Problem 10.9. Derive Eq. 10.23.[Hint: Start by dotting v into Eq. 10.17.] 5 I don’t know what to call Uvel – it’s not potential energy, exactly (that would be qV ). 6 There are other arguments for this interpretation, which Maxwell himself favored, and many modern authors advocate. For a fascinating discussion, see M. D. Semon and J. R. Taylor, Am. J. Phys. 64, 1361 (1996). Incidentally, it is the canonical angular momentum (derived from pcan), not the mechanical portion alone, that is quantized – see R. H. Young, Am. J. Phys. 66, 1043 (1998). 450 10 Potentials and Fields 10.2 Continuous Distributions 10.2.1 Retarded Potentials In the static case, Eq. 10.16 reduces to (four copies of) Poisson’s equation, ∇2V = − 1 ϵ0 ρ, ∇ 2A = −μ0J, with the familiar solutions V (r) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′) dτ′, A(r) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′) dτ′, (10.24) where , as always, is the distance from the source point r′ to the field point r (Fig. 10.3). Now, electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light. In the nonstatic case, therefore, it’s not the status of the source right now that matters, but rather its condition at some earlier time tr (called the retarded time) when the “message” left. Since this message must travel a distance , the delay is /c: tr ≡ t − c . (10.25) The natural generalization of Eq. 10.24 for nonstatic sources is therefore V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, tr) dτ′, A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′, tr) dτ′. (10.26) Here ρ(r′, tr) is the charge density that prevailed at point r′ at the retarded time tr. Because the integrands are evaluated at the retarded time, these are called retarded potentials. (I speak of “the” retarded time, but of course more distant parts of the charge distribution have earlier retarded times than nearby ones. It’s just like the night sky: the light we see now left each star at the retarded time corresponding to that star’s distance from the Earth.) Note that the retarded potentials reduce properly to Eq. 10.24 in the static case, for which ρ and J are independent of time. τ Fig. 10.3 451 10.2 Continuous Distributions Well, that all sounds reasonable – and surprisingly simple. But are we sure it’s right? I didn’t actually derive the formulas for V and A (Eq. 10.26); all I did was invoke a heuristic argument (“electromagnetic news travels at the speed of light”) to make them seem plausible.To prove them, I must show that they satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16) and meet the Lorenz condition (Eq. 10.12). In case you think I’m being fussy, let me warn you that if you apply the same logic to the fields you’ll get entirely the wrong answer (see Prob. 10.36 for the correct argument): E(r, t) \u0002 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, tr) 2 ˆ dτ′, B(r, t) \u0002 μ0 4π ∫ J(r′, tr) × ˆ 2 dτ′. Let’s stop and check, then, that the retarded scalar potential satisfies Eq. 10.16; essentially the same argument would serve for the vector poten- tial. 7 I shall leave it for you (Prob. 10.10) to show that the retarded potentials obey the Lorenz condition. Proof. In calculating the Laplacian of V (r, t), the crucial point to notice is that the integrand (in Eq. 10.26) depends on r in two places: explicitly, in the denominator ( = |r − r′|), and implicitly, through tr = t − /c, in the numerator. Thus ∇V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ [(∇ρ) 1 + ρ∇( 1 ) ] dτ′, (10.27) and ∇ρ = ˙ρ∇tr = − 1 c ˙ρ∇ . (10.28) (The dot denotes differentiation with respect to time). 8 Now ∇ = ˆ and ∇(1/ ) = −ˆ/ 2 (Prob. 1.13), so ∇V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ [− ˙ρ c ˆ − ρ ˆ 2 ] dτ′. (10.29) Taking the divergence, ∇ 2V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ { − 1 c [ ˆ · (∇ ˙ρ) + ˙ρ∇ · ( ˆ ) ] − [ ˆ 2 · (∇ρ) + ρ∇ · ( ˆ 2 )]} dτ′. But ∇ ˙ρ = − 1 c ¨ρ∇ = − 1 c ¨ρˆ, as in Eq. 10.28,and ∇ · ( ˆ ) = 1 2 7 I’ll give you the straightforward but cumbersome proof; for a clever indirect argument see M. A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3rd ed., Saunders, Orlando, FL (1995), Sect. 8.1. 8 Note that ∂/∂tr = ∂/∂t, since tr = t − /c and is independent of t. 452 10 Potentials and Fields (Prob. 1.63), whereas ∇ · ( ˆ 2 ) = 4πδ3( ) (Eq. 1.100). So ∇ 2V = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ [ 1 c2 ¨ρ − 4πρδ3( )] dτ′ = 1 c2 ∂2V ∂t2 − 1 ϵ0 ρ(r, t), confirming that the retarded potential (Eq. 10.26) satisfies the inho- mogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16). □ Incidentally, this proof applies equally well to the advanced potentials, Va(r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, ta) dτ′, Aa(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′, ta) dτ′, (10.30) in which the charge and the current densities are evaluated at the advanced time ta ≡ t + c . (10.31) A few signs are changed, but the final result is unaffected. Although the advanced potentials are entirely consistent with Maxwell’s equations, they violate the most sacred tenet in all of physics: the principle of causality. They suggest that the potentials now depend on what the charge and the current distribution will be at some time in the future – the effect, in other words, precedes the cause. Although the advanced potentials are of some theoretical interest, they have no direct physical significance.9 Example 10.2. An infinite straight wire carries the current I (t) = ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0for t ≤ 0, I0 for t > 0. That is, a constant current I0 is turned on abruptly at t = 0. Find the resulting electric and magnetic fields. Solution. The wire is presumably electrically neutral, so the scalar potential is zero. Let the wire lie along the z-axis (Fig. 10.4); the retarded vector potential at point P is A(s, t) = μ0 4π ˆz ∫ ∞ −∞ I (tr) dz. For t < s/c, the “news” has not yet reached P, and the potential is zero. For t > s/c, only the segment 9 Because the d’Alembertian involves t2 (as opposed to t), the theory itself is time-reversal invariant, and does not distinguish “past” from “future.” Time asymmetry is introduced when we select the retarded potentials in preference to the advanced ones, reflecting the (not unreasonable!) belief that electromagnetic influences propagate forward, not backward, in time. 453 10.2 Continuous Distributions s z I dz P Fig. 10.4 |z|≤ √(ct)2 − s2 (10.32) contributes (outside this range tr is negative, so I (tr) = 0); thus A(s, t) = ( μ0I0 4π ˆz)2 ∫ √(ct)2−s2 0 dz √ s2 + z2 = μ0I0 2π ˆz ln(√s2 + z2 + z)||| √(ct)2−s2 0 = μ0I0 2π ln( ct + √(ct)2 − s2 s )ˆz. The electric field is E(s, t) = − ∂A ∂t = − μ0I0c 2π√(ct)2 − s2 ˆz, and the magnetic field is B(s, t) = ∇ × A = − ∂Az ∂s ˆφ = μ0I0 2πs ct √(ct)2 − s2 ˆφ. Notice that as t →∞ we recover the static case: E = 0, B = (μ0I0/2πs) ˆφ. ! Problem 10.10. Confirm that the retarded potentials satisfy the Lorenz gauge condition. [Hint: First show that ∇ · ( J ) = 1 (V · J) + 1 (∇′ · J) − ∇′ · ( J ), where ∇ denotes derivatives with respect to r,and ∇′ denotes derivatives with respect to r′. Next, noting that J(r′, t − /c) depends on r′ both explicitly and through ,whereas it depends on r only through ,confirmthat ∇ · J = − 1 c ˙J · (∇ ), ∇′ · J = − ˙ρ − 1 c ˙J · (∇′ ). Usethistocalculate thedivergenceof A (Eq. 10.26).] ! Problem 10.11. (a) Suppose the wire in Ex. 10.2 carries a linearly increasing current I (t) = kt, for t > 0. Find the electric and magnetic fields generated. 454 10 Potentials and Fields (b) Do the same for the case of a sudden burst of current: I (t) = q0δ(t). Problem 10.12. A piece of wire bent into a loop, as shown in Fig. 10.5, carries a current that increases linearly with time: I (t) = kt (−∞ < t < ∞). Calculate the retarded vector potential A at the center. Find the electric field at the center. Why does this (neutral) wire produce an electric field? (Why can’t you determine the magnetic field from this expression for A?) a b x y I Fig. 10.5 10.2.2 Jefimenko’s Equations Given the retarded potentials V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, tr) dτ′, A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′, tr) dτ′, (10.33) it is, in principle, a straightforward matter to determine the fields: E = −∇V − ∂A ∂t , B = ∇ × A. (10.34) But the details are not entirely trivial because, as I mentioned earlier, the integrands depend on r both explicitly, through = |r − r′| in the denominator, and implicitly, through the retarded time tr = t − /c in the argument of the numerator. I already calculated the gradient of V (Eq. 10.29); the time derivative of A is easy: ∂A ∂t = μ0 4π ∫ ˙J dτ′. (10.35) Putting them together (and using c 2 = 1/μ0ϵ0), E(r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ [ ρ(r′, tr) 2 ˆ + ˙ρ(r′, tr) c ˆ − ˙J(r′, tr) c2 ] dτ′. (10.36) This is the time-dependent generalization of Coulomb’s law, to which it reduces in the static case (where the second and third terms drop out and the first term loses its dependence on tr). 455 10.2 Continuous Distributions As for B, the curl of A contains two terms: ∇ × A = μ0 4π ∫ [ 1 (∇ × J) − J × ∇( 1 ) ] dτ′. Now (∇ × J)x = ∂Jz ∂y − ∂Jy ∂z , and ∂Jz ∂y = ˙J z ∂tr ∂y = − 1 c ˙J z ∂ ∂y , so (∇ × J)x = − 1 c ( ˙J z ∂ ∂y − ˙J y ∂ ∂z ) = 1 c [ ˙J × (∇ )]x. But ∇ = ˆ (Prob. 1.13), so ∇ × J = 1 c ˙J × ˆ. (10.37) Meanwhile, ∇(1/ ) = −ˆ/ 2 (again, Prob. 1.13), and hence B(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ [ J(r′, tr) 2 + ˙J(r′, tr) c ] × ˆ dτ′. (10.38) This is the time-dependent generalization of the Biot–Savart law, to which it reduces in the static case. Equations 10.36 and 10.38 are the (causal) solutions to Maxwell’s equations. For some reason, they do not seem to have been published until quite recently – the earliest explicit statement of which I am aware was by Oleg Jefimenko, in 1966. 10 In practice Jefimenko’s equations are of limited utility, since it is typically easier to calculate the retarded potentials and differentiate them, rather than going directly to the fields. Nevertheless, they provide a satisfying sense of closure to the theory. They also help to clarify an observation I made in the previous section: to get to the retarded potentials, all you do is replace t by tr in the electrostatic and magnetostatic formulas, but in the case of the fields not only is time replaced by retarded time, but completely new terms (involving derivatives of ρ and J) appear. And Jefimenko’s equations provide surprisingly strong support for the quasistatic approximation (see Prob. 10.14). 10 O. D.

Show that E(r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, t) 2 ˆ dτ′; that is, Coulomb’s law holds, with the charge density evaluated at the nonretarded time. Problem 10.14. Suppose the current density changes slowly enough that we can (to good approximation) ignore all higher derivatives in the Taylor expansion J(tr) = J(t) + (tr − t) ˙J(t) + ··· (for clarity, I suppress the r-dependence, which is not at issue). Show that a fortuitous cancela- tion in Eq. 10.38 yields B(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′, t) × ˆ 2 dτ′. That is, the Biot–Savart law holds, with J evaluated at the nonretarded time. This means that the quasistatic approximation is actually much better than we had any right to expect: the two errors involved (neglecting retardation and dropping the second term in Eq. 10.38) cancel one another, to first order. ! Problem 10.15. Obtain the fields for Ex. 10.2 directly from Jefimenko’s equations.11 10.3 Point Charges 10.3.1 Liénard–Wiechert Potentials My next project is to calculate the (retarded) potentials, V (r, t) and A(r, t), of a point charge q that is moving on a specified trajectory w(t) ≡ position of q at time t. (10.39) A naïve reading of the formula (Eq. 10.26) V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, tr) dτ′ (10.40) might suggest to you that the potential is simply 1 4πϵ0 q (the same as in the static case, with the understanding that is the distance to the retarded position of the charge). But this is wrong, for a very subtle 11 D. V. Red˘zi´c and V. Hnizdo, Eur. J. Phys. 34, 495 (2013). 457 10.3 Point Charges reason: it is true that for a point source the denominator comes outside the integral,12 but what remains, ∫ ρ(r′, tr) dτ′, (10.41) is not equal to the charge of the particle (and depends, through tr,onthe location of the point r). To calculate the total charge of a configuration, you must integrate ρ over the entire distribution at one instant of time, but here the retardation, tr = t − /c, obliges us to evaluate ρ at different times for different parts of the configuration. If the source is moving, the result will not be the total charge. You might think that this problem would disappear for point charges, but it doesn’t. In Maxwell’s electrodynamics, formulated as it is in terms of charge and current densities, a point charge must be regarded as the limit of an extended charge, when the size goes to zero. And for an extended particle, no matter how small, the retardation in Eq. 10.41 throws in a factor (1 − ˆ · v/c)−1,where v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time: ∫ ρ(r′, tr) dτ′ = q 1 − ˆ · v/c . (10.42) Proof. This is a purely geometrical effect, and it may help to tell the story in a less abstract context. You will not have noticed it, for obvious reasons, but the fact is that a train coming toward you looks a little longer than it really is, because the light you receive from the caboose left earlier than the light you receive (at the same instant) from the engine, and at that earlier time the train was farther away (Fig. 10.6). In the interval it takes light from the caboose to travel that longer distance L′, the train itself moves a distance L′ − L: L′ c = L′ − L v ,or L′ = L 1 − v/c . So approaching trains appear longer,byafactor (1 − v/c)−1.By contrast, a train going away from you looks shorter, 13 byafactor (1 + v/c)−1. In general, if the train’s velocity makes an angle θ with L v L Fig. 10.6 12 There is, however, an implicit change in its functional dependence: before the integration, = |r−r′ | is a function of r and r′; after the integration, which fixes r′ = w(tr), = |r−w(tr) | is (like tr) a function of r and t. 13 Please note that this has nothing whatever to do with special relativity or Lorentz contrac- tion – L is the length of the moving train, and its rest length is not at issue. The argument is somewhat reminiscent of the Doppler effect. 458 10 Potentials and Fields To observer L v L θ ˆ Fig. 10.7 your line of sight, 14 the extra distance light from the caboose must cover is L′ cos θ (Fig. 10.7). In the time L′ cos θ/c, then, the train moves a distance (L′ − L): L′ cos θ c = L′ − L v ,or L′ = L 1 − v cos θ/c . Notice that this effect does not distort the dimensions perpendic- ular to the motion (the height and width of the train). Never mind that the light from the far side is delayed in reaching you (relative to light from the near side) – since there’s no motion in that direction, they’ll still look the same distance apart. The apparent volume τ′ of the train, then, is related to the actual volume τ by τ′ = τ 1 − ˆ · v/c , (10.43) where ˆ is a unit vector from the train to the observer. In case the connection between moving trains and retarded potentials eludes you, the point is this: whenever you do an integral of the type in Eq. 10.41, in which the integrand is evaluated at the retarded time, the effective volume is not the same as the actual volume; rather, it is the latter modified by the factor in Eq. 10.43, just as the apparent volume of the train was. Because this correction factor makes no reference to the size of the particle, it is every bit as significant for a point charge as for an extended charge. □ Meanwhile, for a point charge the retarded time is determined implicitly by the equation |r − w(tr)| = c(t − tr). (10.44) The left-hand side is the distance the “news” must travel, and (t − tr) is the time it takes to make the trip (Fig. 10.8); is the vector from the retarded position to the field point r: = r − w(tr). (10.45) 14 I assume the train is far enough away or (more to the point) short enough so that rays from the caboose and engine can be considered parallel. 459 10.3 Point Charges y z x r w(tr) q Particle trajectory Retarded position Present position Fig. 10.8 It is important to note that at most one point on the trajectory is “in communication” with r at any particular time t. For suppose there were two such points, with retarded times t1 and t2: 1 = c(t − t1) and 2 = c(t − t2). Then 1 − 2 = c(t2 −t1), so the average speed of the particle in the direction of the point r would have to be c – and that’s not counting whatever velocity the charge might have in other directions. Since no charged particle can travel at the speed of light, it follows that only one retarded point contributes to the potentials, at any given moment. 15 It follows, then, that V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 qc ( c − · v) , (10.46) where v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, and is the vector from the retarded position to the field point r. Moreover, since the current density is ρv (Eq. 5.26), the vector potential is A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ ρ(r′, tr)v(tr) dτ′ = μ0 4π v ∫ ρ(r′, tr) dτ′, or A(r, t) = μ0 4π qcv ( c − · v) = v c2 V (r, t). (10.47) Equations 10.46 and 10.47 are the famous Liénard–Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.16 15 For the same reason, an observer at r sees the particle in only one place at a time. By contrast, it is possible to hear an object in two places at once. Consider a bear who growls at you and then runs toward you at the speed of sound and growls again; you hear both growls at the same time, coming from two different locations, but there’s only one bear. 16 There are many ways to obtain the Liénard–Wiechert potentials. I have tried to emphasize the geometrical origin of the factor (1−ˆ ·v/c)−1; for illuminating commentary, see W. K. H. Panofsky and M. Phillips, Classical Electricity and Magnetism, 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 460 10 Potentials and Fields Example 10.3. Find the potentials of a point charge moving with constant velocity. Solution. For convenience, let’s say the particle passes through the origin at time t = 0, so that w(t) = vt. We first compute the retarded time, using Eq. 10.44: |r − vtr| = c(t − tr), or, squaring: r 2 − 2r · vtr + v2t2 r = c2(t2 − 2ttr + t2 r ). Solving for tr by the quadratic formula, we find that tr = (c2t − r · v) ± √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r2 − c2t2) c2 − v2 . (10.48) To fix the sign, consider the limit v = 0: tr = t ± r c . In this case the charge is at rest at the origin, and the retarded time should be (t − r/c); evidently we want the minus sign. Now, from Eqs. 10.44 and 10.45, = c(t − tr) and ˆ = r − vtr c(t − tr) , so (1 − ˆ · v/c) = c(t − tr) [1 − v c · (r − vtr) c(t − tr) ] = c(t − tr) − v · r c + v2 c tr = 1 c [(c2t − r · v) − (c2 − v2)tr] = 1 c √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r2 − c2t2) (I used Eq. 10.48, with the minus sign, in the last step). Therefore, V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 qc √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r2 − c2t2) , (10.49) and (Eq. 10.47) A(r, t) = μ0 4π qcv √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r2 − c2t2) . (10.50) Reading, MA (1962), pp. 342–343. A more rigorous derivation is provided by J. R. Reitz, F. J. Milford, and R. W. Christy, Foundations of Electromagnetic Theory, 3rd ed., Addison- Wesley, Reading, MA (1979), Sect. 21.1, or M. A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3rd ed., Saunders, Orlando, FL (1995), Sect. 8.3. 461 10.3 Point Charges Problem 10.16. A particle of charge q moves in a circle of radius a at constant angular velocity ω. (Assume that the circle lies in the xy plane, centered at the origin, and at time t = 0 the charge is at (a,0), on the positive x-axis.) Find the Liénard–Wiechert potentials for points on the z-axis. • Problem 10.17. Show that the scalar potential of a point charge moving with constant velocity (Eq. 10.49) can be written more simply as V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 q R√ 1 − v2 sin2 θ/c2 , (10.51) where R ≡ r − vt is the vector from the present(!) position of the particle to the field point r,and θ is the angle between R and v (Fig. 10.9). Note that for nonrelativistic velocities (v2 ≪ c2), V (r, t) ≈ 1 4πϵ0 q R . q R v θ Fig. 10.9 Problem 10.18. I showed that at most one point on the particle trajectory communicates with r at any given time. In some cases there may be no such point (an observer at r would not see the particle – in the colorful language of general relativity, it is “over the horizon”). As an example, consider a particle in hyperbolic motion along the x-axis: w(t) = √ b2 + (ct)2ˆx (−∞ < t < ∞). (10.52) (In special relativity, this is the trajectory of a particle subject to a constant force F = mc2/b.) Sketch the graph of w versus t. At four or five representative points on the curve, draw the trajectory of a light signal emitted by the particle at that point – both in the plus x direction andinthe minus x direction. What region on your graph corresponds to points and times (x, t) from which the particle cannot be seen? At what time does someone at point x first see the particle? (Prior to this the potential at x is zero.) Is it possible for a particle, once seen, to disappear from view? ! Problem 10.19. Determine the Liénard–Wiechert potentials for a charge in hyperbolic motion (Eq. 10.52). Assume the point r is on the x-axisand to theright of thecharge(x > w(tr)).17 17 The fields of a point charge in hyperbolic motion are notoriously tricky. Indeed, a straightforward application of the Liénard–Wiechert potentials yields an electric field in violation of Gauss’s law. This paradox was resolved by Bondi and Gold in 1955. For a history of the problem, see E. Eriksen and Ø. Grøn, Ann. Phys. 286, 320 (2000). 462 10 Potentials and Fields 10.3.2 The Fields of a Moving Point Charge We are now in a position to calculate the electric and magnetic fields of a point charge in arbitrary motion, using the Liénard–Wiechert potentials: 18 V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 qc ( c − · v) , A(r, t) = v c2 V (r, t), (10.53) and the equations for E and B: E = −∇V − ∂A ∂t , B = ∇ × A. The differentiation is tricky, however, because = r − w(tr) and v = ˙w(tr) (10.54) are both evaluated at the retarded time, and tr – defined implicitly by the equation |r − w(tr)| = c(t − tr) (10.55) –is itself a function of r and t. 19 So hang on: the next two pages are rough going … but the answer is worth the effort. Let’s begin with the gradient of V : ∇V = qc 4πϵ0 −1 ( c − · v)2 ∇( c − · v). (10.56) Since = c(t − tr),20 ∇ = −c∇tr. (10.57) As for the second term, product rule 4 gives ∇( · v) = ( · ∇)v + (v · ∇) + × (∇ × v) + v × (∇ × ). (10.58) Evaluating these terms one at a time, ( · ∇)v = ( x ∂ ∂x + y ∂ ∂y + z ∂ ∂z )v(tr) = x dv dtr ∂tr ∂x + y dv dtr ∂tr ∂y + z dv dtr ∂tr ∂z = a( · ∇tr), (10.59) where a ≡ ˙v is the acceleration of the particle at the retarded time. Now (v · ∇) = (v · ∇)r − (v · ∇)w, (10.60) 18 You can get the fields directly from Jefimenko’s equations, but it’s not easy. See, for example, M. A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3rd ed., Saunders, Orlando, FL (1995), Sect. 8.4. 19 The following calculation is done by the most direct, “brute-force” method. For a more clever and efficient approach, see J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., John Wiley, New York (1999), Sect. 14.1. 20 Remember that = r − w(tr) (Fig. 10.8), and tr is itself a function of r. Contrast Prob. 1.13 (and Section 10.2), where = r − r′ (Fig. 10.3), and r′ was an independent variable. In that case ∇ = ˆ, but here we have a more complicated problem on our hands. 463 10.3 Point Charges and (v · ∇)r = (vx ∂ ∂x + vy ∂ ∂y + vz ∂ ∂z ) (xˆx + yˆy + zˆz) = vxˆx + vyˆy + vzˆz = v, (10.61) while (v · ∇)w = v(v · ∇tr) (same reasoning as Eq. 10.59). Moving on to the third term in Eq. 10.58, ∇ × v = ( ∂vz ∂y − ∂vy ∂z ) ˆx + ( ∂vx ∂z − ∂vz ∂x )ˆy + ( ∂vy ∂x − ∂vx ∂y )ˆz = ( dvz dtr ∂tr ∂y − dvy dtr ∂tr ∂z ) ˆx + ( dvx dtr ∂tr ∂z − dvz dtr ∂tr ∂x )ˆy + ( dvy dtr ∂tr ∂x − dvx dtr ∂tr ∂y )ˆz = −a × ∇tr. (10.62) Finally, ∇ × = ∇ × r − ∇ × w, (10.63) but ∇ × r = 0, while, by the same argument as Eq. 10.62, ∇ × w = −v × ∇tr. (10.64) Putting all this back into Eq. 10.58, and using the “BAC–CAB” rule to reduce the triple cross products, ∇( · v) = a( · ∇tr) + v − v(v · ∇tr) − × (a × ∇tr) + v × (v × ∇tr) = v + ( · a − v2)∇tr. (10.65) Collecting Eqs. 10.57 and 10.65,wehave ∇V = qc 4πϵ0 1 ( c − · v)2 [v + (c2 − v2 + · a)∇tr]. (10.66) To complete the calculation, we need to know ∇tr. This can be found by taking the gradient of the defining equation (Eq. 10.55) – which we have already done in Eq. 10.57 – and expanding ∇ : −c∇tr = ∇ = ∇√ · = 1 2 √ · ∇( · ) = 1 [( · ∇) + × (∇ × )]. (10.67) But ( · ∇) = − v( · ∇tr) (same idea as Eq. 10.60), while (from Eqs. 10.63 and 10.64) ∇ × = (v × ∇tr). 464 10 Potentials and Fields Thus −c∇tr = 1 [ − v( · ∇tr) + × (v × ∇tr)] = 1 [ − ( · v)∇tr], and hence ∇tr = − c − · v . (10.68) Incorporating this result into Eq. 10.66, I conclude that ∇V = 1 4πϵ0 qc ( c − · v)3 [( c − · v)v − (c2 − v2 + · a) ]. (10.69) A similar calculation, which I shall leave for you (Prob. 10.20), yields ∂A ∂t = 1 4πϵ0 qc ( c − · v)3 [( c − · v)(−v + a/c) + c (c2 − v2 + · a)v]. (10.70) Combining these results, and introducing the vector u ≡ cˆ − v, (10.71) I find E(r, t) = q 4πϵ0 ( · u)3 [(c2 − v2)u + × (u × a)]. (10.72) Meanwhile, ∇ × A = 1 c2 ∇ × (V v) = 1 c2 [V (∇ × v) − v × (∇V )]. We have already calculated ∇ × v (Eq. 10.62)and ∇V (Eq. 10.69). Putting these together, ∇ × A = − 1 c q 4πϵ0 1 (u · )3 × [(c2 − v2)v + ( · a)v + ( · u)a]. The quantity in brackets is strikingly similar to the one in Eq. 10.72, which can be written, using the BAC–CAB rule, as [(c 2 − v2)u + ( · a)u − ( · u)a]; the main difference is that we have v’s instead of u’s in the first two terms. In fact, since it’s all crossed into anyway, we can with impunity change these v’s into −u’s; the extra term proportional to disappears in the cross product. It follows that B(r, t) = 1 c ˆ × E(r, t). (10.73) Evidently, the magnetic field of a point charge is always perpendicular to the electric field, and to the vector from the retarded point. The first term in E (the one involving (c 2 − v2)u) falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the particle. If the velocity and acceleration are both zero, this term alone survives and reduces to the old electrostatic result E = 1 4πϵ0 q 2 ˆ. 465 10.3 Point Charges For this reason, the first term in E is sometimes called the generalized Coulomb field. (Because it does not depend on the acceleration, it is also known as the velocity field.) The second term (the one involving × (u × a)) falls off as the inverse first power of and is therefore dominant at large distances. As we shall see in Chapter 11, it is this term that is responsible for electromagnetic radiation; accordingly, it is called the radiation field – or, since it is proportional to a,the acceleration field. The same terminology applies to the magnetic field. Back in Chapter 2, I remarked that if we could write down the formula for the force that one point charge exerts on another, we would be done with electrodynamics, in principle. That, together with the superposition princi- ple, would tell us the force exerted on a test charge Q by any configuration whatsoever. Well, here we are: Eqs. 10.72 and 10.73 give us the fields, and the Lorentz force law determines the resulting force: F = qQ 4πϵ0 ( · u)3 {[(c2 − v2)u + × (u × a)] + V c × [ˆ × [(c2 − v2)u + × (u × a)]]}, (10.74) where V is the velocity of Q,and , u, v,and a are all evaluated at the retarded time. The entire theory of classical electrodynamics is contained in that equation … but you see why I preferred to start out with Coulomb’s law. Example 10.4. Calculate the electric and magnetic fields of a point charge moving with constant velocity. Solution. Putting a = 0 in Eq. 10.72, E = q 4πϵ0 (c2 − v2) ( · u)3 u. In this case, using w = vt, u = c − v = c(r − vtr) − c(t − tr)v = c(r − vt). In Ex. 10.3 we found that c − · v = · u = √(c2t − r · v)2 + (c2 − v2)(r2 − c2t2). In Prob. 10.17 you showed that this radical could be written as Rc√ 1 − v2 sin2 θ/c2, where R ≡ r − vt is the vector from the present location of the particle to r,and θ is the angle between R and v (Fig. 10.9). Thus E(r, t) = q 4πϵ0 1 − v2/c2 (1 − v2 sin2 θ/c2)3/2 ˆR R2 . (10.75) 466 10 Potentials and Fields E v Fig. 10.10 Notice that E points along the line from the present position of the par- ticle. This is an extraordinary coincidence, since the “message” came from the retarded position. Because of the sin2 θ in the denominator, the field of a fast-moving charge is flattened out like a pancake in the direction perpendicular to the motion (Fig. 10.10). In the forward and backward directions E is reduced byafactor (1 − v 2/c2) relative to the field of a charge at rest; in the perpendicular direction it is enhanced by a factor 1/ √1 − v2/c2. As for B,wehave ˆ = r − vtr = (r − vt) + (t − tr)v = R + v c , and therefore B = 1 c (ˆ × E) = 1 c2 (v × E). (10.76) Lines of B circle around the charge, as shown in Fig. 10.11. The fields of a point charge moving at constant velocity (Eqs. 10.75 and 10.76) were first obtained by Oliver Heaviside in 1888. 21 When v2 ≪ c2 they reduce to E(r, t) ≈ 1 4πϵ0 q R2 ˆR, B(r, t) ≈ μ0 4π q R2 (v × ˆR). (10.77) The first is essentially Coulomb’s law, and the second is the “Biot– Savart law for a point charge” I warned you about in Chapter 5 (Eq. 5.43). B v Fig. 10.11 21 For history and references, see O. J. Jefimenko, Am.J.Phys. 62, 79 (1994). 467 10.3 Point Charges Example 10.5. (The Thomson kink model) A point charge is at rest at the origin when, at time t = 0, it is given a kick in the x direction, and flies off at constant speed v. Sketch the electric field at some later time. How about the magnetic field? E x y r1 r2 Fig. 10.12 Solution. Let’s say the “kick” lasts a short time τ (starting at t = 0), during which the particle accelerates up to speed v. Outside a sphere of radius r2 = ct, “news” of the kick has not yet arrived, and the field is that of a particle at rest at the origin (Fig. 10.12). Inside a sphere of radius r1 = c(t − τ),22 the news has arrived, and E is the “flattened” field of a particle moving at constant velocity (Fig. 10.10). Within the shell between these spheres we don’t know precisely what the field looks like (because we haven’t been told exactly how the charge accelerates during the kick); but this much we do know: the field lines must join up. Within the shell (which, by the way, is expanding at the speed of light) the electric field has a “kink,” and in particular it acquires a significant tangential component. Meanwhile, the magnetic field is zero outside the outer sphere, and circles around the x-axis inside the inner sphere (Fig. 10.11). It is everywhere perpendicular to E (Eq. 10.73). Within the expanding shell the Poynting vector has a substantial radial component: energy is “radiating” away from the charge at the speed of light.23 Problem 10.20. Derive Eq. 10.70. First show that ∂tr ∂t = c · u . (10.78) 22 The inner sphere is centered at the location of the charge at time t = τ. 23 This lovely qualitative model for the electromagnetic radiation from an accelerating charge is due originally to J. J. Thomson, Electricity and Matter, Yale University Press, New Haven, CT (1904), p. 55. See also E. M. Purcell and D. J. Morin, Electricity and Magnetism,3rd ed., Cambridge University Press (2013), Sect. 5.7 and App. H; R. Y Tsien, Am.J.Phys. 40, 46 (1972); H. C. Ohanian, Am.J.Phys. 48, 170 (1980). 468 10 Potentials and Fields Problem 10.21. (a) Suppose a point charge q is constrained to move along the x-axis. Show that the fields at points on the axis to the right ofthechargearegivenby E = q 4πϵ0 1 2 ( c + v c − v ) ˆx, B = 0. (Do not assume v is constant!) What are the fields on the axis to the left of the charge? (b) In Ex. 10.4 Inotedthat E is reduced in the forward and backward directions by a factor of (1 − (v/c)2), in the case of constant velocity. This might appear to contradict your result in (a). Resolve this “paradox.” Problem 10.22. For a point charge moving at constant velocity, calculate the flux integral ∮ E · da (using Eq. 10.75), over the surface of a sphere centered at the present location of the charge.24 Problem 10.23. (a) Use Eq. 10.75 to calculate the electric field a distance d from an infinite straight wire carrying a uniform line charge λ, moving at a constant speed v down the wire. (b) Use Eq. 10.76 to find the magnetic field of this wire. Problem 10.24. For the configuration in Prob. 10.16, find the electric and magnetic fields at the center. From your formula for B, determine the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop carrying a steady current I, and compare your answer with the result of Ex. 5.6. More Problems on Chapter 10 Problem 10.25. Suppose you take a plastic ring of radius a andgluechargeonit, sothat the line charge density is λ0|sin(θ/2)|. Then you spin the loop about its axis at an angular velocity ω. Find the (exact) scalar and vector potentials at the center of the ring. [Answer: A = (μ0λ0ωa/3π){sin[ω(t − a/c)]ˆx − cos[ω(t − a/c)]ˆy}.] Problem 10.26. Figure 2.35 summarizes the laws of electrostatics in a “triangle diagram” relating the source (ρ), the field (E), and the potential (V). Figure 5.51 doesthesameformag- netostatics, where the source is J, the field is B, and the potential is A. Construct the analogous diagram for electrodynamics, with sources ρ and J (constrained by the continuity equation), fields E and B, and potentials V and A (constrained by the Lorenz gauge condition). Do not include formulas for V and A in terms of E and B. 24 Wheeler’s First Moral Principle says “Never make a calculation until you know the answer” (E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics, Freeman (1966), p. 60). It doesn’t always work, but this is a good problem to try it on. 469 More Problems on Chapter 10 Problem 10.27.

Problem 10.36. In Section 10.2.1 I noted that the naïve “derivation”of the retarded potentials fails for the fields. The reason is subtle, but it can be fixed.27 In the Lorenz gauge the potentials satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16): □ 2f (r, t) = −s(r, t), (10.80) where f stands for V or A,and s for the corresponding source (ρ/ϵ0 or μ0J). The solution (for localized sources) is f (r, t) = 1 4π ∫ s(r′, tr) dτ′ (10.81) (Eq. 10.26), as we guessed, and then confirmed.

Imagine an ideal electric dipole at the origin, pointing in the z direction, whose dipole moment is increasing linearly with time: p(t) = ktˆz (10.83) (for some constant k). Evidently, there is a steady current flowing from the negative end to the positive end: J(r) = αδ3(r)ˆz, (10.84) where α is a constant to be determined. (a) From the continuity equation, find the charge density ρ(r, t). Stipulate that there is no static background charge: ρ(r,0) = 0. [Express your answer as a derivative of the delta function.] (b) From the charge density, calculate the electric dipole moment, and, comparing Eq. 10.83, determine α (in terms of k). [Hint: Use integration by parts.] (c) When ρ(r, t) is linear in t,and J(r) is constant, a lucky cancelation means that the electric field satisfies Coulomb’s law, and the magnetic field satisfies the Biot–Savart law, with no retardation (see Probs. 10.13 and 10.14). In our case, then, E(r, t) is given by the electrostatic formula (Eq. 3.106), with p the present dipole moment (Eq. 10.83). What is the magnetic field, B(r, t)? (d) Now suppose there is a second such dipole, located on the z-axis at z = a and pointing in the x direction. What is the net force of p1 on p2,and of p2 on p1? Is Newton’s third law obeyed? (e) Now the hard part: calculate the field momentum (Eq. 8.29) associated with their interaction, pem(t) = ϵ0 ∫ [(E1 × B2) + (E2 × B1)] dτ, (10.85) and show that its rate of change exactly balances the net force on the two dipoles, so the total momentum is conserved.28 [Use a computer to help with the integrals.] 28 This is a simplified version of O. Narayan, Am. J. Phys. 89, 1033 (2021), due to V. Onoochin. (The self-forces and self-field momenta are all zero.) 11 Radiation 11.1 Dipole Radiation 11.1.1 What Is Radiation? When charges accelerate, their fields can transport energy irreversibly out to infinity – a process we call radiation. 1 Let us assume the source is localized 2 near the origin; we would like to calculate the energy it radiates at time t0. Imagine a gigantic sphere, out at radius r (Fig. 11.1). The power passing through its surface is the integral of the Poynting vector: P(r, t) = ∮ S · da = 1 μ0 ∮ (E × B) · da. (11.1) Because electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light, 3 this energy actually left the source at the earlier time t0 = t − r/c, so the power radiated is Prad(t0) = lim r→∞ P(r, t0 + r c ) (11.2) (with t0 held constant). This is energy (per unit time) that is carried away and never comes back. Now, the area of the sphere is 4πr 2, so for radiation to occur the Poynting vector must decrease (at large r)nofasterthan1/r 2 (if it went like 1/r 3,for example, then P would go like 1/r,and Prad would be zero). According to Coulomb’s law, electrostatic fields fall off like 1/r 2 (or even faster, if the total charge is zero), and the Biot–Savart law says that magnetostatic fields go like 1/r 2 (or faster), which means that S ∼ 1/r 4, for static configurations. So static sources do not radiate. But Jefimenko’s equations (Eqs. 10.36 and 10.38) indicate that time-dependent fields include terms (involving ˙ρ and ˙J) that go like 1/r; these are the terms that are responsible for electromagnetic radiation. 1 In this chapter, the word “radiation” is used in a restricted technical sense – it might better be called “radiation to infinity.” In everyday language the word has a broader connotation. We speak, for example, of radiation from a heat lamp or an X-ray machine. In this more general sense, electromagnetic “radiation” applies to any fields that transport energy – which is to say, fields whose Poynting vector is nonzero. There is nothing wrong with that language, but it is not how I am using the term here. 2 For nonlocalized configurations, such as infinite planes, wires, or solenoids, the concept of “radiation” must be reformulated (Prob. 11.28). 3 More precisely, the fields depend on the status of the source at the retarded time. 473 11.1 Dipole Radiation r Source Fig. 11.1 The study of radiation, then, involves picking out the parts of E and B that go like 1/r at large distances from the source, constructing from them the 1/r 2 term in S, integrating over a large spherical4 surface, and taking the limit as r →∞. I’ll carry through this procedure first for oscillating electric and magnetic dipoles; then, in Section 11.2, we’ll consider the more difficult case of radiation from an accelerating point charge. 11.1.2 Electric Dipole Radiation Picture two tiny metal spheres separated by a distance d and connected by a fine wire (Fig. 11.2); at time t the charge on the upper sphere is q(t),and the charge on the lower sphere is −q(t). Suppose that we drive the charge back and forth through the wire, from one end to the other, at an angular frequency ω: q(t) = q0 cos(ωt). (11.3) The result is an oscillating electric dipole:5 p(t) = p0 cos(ωt)ˆz, (11.4) where p0 ≡ q0d is the maximum value of the dipole moment. The retarded potential (Eq. 10.26)is V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 { q0 cos[ω(t − +/c)] + − q0 cos[ω(t − −/c)] − }, (11.5) where, by the law of cosines, ± = √ r2 ∓ rd cos θ + (d/2)2. (11.6) 4 It doesn’t have to be a sphere, of course, but this makes the calculations a lot easier. 5 It might occur to you that a more natural model would consist of equal and opposite charges mounted on a spring, say, so that q is constant while d oscillates, instead of the other way around. Such a model would lead to the same result, but moving point charges are hard to work with, and the proposed formulation is much simpler. 474 11 Radiation z y d \u0004 \u0002 r θ \u0004q \u0002q Fig. 11.2 Now, to make this physical dipole into a perfect dipole, we want the separation distance to be extremely small: approximation 1: d ≪ r. (11.7) Of course, if d is zero we get no potential at all; what we want is an expansion carried to first order in d. Thus ± ≈ r(1 ∓ d 2r cos θ). (11.8) It follows that 1 ± ≈ 1 r (1 ± d 2r cos θ), (11.9) and cos[ω(t − ±/c)] ≈ cos[ω(t − r/c) ± ωd 2c cos θ] = cos[ω(t − r/c)]cos( ωd 2c cos θ) ∓ sin[ω(t − r/c)]sin( ωd 2c cos θ). In the perfect dipole limit we have, further, approximation 2: d ≪ c ω . (11.10) (Since waves of frequency ω have a wavelength λ = 2πc/ω, this amounts to the requirement d ≪ λ.) Under these conditions, cos[ω(t − ±/c)] ≈ cos[ω(t − r/c)] ∓ ωd 2c cos θ sin[ω(t − r/c)]. (11.11) Putting Eqs. 11.9 and 11.11 into Eq. 11.5, we obtain the potential of an oscillating perfect dipole: V (r, θ, t) = p0 cos θ 4πϵ0r {− ω c sin[ω(t − r/c)] + 1 r cos[ω(t − r/c)]}. (11.12) 475 11.1 Dipole Radiation z dz y r θ \u0004q \u0002q Fig. 11.3 In the static limit (ω → 0) the second term reproduces the old formula for the potential of a stationary dipole (Eq. 3.102): V = p0 cos θ 4πϵ0r2 . This is not, however, the term that concerns us now; we are interested in the fields that survive at large distances from the source, in the so-called radiation zone: 6 approximation 3: r ≫ c ω (11.13) (or, in terms of the wavelength, r ≫ λ). In this region the potential reduces to7 V (r, θ, t) = − p0ω 4πϵ0c ( cos θ r ) sin[ω(t − r/c)]. (11.14) Meanwhile, the vector potential is determined by the current flowing in the wire: I(t) = dq dt ˆz = −q0ω sin(ωt)ˆz. (11.15) Referring to Fig. 11.3 (and Eq. 10.26), A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ d/2 −d/2 −q0ω sin[ω(t − /c)]ˆz dz. (11.16) Because the integration itself introduces a factor of d,wecan,tofirst order, replace the integrand by its value at the center: A(r, θ, t) = − μ0p0ω 4πr sin[ω(t − r/c)]ˆz. (11.17) 6 Note that approximations 2 and 3 subsume approximation 1; all together, we have d ≪ λ ≪ r. 7 I am dropping the fastidious ≈ in favor of =; it’s not the exact potential, but it is the relevant part of that potential, if you’re talking about radiation. 476 11 Radiation (Notice that whereas I implicitly used approximations 1 and 2, in keeping only the first order in d, Eq. 11.17 is not subject to approximation 3.) From the potentials, it is a straightforward matter to compute the fields: ∇V = ∂V ∂r ˆr + 1 r ∂V ∂θ ˆθ = − p0ω 4πϵ0c { cos θ (− 1 r2 sin[ω(t − r/c)] − ω rc cos[ω(t − r/c)])ˆr − sin θ r2 sin[ω(t − r/c)] ˆθ} ≈ p0ω2 4πϵ0c2 ( cos θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)]ˆr. (I dropped the first and last terms, in accordance with approximation 3.) Likewise, ∂A ∂t = − μ0p0ω2 4πr cos[ω(t − r/c)](cos θ ˆr − sin θ ˆθ), and therefore E = −∇V − ∂A ∂t = − μ0p0ω2 4π ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆθ. (11.18) Meanwhile, ∇ × A = 1 r [ ∂ ∂r (rAθ) − ∂Ar ∂θ ] ˆφ = − μ0p0ω 4πr { ω c sin θ cos[ω(t − r/c)] + sin θ r sin[ω(t − r/c)]} ˆφ. The second term is again eliminated by approximation 3, so B = ∇ × A = − μ0p0ω2 4πc ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆφ. (11.19) Equations 11.18 and 11.19 represent monochromatic waves of frequency ω traveling in the radial direction at the speed of light. The fields are in phase, mutually perpendicular, and transverse; the ratio of their amplitudes is E0/B0 = c. All of this is precisely what we expect for electromagnetic waves in free space. (These are actually spherical waves, not plane waves, and their amplitude decreases like 1/r as they progress. But for large r,theyare approximately plane over small regions – just as the surface of the Earth is reasonably flat, locally.) The energy radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is determined by the Poynting vector: S(r, t) = 1 μ0 (E × B) = μ0 c { p0ω2 4π ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)]}2 ˆr. (11.20) 477 11.1 Dipole Radiation Fig. 11.4 The intensity is obtained by averaging (in time) over a complete cycle: ⟨S⟩ = ( μ0p 2 0ω4 32π2c ) sin2 θ r2 ˆr. (11.21) Notice that there is no radiation along the axis of the dipole (here sin θ = 0); the intensity profile 8 takes the form of a donut, with its maximum in the equatorial plane (Fig. 11.4). The total power radiated is found by integrating ⟨S⟩ over a sphere of radius r: ⟨P⟩ = ∫ ⟨S⟩· da = μ0p 2 0ω4 32π2c ∫ sin2 θ r2 r 2 sin θ dθ dφ = μ0p 2 0ω4 12πc . (11.22) Example 11.1. The strong frequency dependence of the power formula is what accounts for the blueness of the sky. Sunlight passing through the atmosphere stimulates atoms to oscillate as tiny dipoles. The incident solar radiation covers a broad range of frequencies (white light), but the energy absorbed and reradiated by the atmospheric dipoles is stronger at the higher frequencies because of the ω4 in Eq. 11.22. It is more intense in the blue, then, than in the red. It is this reradiated light that you see when you look up in the sky – unless, of course, you’re staring directly at the Sun. Because electromagnetic waves are transverse, the dipoles oscillate in a plane orthogonal to the Sun’s rays. In the celestial arc perpendic- ular to these rays, where the blueness is most pronounced, the dipoles oscillating along the line of sight send no radiation to the observer (because of the sin2 θ in Eq. 11.21); light received at this angle is therefore polarized perpendicular to the Sun’s rays (Fig. 11.5). The redness of sunset is the other side of the same coin: Sunlight coming in along a tangent to the Earth’s surface must pass through a much longer stretch of atmosphere than sunlight coming from overhead (Fig. 11.6). Accordingly, much of the blue has been removed by scattering, and what’s left is red. 8 The radial coordinate in Fig. 11.4 represents the magnitude of ⟨S⟩ in that direction. 478 11 Radiation Sun’s rays This dipole radiates to the observer This dipole does not radiate to the observer Fig. 11.5 Atmosphere (thickness grossly exaggerated) Sun's rays Fig. 11.6 Problem 11.1. Check that the retarded potentials of an oscillating dipole (Eqs. 11.12 and 11.17) satisfy the Lorenz gauge condition. Do not use approximation 3. Problem 11.2. Equation 11.14 can be expressed in “coordinate-free” form by writing p0 cos θ = p0 · ˆr. Do so, and likewise for Eqs. 11.17, 11.18, 11.19,and 11.21. Problem 11.3. Find the radiation resistance of the wire joining the two ends of the dipole. (This is the resistance that would give the same average power loss – to heat – as the oscillating dipole in fact puts out in the form of radiation.) Show that R = 790 (d/λ)2Ω,where λ is the wavelength of the radiation. For the wires in an ordinary radio (say, d = 5 cm), should you worry about the radiative contribution to the total resistance? ! Problem 11.4. A rotating electric dipole can be thought of as the superposition of two oscillat- ing dipoles, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis (Fig. 11.7), with the latter out of phase by 90◦: p = p0[cos(ωt)ˆx + sin(ωt)ˆy]. Using the principle of superposition and Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19 (perhaps in the form suggested by Prob. 11.2), find the fields of a rotating dipole. Also find the Poynting vector and the intensity of the radiation. Sketch the intensity profile as a function of the polar angle θ, and calculate the total power radiated. Does the answer seem reasonable? (Note that power, being quadratic in 479 11.1 Dipole Radiation the fields, does not satisfy the superposition principle. In this instance, however, it seems to. How do you account for this? You might want to refer to the “caution”at the end of Section 8.2.4.) y x wt \u0004q \u0002q p Fig. 11.7 11.1.3 Magnetic Dipole Radiation Suppose now that we have a wire loop of radius b (Fig. 11.8), around which we drive an alternating current: I (t) = I0 cos(ωt). (11.23) This is a model for an oscillating magnetic dipole, m(t) = πb 2I (t)ˆz = m0 cos(ωt)ˆz, (11.24) where m0 ≡ πb 2I0 (11.25) is the maximum value of the magnetic dipole moment. The loop is uncharged, so the scalar potential is zero. The retarded vector potential is A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ I0 cos[ω(t − /c)] dl′. (11.26) For a point r directly above the x-axis (Fig. 11.8), A must aiminthe y direction, since the x components from symmetrically placed points on either side of the x-axis will cancel. Thus A(r, t) = μ0I0b 4π ˆy ∫ 2π 0 cos[ω(t − /c)] cos φ′ dφ′ (11.27) (cos φ′ serves to pick out the y-component of dl′). By the law of cosines, = √ r2 + b2 − 2rb cos ψ, where ψ is the angle between the vectors r and b: r = r sin θ ˆx + r cos θ ˆz, b = b cos φ′ˆx + b sin φ′ˆy. So rb cos ψ = r · b = rb sin θ cos φ′, and therefore = √ r2 + b2 − 2rb sin θ cos φ′. (11.28) 480 11 Radiation y z b r dl′x φ′ ψ θ Fig. 11.8 For a “perfect” dipole, we want the loop to be extremely small: approximation 1: b ≪ r. (11.29) To first order in b, then, ≈ r(1 − b r sin θ cos φ′), so 1 ≈ 1 r (1 + b r sin θ cos φ′) (11.30) and cos[ω(t − /c)] ≈ cos[ω(t − r/c) + ωb c sin θ cos φ′] = cos[ω(t − r/c)]cos( ωb c sin θ cos φ′) − sin[ω(t − r/c)]sin( ωb c sin θ cos φ′). As before, we also assume the size of the dipole is small compared to the wavelength of the radiation: approximation 2: b ≪ c ω . (11.31) In that case, cos[ω(t − /c)] ≈ cos[ω(t − r/c)] − ωb c sin θ cos φ′ sin[ω(t − r/c)]. (11.32) Inserting Eqs. 11.30 and 11.32 into Eq. 11.27, and dropping the second- order term, A(r, t) ≈ μ0I0b 4πr ˆy ∫ 2π 0 { cos[ω(t − r/c)] + b sin θ cos φ′ × ( 1 r cos[ω(t − r/c)] − ω c sin[ω(t − r/c)]) } cos φ′ dφ′. The first term integrates to zero: ∫ 2π 0 cos φ′ dφ′ = 0. 481 11.1 Dipole Radiation The second term involves the integral of cosine squared: ∫ 2π 0 cos2 φ′ dφ′ = π. Putting this in, and noting that in general A points in the ˆφ direction, I conclude that the vector potential of an oscillating perfect magnetic dipole is A(r, θ, t) = μ0m0 4π ( sin θ r ) { 1 r cos[ω(t − r/c)] − ω c sin[ω(t − r/c)]} ˆφ. (11.33) In the static limit (ω = 0) we recover the familiar formula for the potential of a magnetic dipole (Eq. 5.87) A(r, θ) = μ0 4π m0 sin θ r2 ˆφ. In the radiation zone, approximation 3: r ≫ c ω , (11.34) the first term in A is negligible, so A(r, θ, t) = − μ0m0ω 4πc ( sin θ r ) sin[ω(t − r/c)] ˆφ. (11.35) From A we obtain the fields at large r: E = − ∂A ∂t = μ0m0ω2 4πc ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆφ, (11.36) and B = ∇ × A = − μ0m0ω2 4πc2 ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)] ˆθ. (11.37) (I used approximation 3 in calculating B.) These fields are in phase, mutually perpendicular, and transverse to the direction of propagation (ˆr), and the ratio of their amplitudes is E0/B0 = c, all of which is as expected for electromagnetic waves. They are, in fact, remarkably similar in structure to the fields of an oscillating electric dipole (Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19), only this time it is B that points in the ˆθ direction and E in the ˆφ direction, whereas for electric dipoles it’s the other way around. The energy flux for magnetic dipole radiation is S(r, t) = 1 μ0 (E × B) = μ0 c { m0ω2 4πc ( sin θ r ) cos[ω(t − r/c)]}2 ˆr, (11.38) the intensity is ⟨S⟩ = ( μ0m 2 0ω4 32π2c3 ) sin2 θ r2 ˆr, (11.39) 482 11 Radiation and the total radiated power is ⟨P⟩ = μ0m 2 0ω4 12πc3 . (11.40) Once again, the intensity profile has the shape of a donut (Fig. 11.4), and the power radiated goes like ω4. There is, however, one important dif- ference between electric and magnetic dipole radiation: for configurations with comparable dimensions, the power radiated electrically is enormously greater. Comparing Eqs. 11.22 and 11.40, Pmagnetic Pelectric = ( m0 p0c ) 2, (11.41) where (remember) m0 = πb 2I0,and p0 = q0d. The amplitude of the current in the electrical case was I0 = q0ω (Eq. 11.15). Setting d = πb, for the sake of comparison, I get Pmagnetic Pelectric = ( ωb c ) 2. (11.42) But ωb/c is precisely the quantity we assumed was very small (approxima- tion 2), and here it appears squared. Ordinarily, then, one should expect electric dipole radiation to dominate. Only when the system is carefully contrived to exclude any electric contribution (as in the case just treated) will the magnetic dipole radiation reveal itself. Problem 11.5. Calculate the electric and magnetic fields of an oscillating magnetic dipole without using approximation 3. [Do they look familiar? Compare Prob. 9.37.] Find the Poynting vector, and show that the intensity of the radiation is exactly the same as we got using approximation 3. Problem 11.6. Find the radiation resistance (Prob. 11.3) for the oscillating magnetic dipole in Fig. 11.8. Express your answer in terms of λ and b, and compare the radiation resistance of the electric dipole. [Answer: 3 × 105(b/λ)4Ω.] Problem 11.7. Use the “duality” transformation Prob. 7.68, together with the fields of an oscillating electric dipole (Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19), to determine the fields that would be produced by an oscillating “Gilbert”magnetic dipole (composed of equal and opposite magnetic charges, instead of an electric current loop). Compare Eqs. 11.36 and 11.37, and comment on the result. 11.1.4 Radiation from an Arbitrary Source In the previous sections, we studied the radiation produced by two specific systems: oscillating electric dipoles and oscillating magnetic dipoles. Now I want to apply the same reasoning to a configuration of charge and current that is entirely arbitrary, except that it is localized within some finite volume near the origin (Fig. 11.9). The retarded scalar potential is 483 11.1 Dipole Radiation τ Fig. 11.9 V (r, t) = 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′, t − /c) dτ′, (11.43) where = √r2 + r′2 − 2r · r′. (11.44) As before, we shall assume that the field point r is far away, in comparison to the dimensions of the source: approximation 1: r′ ≪ r. (11.45) (Actually, r′ is a variable of integration; approximation 1 means that the maximum value of r′, as it ranges over the source, is much less than r.) On this assumption, ≈ r(1 − r · r′ r2 ), (11.46) so 1 ≈ 1 r (1 + r · r′ r2 ) (11.47) and ρ(r′, t − /c) ≈ ρ (r′, t − r c + ˆr · r′ c ). Expanding ρ as a Taylor series in t about the retarded time at the origin, t0 ≡ t − r c , (11.48) we have ρ(r′, t − /c) ≈ ρ(r′, t0) + ˙ρ(r′, t0) (ˆr · r′ c ) + ··· , (11.49) where the dot signifies differentiation with respect to time. The next terms in the series would be1 2 ¨ρ (ˆr · r′ c ) 2, 1 3! ... ρ (ˆr · r′ c ) 3, ... . We can afford to drop them, provided approximation 2: r′ ≪ c | ¨ρ/ ˙ρ| , c |... ρ / ˙ρ|1/2 , c |.... ρ / ˙ρ|1/3 , ... . (11.50) 484 11 Radiation For an oscillating system, each of these ratios is c/ω, and we recover the old approximation 2. In the general case it’s more difficult to interpret Eq. 11.50, but as a procedural matter approximations 1 and 2 amount to keeping only the first-order terms in r′. Putting Eqs. 11.47 and 11.49 into the formula for V (Eq. 11.43), and again discarding the second-order term, V (r, t) ≈ 1 4πϵ0r [∫ ρ(r′, t0) dτ′+ˆr r · ∫ r′ρ(r′, t0) dτ′+ˆr c · d dt ∫ r′ρ(r′, t0) dτ′]. The first integral is simply the total charge, Q, at time t0. Because charge is conserved, Q is independent of time. The other two integrals represent the electric dipole moment at time t0. Thus V (r, t) ≈ 1 4πϵ0 [ Q r + ˆr · p(t0) r2 + ˆr · ˙p(t0) rc ]. (11.51) In the static case, the first two terms are the monopole and dipole contri- butions to the multipole expansion for V ; the third term, of course, would not be present. Meanwhile, the vector potential is A(r, t) = μ0 4π ∫ J(r′, t − /c) dτ′. (11.52) As you’ll see in a moment, to first order in r′ it suffices to replace by r in the integrand: A(r, t) ≈ μ0 4πr ∫ J(r′, t0) dτ′. (11.53) According to Prob. 5.7, the integral of J is the time derivative of the dipole moment, so A(r, t) ≈ μ0 4π ˙p(t0) r . (11.54) Now you see why it was unnecessary to carry the approximation of beyond the zeroth order ( ≈ r) : p is already first order in r′, and any refinements would be corrections of second order (or higher). Next we must calculate the fields. Once again, we are interested in the radiation zone (that is, in the fields that survive at large distances from the source), so we keep only those terms that go like 1/r: approximation 3: discard 1/r 2 terms in E and B. (11.55) For instance, the Coulomb field, E = 1 4πϵ0 Q r2 ˆr, coming from the first term in Eq. 11.51, does not contribute to the electro- magnetic radiation. In fact, the radiation comes entirely from those terms in which we differentiate the argument t0.From Eq. 11.48 it follows that ∇t0 = − 1 c ∇r = − 1 cˆr, 485 11.1 Dipole Radiation and hence ∇V ≈ ∇[ 1 4πϵ0 ˆr · ˙p(t0) rc ] ≈ 1 4πϵ0 [ˆr · ¨p(t0) rc ]∇t0 = − 1 4πϵ0c2 [ˆr · ¨p(t0)] r ˆr. Similarly, ∇ × A ≈ μ0 4πr [∇ × ˙p(t0)] = μ0 4πr [(∇t0) × ¨p(t0)] = − μ0 4πrc [ˆr × ¨p(t0)], while ∂A ∂t ≈ μ0 4π ¨p(t0) r . So E(r, t) ≈ μ0 4πr [(ˆr · ¨p)ˆr − ¨p] = μ0 4πr [ˆr × (ˆr × ¨p)], (11.56) where ¨p is evaluated at time t0 = t − r/c,and B(r, t) ≈− μ0 4πrc [ˆr × ¨p]. (11.57) In particular, if we use spherical polar coordinates, with the z-axis in the direction of ¨p(t0), then E(r, θ, t) ≈ μ0¨p(t0) 4π ( sin θ r ) ˆθ, B(r, θ, t) ≈ μ0¨p(t0) 4πc ( sin θ r ) ˆφ. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (11.58) The Poynting vector is S(r, t) ≈ 1 μ0 (E × B) = μ0 16π2c [ ¨p(t0)]2 ( sin2 θ r2 )ˆr, (11.59) the power passing through a giant spherical surface at radius r is P(r, t) = ∮ S(r, t) · da = μ0 6πc [¨p(t − r c ) ] 2, and the total radiated power (Eq. 11.2)is Prad(t0) ≈ μ0 6πc [ ¨p(t0)]2. (11.60) Notice that E and B are mutually perpendicular, transverse to the direction of propagation (ˆr),andinthe ratio E/B = c, as always for radiation fields. Example 11.2. (a) In the case of an oscillating electric dipole, p(t) = p0 cos(ωt), ¨p(t) = −ω2p0 cos(ωt), and we recover the results of Section 11.1.2. 486 11 Radiation (b) For a single point charge q, the dipole moment is p(t) = qd(t), where d is the position of q with respect to the origin. Accordingly, ¨p(t) = qa(t), where a is the acceleration of the charge. In this case the power radiated (Eq. 11.60)is P = μ0q 2a 2 6πc . (11.61) This is the famous Larmor formula; I’ll derive it again, by rather different means, in the next section. Notice that the power radiated by a point charge is proportional to the square of its acceleration. What I have done in this section amounts to a multipole expansion of the retarded potentials, carried to the lowest order in r′ that is capable of producing electromagnetic radiation (fields that go like 1/r). This turns out to be the electric dipole term. Because charge is conserved, an electric monopole does not radiate – if charge were not conserved, the first term in Eq. 11.51 would read Vmono = 1 4πϵ0 Q(t0) r , and we would get a monopole field proportional to 1/r: Emono = 1 4πϵ0c ˙Q(t0) r ˆr. You might think that a charged sphere whose radius oscillates in and out would radiate, but it doesn’t – the field outside, according to Gauss’s law, is exactly (Q/4πϵ0r 2)ˆr, regardless of the fluctuations in size. (In the acoustical analog, by the way, monopoles do radiate: witness the croak of a bullfrog.) If the electric dipole moment should happen to vanish (or, at any rate, if its second time derivative is zero), then there is no electric dipole radiation, and one must look to the next term: the one of second order in r′.As it happens, this term can be separated into two parts, one of which is relatedtothe magnetic dipole moment of the source, the other to its electric quadrupole moment. (The former is a generalization of the magnetic dipole radiation we considered in Section 11.1.3.) If the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions vanish, the (r′)3 term must be considered. This yields magnetic quadrupole and electric octopole radiation … and so it goes. Problem 11.8. A parallel-plate capacitor C, with plate separation d, is given an initial charge (±)Q0. It is then connected to a resistor R, and discharges, Q(t) = Q0e−t/RC. 487 11.2 Power Radiated by a Point Charge (a) What fraction of its initial energy (Q2 0/2C) does it radiate away? (b) If C = 1 pF, R = 1000 Ω,and d = 0.1 mm, what is the actual number? In electronics we don’t ordinarily worry about radiative losses; does that seem reasonable, in this case? Problem 11.9. Apply Eqs. 11.59 and 11.60 to the rotating dipole of Prob. 11.4. Explain any apparent discrepancies with your previous answer. Problem 11.10. An insulating circular ring (radius b) lies in the xy plane, centered at the origin. It carries a linear charge density λ = λ0 sin φ,where λ0 is constant and φ is the usual azimuthal angle. The ring is now set spinning at a constant angular velocity ω about the z-axis. Calculate the power radiated. ! Problem 11.11. Acurrent I (t) flows around the circular ring in Fig. 11.8. Derive the general formula for the power radiated (analogous to Eq. 11.60), expressing your answer in terms of the magnetic dipole moment, m(t),ofthe loop.[Answer: P = μ0 ¨m2/6πc3.] 11.2 Power Radiated by a Point Charge 11.2.1 The Larmor Formula In Chapter 10 we derived the fields of a point charge q in arbitrary motion (Eqs. 10.72 and 10.73): E(r, t) = q 4πϵ0 ( · u)3 [(c2 − v2)u + × (u × a)], (11.62) where u = cˆ − v,and B(r, t) = 1 c ˆ × E(r, t). (11.63) The first term in Eq. 11.62 is the velocity field, and the second one (with the triple cross product) is the acceleration field. The Poynting vector is S = 1 μ0 (E × B) = 1 μ0c [E × (ˆ × E)] = 1 μ0c [E2ˆ − (ˆ · E)E]. (11.64) However, not all of this energy flux constitutes radiation; some of it is just field energy carried along by the particle as it moves. The radiated energy is the stuff that, in effect, detaches itself from the charge and propagates off to infinity. (It’s like flies breeding on a garbage truck: some of them hover around the truck as it makes its rounds; others fly away and never come back.) To calculate the total power radiated by the particle at time t,we draw a huge sphere of radius (Fig. 11.10), centered at the position of the particle (at time t). At the later time ts ≡ t + c , (11.65) 488 11 Radiation w(tr) w(t) q Fig. 11.10 the radiation reaches the sphere, and at that moment we integrate the Poynting vector over the surface.9 Notice that for all points on the sphere (at time ts), t = ts − /c is precisely the retarded time (Eq. 10.25), so in evaluating the fields we’ll need the position, velocity, and acceleration of the charge at time t, when the radiation left the source. Now, the area of the sphere is proportional to 2,soany term in S that goes like 1/ 2 will yield a finite answer, but terms like 1/ 3 or 1/ 4 will contribute nothing in the limit →∞. For this reason, only the accel- eration fields represent true radiation (hence their other name, radiation fields): Erad = q 4πϵ0 ( · u)3 [ × (u × a)]. (11.66) The velocity fields carry energy, to be sure, and as the charge moves this energy is dragged along – but it’s not radiation. (It’s like the flies that stay with the garbage truck.) Now Erad is perpendicular to ˆ, so the second term in Eq. 11.64 vanishes: Srad = 1 μ0c E2 radˆ. (11.67) If the charge is instantaneously at rest (at time t), then u = cˆ,and Erad = q 4πϵ0c2 [ˆ × (ˆ × a)] = μ0q 4π [(ˆ · a)ˆ − a]. (11.68) In that case, Srad = 1 μ0c ( μ0q 4π ) 2[a 2 − (ˆ · a)2]ˆ = μ0q 2a 2 16π2c ( sin2 θ 2 ) ˆ, (11.69) where θ is the angle between ˆ and a. No power is radiated in the forward or backward direction – rather, it is emitted in a donut about the direction of instantaneous acceleration (Fig. 11.11). The total power radiated (at time t)is P = ∮ Srad · da = μ0q 2a 2 16π2c ∫ sin2 θ 2 2 sin θ dθ dφ 9 There is a subtle change in strategy here: in Section 11.1 we worked from a fixed point (the origin), but here it is more appropriate to use the (moving) location of the charge. The implications of this change in perspective will become clearer in a moment. 489 11.2 Power Radiated by a Point Charge a θ Fig. 11.11 (where a is the acceleration at time t)or P = μ0q 2a 2 6πc . (11.70) This, again, is the Larmor formula, which we obtained earlier by a quite different route (Eq. 11.61). Although I derived Eqs. 11.69 and 11.70 on the assumption that v = 0, they actually hold to good approximation as long as v ≪ c. 10 I’ll treat the general case (v \u0002 0) in a moment, but first I want to call your attention to the connection between radiation and acceleration,as spotlighted by the Larmor formula. A particle at rest does not radiate; nor does a particle moving at constant velocity … but if it’s accelerating, then it radiates. Wait a minute! What about a uniformly charged circular ring (radius R) rotating at a constant angular velocity (ω) about its axis? That’s a steady current, the electric and magnetic fields are static, and it certainly doesn’t radiate. And yet, every point on the ring is accelerating (a = ω2R). Or consider a uniformly charged spherical shell (radius R) that “breathes” in and out sinusoidally (R(t) = R0 cos ωt); for r > R0 the electric field is Coulombic, and the magnetic field is zero everywhere. No radiation … and yet every point on the shell is accelerating. Doesn’t the Larmor formula say that acceleration generates radiation? Yes: but the Larmor formula applies to point charges, whereas these are extended objects. Remember, the Poynting vector does not satisfy the superposition principle – the total power radiated is not the sum of the powers that would be radiated by each electron separately. If you like, what we have in these examples is perfect destructive interference in every direction.11 11.2.2 The Liénard Formula The exact treatment of the general case (v \u0002 0) is harder, both for the obvi- ous reason that Erad is more complicated, and also for the subtler reason 10 In the context of special relativity, the condition v = 0 simply represents an astute choice of reference frame, with no essential loss of generality. If you can figure out how P transforms, you can deduce the general (Liénard) result from the v = 0 (Larmor) formula (see Prob. 12.74). 11 T. A. Abbott and D. J. Griffiths, Am. J. Phys. 53, 1203 (1985). 490 11 Radiation c v Fig. 11.12 that Srad, the rate at which energy passes through the sphere (Fig. 11.10)is not the same as the rate at which that energy left the particle. To understand why, imagine someone is firing a stream of bullets out the window of a moving car (Fig. 11.12). The rate Nt at which the bullets strike a stationary target is not the same as the rate Ng at which they left the gun, because of the motion of the car. In fact, you can easily check that Ng = (1 − v/c)Nt, if the car is moving toward the target, and Ng = (1 − ˆ · v c )Nt for arbitrary directions (here v is the velocity of the car, c is the speed of the bullets – relative to the ground – and ˆ is a unit vector from car to target). More formally, if dW /dts is the rate at which energy passes through the sphere at radius , then the rate at which energy left the charge was dW dt = dW dts ∂ts ∂t = ( · u c ) dW dts . (11.71) (I used Eq. 10.78 to get ∂t/∂ts.) But · u c = 1 − ˆ · v c , which is precisely the ratio of Ng to Nt; it’s a purely geometrical factor (the same as in the Doppler effect). The power radiated by the particle into a patch of area 2 sin θ dθ dφ = 2 dΩ on the sphere is therefore given by dP dΩ = ( · u c ) 1 μ0c E2 rad 2 = q 2 16π2ϵ0 |ˆ × (u × a)|2 (ˆ · u)5 , (11.72) where dΩ = sin θ dθ dφ is the solid angle into which this power is radiated. Integrating over θ and φ to get the total power radiated is no picnic, and for now I shall simply quote the answer: P = ∫ dP dΩ sin θ dθ dφ = μ0q 2γ6 6πc (a 2 − ||| v × a c ||| 2), (11.73) where γ ≡ 1/ √1 − v2/c2. This is Liénard’s generalization of the Larmor formula (to which it reduces when v ≪ c). The factor γ6 means that the radiated power increases enormously as the particle velocity approaches the speed of light. 491 11.2 Power Radiated by a Point Charge Example 11.3. Suppose that v and a are instantaneously collinear (at time t), as (for example) in straight-line motion. Find the angular distribution of the radiation (Eq. 11.72) and the total power emitted. Solution. In this case (u × a) = c(ˆ × a),so dP dΩ = q 2c2 16π2ϵ0 |ˆ × (ˆ × a)|2 (c − ˆ · v)5 . Now ˆ × (ˆ × a) = (ˆ · a)ˆ − a,so |ˆ × (ˆ × a)|2 = a 2 − (ˆ · a)2. In particular, if we let the z-axis point along v, then dP dΩ = μ0q 2a 2 16π2c sin2 θ (1 − β cos θ)5 , (11.74) where β ≡ v/c. This is consistent, of course, with Eq. 11.69,in the case v = 0. However, for very large v (β ≈ 1) the donut of radiation (Fig. 11.11) is stretched out and pushed forward by the factor (1 − β cos θ)−5, as indicated in Fig. 11.13. Although there is still no radiation in precisely the forward direction, most of it is concentrated within an increasingly narrow cone about the forward direction (see Prob. 11.15). The total power emitted is found by integrating Eq. 11.74 over all angles: P = μ0q 2a 2 16π2c ∫ sin2 θ (1 − β cos θ)5 sin θ dθ dφ. The φ integral is 2π;the θ integral is simplified by the substitution x ≡ cos θ: P = μ0q 2a 2 8πc ∫ +1 −1 (1 − x 2) (1 − βx)5 dx. Integration by parts yields 4 3 (1 − β2)−3, and I conclude that P = μ0q 2a 2γ6 6πc . (11.75) This result is consistent with the Liénard formula (Eq. 11.73), for the case of collinear v and a. Notice that the angular distribution of the radiation is the same whether the particle is accelerating or decelerating; it only depends on the square of a, and is concentrated in the forward direction (with respect to the velocity) in either case. When a high speed electron hits a metal target it rapidly decelerates, giving off what is called bremsstrahlung, or “braking radiation.” What I have described in this example is essentially the classical theory of bremsstrahlung. Problem 11.12. An electron is released from rest and falls under the influence of gravity. In the first centimeter, what fraction of the potential energy lost is radiated away? 492 11 Radiation Problem 11.13. A positive charge q is fired head-on at a distant positive charge Q (which is held stationary), with an initial velocity v0. It comes in, decelerates to v = 0,and returnsout to infinity. What fraction of its initial energy ( 1 2 mv2 0) is radiated away? Assume v0 ≪ c,and that you can safely ignore the effect of radiative losses on the motion of the particle. [Answer: (16/45)(q/Q)(v0/c)3.] Problem 11.14. In Bohr’s theory of hydrogen, the electron in its ground state was supposed to travel in a circle of radius 5 × 10−11 m, held in orbit by the Coulomb attraction of the proton. According to classical electrodynamics, this electron should radiate, and hence spiral in tothenucleus.Showthat v ≪ c for most of the trip (so you can use the Larmor formula), and calculate the lifespan of Bohr’s atom. (Assume each revolution is essentially circular.) x z v θmax Fig. 11.13 θ φ Fig. 11.14 Fig. 11.15 Problem 11.15. Find the angle θmax at which the maximum radiation is emitted, in Ex. 11.3 (Fig. 11.13). Show that for ultrarelativistic speeds (v close to c), θmax ≈ √(1 − β)/2. What is the intensity of the radiation in this maximal direction (in the ultrarelativistic case), in proportion to the same quantity for a particle instantaneously at rest? Give your answer in terms of γ. ! Problem 11.16. In Ex. 11.3 we assumed the velocity and acceleration were (instantaneously, at least) collinear. Carry out the same analysis for the case where they are perpendicular. Choose your axes so that v lies along the z-axis and a along the x-axis (Fig. 11.14), so that v = vˆz, 493 11.3 The Radiation Reaction a = aˆx,and ˆ = sin θ cos φ ˆx + sin θ sin φ ˆy + cos θ ˆz.Checkthat P is consistent with the Liénard formula. [Answer: dP dΩ = μ0q2a2 16π2c [(1 − β cos θ)2 − (1 − β2) sin2 θ cos2 φ] (1 − β cos θ)5 , P = μ0q2a2γ4 6πc . For relativistic velocities (β ≈ 1) the radiation is again sharply peaked in the forward direction (Fig. 11.15). The most important application of these formulas is to circular motion – in this case the radiation is called synchrotron radiation. For a relativistic electron, the radiation sweeps around like a locomotive’s headlight as the particle moves.] 11.3 The Radiation Reaction When a charged particle accelerates, it radiates. This radiation carries off energy, which must come at the expense of some other form – kinetic, potential, or energy stored in the nonradiative fields of the particle. Under the influence of a given force, therefore, the acceleration of a charged particle is typically less than – or at any rate different from – that of a neutral particle of the same mass. Evidently, the fields exert a force (Frad) back on the charge – a recoil force, rather like that of a bullet on a gun. In the next section I’ll derive this radiation reaction force from conservation of energy. Then, in the following section, I’ll show you the actual mechanism responsible, and derive the reaction force again in the context of a simple model. 11.3.1 The Abraham–Lorentz Formula For a nonrelativistic particle (v ≪ c), the total power radiated is given by the Larmor formula (Eq. 11.70): P = μ0q 2a 2 6πc . (11.76) Conservation of energy suggests that this is also the rate at which the particle loses energy, under the influence of the radiation reaction force Frad: Frad · v = − μ0q 2a 2 6πc . (11.77) I say “suggests” advisedly, because this equation is actually wrong.For we calculated the radiated power by integrating the Poynting vector over a sphere of “infinite” radius; in this calculation the velocity fields played no part, since they fall off too rapidly as a function of to make any contribution. But these “local” fields do carry energy – they just don’t transport it out to infinity. As the particle accelerates and decelerates, energy is exchanged between it and the nearby fields, at the same time as energy is irretrievably radiated away by the acceleration fields. Equation 11.77 494 11 Radiation accounts only for the latter, but if we want to know the recoil force exerted by the fields on the charge, we need to consider the total power lost at any instant, not just the portion that eventually escapes in the form of radiation. (The term “radiation reaction” is a misnomer. We should really call it the field reaction. In fact, we’ll soon see that Frad is determined by the time derivative of the acceleration and can be nonzero even when the acceleration itself is instantaneously zero, and hence the particle is not radiating.) The energy lost by the particle in any given time interval, then, must equal the energy carried away by the radiation plus whatever extra energy has been pumped into the nearby fields. 12 However, if we agree to consider only intervals over which the system returns to its initial state, then the energy in the velocity fields is the same at both ends, and the only net loss is in the form of radiation. Thus Eq. 11.77, while incorrect instantaneously, is valid on the average: ∫ t2 t1 Frad · v dt = − μ0q 2 6πc ∫ t2 t1 a 2 dt, (11.78) with the stipulation that the state of the system is identical at t1 and t2. In the case of periodic motion, for instance, we must integrate over an integral number of full cycles.13 Now, the right-hand side of Eq. 11.78 can be integrated by parts: ∫ t2 t1 a 2 dt = ∫ t2 t1 ( dv dt ) · ( dv dt ) dt = (v · dv dt )||| t2 t1 − ∫ t2 t1 d2v dt2 · v dt. The boundary term drops out, since the velocities and accelerations are identical at t1 and t2,so Eq. 11.78 can be written equivalently as ∫ t2 t1 (Frad − μ0q 2 6πc ˙a) · v dt = 0. (11.79) Equation 11.79 will certainly be satisfied if Frad = μ0q 2 6πc ˙a. (11.80) This is the Abraham–Lorentz formula 14 for the radiation reaction force. 12 Actually, while the total field is the sum of velocity and acceleration fields, E = Ev + Ea,the energy is proportional to E2 = E2 v + 2Ev · Ea + E2 a and contains three terms: energy stored in the velocity fields alone (E2 v ), energy radiated away (E2 a ), and a cross term Ev · Ea.For the sake of simplicity, I’m referring to the combination (E2 v + 2Ev · Ea) as “energy stored in the nearby fields.” These terms go like 1/ 4 and 1/ 3, respectively, so neither one contributes to the radiation. 13 For nonperiodic motion the condition that the energy in the velocity fields be the same at t1 and t2 is more difficult to achieve. It is not enough that the instantaneous velocities and accelerations be equal, since the fields farther out depend on v and a at earlier times.In principle, then, v and a and all higher derivatives must be identical at t1 and t2.Inpractice, since the velocity fields fall off rapidly with , it is sufficient that v and a be the same over a brief interval prior to t1 and t2. 14 This formula was first obtained by Lorentz in 1892 using the self-force method (Section 11.3.2); Planck pioneered the conservation-of-energy approach; Abraham 495 11.3 The Radiation Reaction Of course, Eq. 11.79 doesn’t prove Eq. 11.80. It says nothing whatever about the component of Frad perpendicular to v, and it only tells you the time average of the parallel component – the average, moreover, over very special time intervals. As we’ll see in the next section, there are other reasons for believing in the Abraham–Lorentz formula, but for now, the best that can be said is that it represents the simplest form the radiation reaction force could take, consistent with conservation of energy. The Abraham–Lorentz formula has disturbing implications, which are not entirely understood more than a century after the law was first pro- posed. For suppose a particle is subject to no external forces; then Newton’s second law says Frad = μ0q 2 6πc ˙a = ma, from which it follows that a(t) = a0et/τ, (11.81) where τ ≡ μ0q 2 6πmc . (11.82) (In the case of the electron, τ = 6×10 −24 s.) The acceleration spontaneously increases exponentially with time! This absurd conclusion can be avoided if we insist that a0 = 0, but it turns out that the systematic exclusion of such runaway solutions has an even more unpleasant consequence: if you do apply an external force, the particle starts to respond before the force acts! (See Prob. 11.19.) This acausal preacceleration jumps the gun by only a short time τ; nevertheless, it is (to my mind) unacceptable that the theory should countenance it at all. 15 Example 11.4. Calculate the radiation damping of a charged particle attached to a spring of natural frequency ω0, driven at frequency ω. Solution. The equation of motion is m¨x = Fspring + Frad + Fdriving = −mω2 0x + mτ... x + Fdriving. With the system oscillating at frequency ω, x(t) = x0 cos(ωt + δ), so ... x = −ω2 ˙x. polished both arguments, and generalized them to higher velocity; Dirac (1938) published a fully relativistic account. For the full history see K. T. McDonald, http://kirkmcd.princeton .edu/examples/selfforce.pdf. 15 These difficulties persist in the relativistic version of the Abraham–Lorentz equation, which can be derived by starting with Liénard’s formula instead of Larmor’s (Prob. 12.75). Perhaps they are telling us that there can be no such thing as a point charge in classical electrodynamics, or maybe they presage the onset of quantum mechanics. For guides to the literature, see P. Pearle’s chapter in D. Teplitz, ed., Electromagnetism: Paths to Research, Plenum, New York (1982) and F. Rohrlich, Am.J.Phys. 65, 1051 (1997). 496 11 Radiation Therefore m¨x + mγ ˙x + mω2 0x = Fdriving, (11.83) and the damping factor γ is given by γ = ω2τ. (11.84) [When I wrote Fdamping = −γmv,backin Chapter 9 (Eq. 9.154), I assumed for simplicity that the damping was proportional to the velocity. We now know that radiation damping, at least, is proportional to ¨v. But it hardly matters: for sinusoidal oscillations any even number of derivatives of v would do, since they’re all proportional to v.] Example 11.5. An electric dipole consists of a negative charge (−q) nailed down at the origin, and a positive charge (+q)heldatreston the z-axis (z = d). At time t = 0 the positive charge (mass m) is released, and accelerates toward the negative charge. Leaving aside the radiation reaction (which is a small perturbation) the force on q is F = − 1 4πϵ0 q 2 z2 ˆz = ma, so its acceleration is a = F m = − q 2 4πϵ0m 1 z2 ˆz. Differentiating with respect to t, ˙a = − q 2 4πϵ0m ( −2 z3 ) dz dt ˆz = − 2q 2 4πϵ0m v z3 ˆz (note that dz/dt = − v, since the derivative is negative). The radiation reaction (Eq. 11.80) is therefore Frad = μ0q 2 6πc ˙a = − μ0q 4 12π2ϵ0m ( v c ) 1 z3 ˆz. The details are of little interest – what’s remarkable is the sign:it’s in the same direction as F itself. This is not a brake, but an accelerator! At the same time that the system as a whole is losing energy in the form of radiation, q is actually gaining energy. (Of course, as it falls the particle gains kinetic energy and loses potential energy; absent the radiation reaction the total would be constant. We’re talking about the extra energy associated with the radiation reaction.) Where is it coming from? It’s coming from the fields, which are shedding energy in both directions. 16 What does this tell us? Not much, I’m afraid, except to emphasize that the name “radiation reaction” can be seriously misleading. 16 Several authors have noted that the Poynting vector close to a decaying electric dipole points inward, whereas farther out it points outward (as it must, of course, to describe radiation). See H. G. Schantz, Am. J. Phys. 63, 513 (1995), or K. T. McDonald, http:// kirkmcd.princeton.edu/examples/collapse.pdf. 497 11.3 The Radiation Reaction Problem 11.17. (a) A particle of charge q moves in a circle of radius R at a constant speed v. To sustain the motion, you must, of course, provide a centripetal force mv2/R;what additional force (Fe) must you exert, in order to counteract the radiation reaction? [It’s easiest to express the answer in terms of the instantaneous velocity v.] What power (Pe)doesthisextra force deliver? Compare Pe with the power radiated (use the Larmor formula). (b) Repeat part (a) for a particle in simple harmonic motion with amplitude A and angular frequency ω: w(t) = A cos(ωt)ˆz. Explain the discrepancy. (c) Consider the case of a particle in free fall (constant acceleration g). What is the radiation reaction force? What is the power radiated? Comment on these results. Problem 11.18. A point charge q,ofmass m, is attached to a spring of constant k.Attime t = 0 it is given a kick, so its initial energy is U0 = 1 2 mv2 0. Now it oscillates, gradually radiating away this energy. (a) Confirm that the total energy radiated is equal to U0. Assume the radiation damping is small, so you can write the equation of motion as ¨x + γ ˙x + ω2 0x = 0, and the solution as x(t) = v0 ω0 e−γt/2 sin(ω0t), with ω0 ≡ √ k/m, γ = ω2 0τ,and γ ≪ ω0 (drop γ2 in comparison to ω2 0, and when you average over a complete cycle, ignore the change in e−γt). (b) Suppose now we have two such oscillators, and we start them off with identical kicks. Regardless of their relative positions and orientations, the total energy radiated is 2U0. But what if they are right on top of each other, so it’s equivalent to a single oscillator with twice the charge; the Larmor formula says that the power radiated is four timesasgreat, suggesting that the total will be 4U0. Find the error in this reasoning, and show that the total is actually 2U0,asitshouldbe.17 ! Problem 11.19. With the inclusion of the radiation reaction force (Eq. 11.80, Newton’s second law for a charged particle becomes a = τ ˙a + F m , where F is the external force acting on the particle. (a) In contrast to the case of an uncharged particle (a = F/m), acceleration (like position and velocity) must now be a continuous function of time, even if the force changes abruptly. (Physically, the radiation reaction damps out any rapid change in a.) Prove that a is 17 For a more sophisticated version of this paradox, see P. R. Berman, Am.J.Phys. 78, 1323 (2010). 498 11 Radiation continuous at any time t, by integrating the equation of motion from (t − ϵ) to (t + ϵ) and taking the limit ϵ → 0. (b) A particle is subjected to a constant force F, beginning at time t = 0 and lasting until time T. Find the most general solution a(t) to theequationofmotionineachofthefollowing three periods: (i) t < 0, (ii) 0 < t < T, (iii) t > T. (c) Impose the continuity condition (a) at t = 0 and t = T. Show that you can either eliminate the runaway in region (iii) or avoid preacceleration in region (i), but not both. (d) If you choose to eliminate the runaway, what is the acceleration as a function of time, in each interval? How about the velocity? (The latter must, of course, be continuous at t = 0 and t = T.) Assume the particle was originally at rest: v(−∞) = 0. (e) Plot a(t) and v(t), both for an uncharged particle and for a (nonrunaway) charged particle, subject to this force. 11.3.2 The Self-Force on a Charged Particle In the last section, I derived the Abraham–Lorentz formula for the radia- tion reaction, using conservation of energy. I made no attempt to identify the actual mechanism responsible for this force, except to point out that it must be a recoil effect of the particle’s own fields acting back on the charge. Unfortunately, the fields of a point charge blow up right at the particle, so it’s hard to see how one might calculate the force they exert.18 Let’s avoid this problem by considering an extended charge distribution, for which the field is finite everywhere; at the end, we’ll take the limit as the size of the charge goes to zero. In general, as I noted in Section 8.2.1,the electromagnetic force of one part (A) on another part (B)is not equal and opposite to the force of B on A (Fig. 11.16). If the distribution is divided up into infinitesimal chunks, and the imbalances are added up for all such pairs, the result is a net force of the charge on itself. It is this self-force, resulting from the breakdown of Newton’s third law within the structure of the particle, that accounts for the radiation reaction. Lorentz originally calculated the electromagnetic self-force using a spherical charge distribution, which seems reasonable but makes the mathematics rather cumbersome.19 Because I am only trying to elucidate the mechanism involved, I shall use a less realistic model: a “dumbbell” in which the total charge q is divided into two halves separated by a fixed distance d (Fig. 11.17). This is the simplest possible arrangement of the charge that permits the essential mechanism (imbalance of internal electromagnetic forces) to function. Never mind that it’s an unlikely model for an elementary particle: in the point limit (d → 0) any model must yield 18 It can be done by a suitable averaging of the field, but it’s not easy. See T. H. Boyer, Am. J. Phys. 40, 1843 (1972), and references cited there. 19 See J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., John Wiley, New York (1999), Sect. 16.3. 499 11.3 The Radiation Reaction Fig. 11.16 Fig. 11.17 the Abraham–Lorentz formula, to the extent that conservation of energy alone dictates that answer. Let’s assume the dumbbell moves in the x direction, and is (instanta- neously) at rest at the retarded time. The electric field at (1) due to (2) is E1 = (q/2) 4πϵ0 ( · u)3 [(c2 + · a)u − ( · u)a] (11.85) (Eq. 10.72), where u = cˆ and = lˆx + dˆy, (11.86) so · u = c , · a = la,and = √ l2 + d2. (11.87) Actually, we’re only interested in the x component of E1, since the y components will cancel when we add the forces on the two ends (for the same reason, we don’t need to worry about the magnetic forces). Now ux = cl , (11.88) and hence E1x = q 8πϵ0c2 (lc2 − ad2) (l2 + d2)3/2 . (11.89) By symmetry, E2x = E1x , so the net force on the dumbbell is Fself = q 2 (E1 + E2) = q 2 8πϵ0c2 (lc2 − ad2) (l2 + d2)3/2 ˆx. (11.90) So far everything is exact. The idea now is to expand in powers of d; when the size of the particle goes to zero, all positive powers will disappear. Using Taylor’s theorem, x(t) = x(tr) + ˙x(tr)(t − tr) + 1 2 ¨x(tr)(t − tr)2 + 1 3! ... x (tr)(t − tr)3 + ··· , we have l = x(t) − x(tr) = 1 2 aT 2 + 1 6 ˙aT 3 + ··· , (11.91) 500 11 Radiation where T ≡ t − tr, for short. Now T is determined by the retarded time condition (cT )2 = l2 + d2, (11.92) so d = √(cT )2 − l2 = cT √ 1 − ( aT 2c + ˙aT 2 6c + ··· ) 2 = cT − a 2 8c T 3 + ()T 4 + ··· . This equation tells us d,interms of T; we need to “solve” it for T as a function of d. There’s a systematic procedure for doing this, known as reversion of series, 20 but we can get the first couple of terms more informally as follows: ignoring all higher powers of T, d ≈ cT ⇒ T ≈ d c ; using this as an approximation for the cubic term, d ≈ cT − a 2 8c d3 c3 ⇒ T ≈ d c + a 2d3 8c5 , and so on. Thus T = 1 c d + a 2 8c5 d3 + ()d4 + ··· . (11.93) Returning to Eq. 11.91, we construct the power series for l in terms of d: l = a 2c2 d2 + ˙a 6c3 d3 + ()d4 + ··· . (11.94) Putting this into Eq. 11.90, I conclude that Fself = q 2 4πϵ0 [− a 4c2d + ˙a 12c3 + ()d + ··· ] ˆx. (11.95) Here a and ˙a are evaluated at the retarded time (tr), but it’s easy to rewrite the result in terms of the present time t: a(tr) = a(t) + ˙a(t)(tr − t) + ··· = a(t) − ˙a(t)T + ··· = a(t) − ˙a(t) d c + ··· , and it follows that Fself = q 2 4πϵ0 [− a(t) 4c2d + ˙a(t) 3c3 + ()d + ··· ] ˆx. (11.96) The first term on the right is proportional to the acceleration of the charge; if we pull it over to the other side of Newton’s second law, it simply adds to the dumbbell’s mass. In effect, the total inertia of the charged dumbbell is m = 2m0 + 1 4πϵ0 q 2 4dc2 , (11.97) 20 See, for example, the CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulas, 32nd ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton (2011). 501 11.3 The Radiation Reaction where m0 is the mass of either end alone. In the context of special relativity, it is not surprising that the electrical repulsion of the charges should enhance the mass of the dumbbell. The potential energy of this configu- ration (in the static case) is 1 4πϵ0 (q/2)2 d , (11.98) and according to Einstein’s formula E = mc2, this energy contributes to the inertia of the object. 21 The second term in Eq. 11.96 is the radiation reaction: F int rad = μ0q 2 ˙a 12πc . (11.99) It alone (apart from the mass correction 22) survives in the “point dumbbell” limit d → 0. Unfortunately, it differs from the Abraham–Lorentz formula by a factor of 2. But then, this is only the self-force associated with the interaction between 1 and 2 – hence the superscript “int.” There remains the force of each end on itself. When the latter is included (see Prob. 11.20), the result is Frad = μ0q 2 ˙a 6πc , (11.100) reproducing the Abraham–Lorentz formula exactly. Conclusion: The radia- tion reaction is due to the force of the charge on itself – or, more elaborately, the net force exerted by the fields generated by different parts of the charge distribution acting on one another. Problem 11.20. Deduce Eq. 11.100 from Eq. 11.99. Here are three methods: (a) Use the Abraham–Lorentz formula to determine the radiation reaction on each end of the dumbbell; add this to the interaction term (Eq. 11.99). (b) Method (a) has the defect that it uses the Abraham–Lorentz formula – the very thing that we were trying to derive. To avoid this, let F (q) be the total d-independent part of the self-force on a charge q.Then F (q) = F int(q) + 2F (q/2), 21 Thefactthatthe numbers work out perfectly is a lucky feature of this configuration. If you do the same calculation for the dumbbell in longitudinal motion, the mass correction is only half of what it “should” be (there’s a 2, instead of a 4, in Eq. 11.97), and for a sphere it’s off by a factor of 3/4. This notorious paradox has been the subject of much debate over the years. See D. J. Griffiths and R. E. Owen, Am.J.Phys. 51, 1120 (1983). 22 Of course, the limit d → 0 has an embarrassing effect on the mass term. In a sense, it doesn’t matter, since only the total mass m is observable; maybe m0 somehow has a compensating (negative!) infinity, so that m comes out finite. This awkward problem persists in quantum electrodynamics, where it is “swept under the rug” in a procedure known as mass renormalization. 502 11 Radiation where F int is the interaction part (Eq. 11.99), and F (q/2) is the self-force on each end. Now, F (q) must be proportional to q2, since the field is proportional to q and the force is qE.So F (q/2) = (1/4)F (q). Take it from there. (c) Smear out the charge along a strip of length L oriented perpendicular to the motion (the charge density, then, is λ = q/L); find the cumulative interaction force for all pairs of segments, using Eq. 11.99 (with the correspondence q/2 → λ dy1, at one end and q/2 → λ dy2 at the other). Make sure you don’t count the same pair twice. ! Problem 11.21.23 An electric dipole rotates at constant angular velocity ω in the xy plane. (The charges, ±q,are at r± = ±R[cos(ωt)ˆx + sin(ωt)ˆy]; the magnitude of the dipole moment is p = 2qR.) (a) Find the interaction term in the self-torque (analogous to Eq. 11.99). Assume the motion is nonrelativistic (ωR ≪ c). (b) Use the method of Prob. 11.20a to obtain the total radiation reaction torque on this system. [Answer: −(μ0p2ω3)ˆz/6πc.] (c) Check that this result is consistent with the power radiated (Eq. 11.60). More Problems on Chapter 11 Problem 11.22. A particle of mass m and charge q is attached to a spring with force constant k, hanging from the ceiling (Fig. 11.18). Its equilibrium position is a distance h above the floor. It is pulled down a distance d below equilibrium and released, at time t = 0. (a) Under the usual assumptions (d ≪ λ ≪ h), calculate the intensity of the radia- tion hitting the floor, as a function of the distance R from the point directly below q. [Note: The intensity here is the average power per unit area of the floor.] At what R is the radiation most intense? Neglect the radiative damping of the oscillator.

Szeto, Am.J.Phys. 46, 244 (1978). 503 More Problems on Chapter 11 (b) As a check on your formula, assume the floor is of infinite extent, and calculate the average energy per unit time striking the entire floor. Is it what you’d expect? (c) Because it is losing energy in the form of radiation, the amplitude of the oscillation will gradually decrease. After what time τ has the amplitude been reduced to d/e? (Assume the fraction of the total energy lost in one cycle is very small.) Problem 11.23. A radio tower rises to height h above flat horizontal ground. At the top is a magnetic dipole antenna, of radius b, with its axis vertical. FM station KRUD broadcasts from this antenna at (angular) frequency ω, with a total radiated power P (that’s averaged, of course, over a full cycle). Neighbors have complained about problems they attribute to excessive radia- tion from the tower – interference with their stereo systems, mechanical garage doors opening and closing mysteriously, and a variety of suspicious medical problems. But the city engineer who measured the radiation level at the base of the tower found it to be well below the accepted standard. You have been hired by the Neighborhood Association to assess the engineer’s report. (a) In terms of the variables given (not all of which may be relevant), find the formula for the intensity of the radiation at ground level, a distance R from the base of the tower. You may assume that b ≪ c/ω ≪ h.[Note: We are interested only in the magnitude of the radiation, not in its direction – when measurements are taken, the detector will be aimed directly at the antenna.] (b) How far from the base of the tower should the engineer have made the measurement? What is the formula for the intensity at this location? (c) KRUD’s actual power output is 35 kW, its frequency is 90 MHz, the antenna’s radius is 6 cm, and the height of the tower is 200 m. The city’s radio-emission limit is 200 μW/cm2. Is KRUD in compliance? z y d \u0004 \u0002 r P θ \u0002p0 cos wt \u0004p0 cos wt Fig. 11.19 ! Problem 11.24. As a model for electric quadrupole radiation, consider two oppositely oriented oscillating electric dipoles, separated by a distance d, as shown in Fig. 11.19. Use the results of Section 11.1.2 for the potentials of each dipole, but note that they are not located at the origin. Keeping only the terms of first order in d: (a) find the scalar and vector potentials; (b) find the electric and magnetic fields; 504 11 Radiation (c) find the Poynting vector and the power radiated, then sketch the intensity profile as a function of θ. Problem 11.25. The geographic poles of the Earth are defined by its axis of rotation; the magnetic poles are off (from this axis) by about 11◦ (and they wander a bit). The north pole of a magnetic compass points (roughly) northward, so the Earth’s magnetic south pole is actually pretty close to its geographic north pole. (Why is this so complicated?) Relative to the fixed axis of rotation, therefore, the magnetic dipole moment of the Earth is changing with time, and the Earth must be giving off magnetic dipole radiation. (a) Find the formula for the total power radiated, in terms of the following parameters: ψ (the angle between the geographic and magnetic poles), M (the magnitude of the Earth’s magnetic dipole moment), and ω (the angular velocity of rotation of the Earth). [Hint: Refer to Prob. 11.4 or Prob. 11.11.] (b) Using the fact that the Earth’s magnetic field is about half a gauss at the equator, estimate the magnetic dipole moment M of the Earth.

An ideal electric dipole is situated at the origin; its dipole moment points in the ˆz direction, and is quadratic in time: p(t) = 1 2 ¨p0t2ˆz (−∞ < t < ∞), where ¨p0 is a constant. (a) Use the method of Section 11.1.2 to determine the (exact) electric and magnetic fields, for all r > 0 (there’s also a delta-function term at the origin, but we’re not concerned with that).

In Section 11.2.1 we calculated the energy per unit time radiated by a (nonrel- ativistic) point charge – the Larmor formula. 24 J. P. Ostriker and J. E. Gunn, Astrophys. J. 157, 1395 (1969). 25 Notice that B(r, t) goes like 1/r2, and one might therefore assume that this configuration does not radiate. However, it is not B(r, t) we require (for Eq. 11.2), but rather B(r, t0 + r/c) – we track the fields as they propagate out to infinity – and B(r, t0 + r/c) has a term that goes like 1/r. 505 More Problems on Chapter 11 (a) In the same spirit, calculate the momentum per unit time radiated. [Answer: (μ0q2/6πc3)a2v.] (b) Similarly, calculate the angular momentum per unit time radiated. [Answer: (μ0q2/6πc)(v × a).] Problem 11.28.

Use the duality transformation (Prob. 7.68)toconstructtheelectricandmag- netic fields of a magnetic monopole qm in arbitrary motion, and find the “Larmor formula”for the power radiated.27 Problem 11.30. Assuming you exclude the runaway solution in Prob. 11.19, calculate: (a) the work done by the external force; (b) the final kinetic energy (assume the initial kinetic energy was zero); (c) the total energy radiated. (d) Check that energy is conserved in this process.28 26 For discussion and related problems, see B. R. Holstein, Am.J.Phys. 63, 217 (1995); T. A. Abbott and D. J.

Pollack. 506 11 Radiation Problem 11.31. (a) Repeat Prob. 11.19, but this time let the external force be a Dirac delta function: F (t) = kδ(t) (for some constant k).29 [Note that the acceleration is now discontinuous at t = 0 (though the velocity must still be continuous); use the method of Prob. 11.19a to show that Δa = −k/mτ. In this problem there are only two intervals to consider: (i) t < 0 and (ii) t > 0.] (b) As in Prob. 11.30, check that energy is conserved in this process. ! Problem 11.32. A charged particle, traveling in from −∞ along the x-axis, encounters a rectangular potential energy barrier U (x) = ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪ ⎩ U0 if 0 < x < L, 0 otherwise. Show that, because of the radiation reaction, it is possible for the particle to tunnel through the barrier – that is, even if the incident kinetic energy is less than U0, the particle can pass through.30 [Hint: Your task is to solve the equation a = τ ˙a + F m , subject to the force F (x) = U0[−δ(x) + δ(x − L)]. Refer to Probs. 11.19 and 11.31, but notice that this time the force is a specified function of x,not t. There are three regions to consider: (i) x < 0, (ii) 0 < x < L, (iii) x > L.Findthe general solution for a(t), v(t),and x(t) in each region, exclude the runaway in region (iii), and impose the appropriate boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L. Show that the final velocity (vf ) is related to the time T spent traversing the barrier by the equation L = vf T − U0 mvf (τe−T/τ + T − τ), and the initial velocity (at x = −∞)is vi = vf − U0 mvf [1 − 1 1 + U0 mv2 f (e−T/τ − 1) ]. To simplify these results (since all we’re looking for is a specific example), suppose the final kinetic energy is half the barrier height. Show that in this case vi = vf 1 − (L/vf τ) . In particular, if you choose L = vf τ/4,then vi = (4/3)vf , the initial kinetic energy is (8/9)U0, and the particle makes it through, even though it didn’t have sufficient energy to get over the barrier!] 29 This example was first analyzed by P.

An infinite plane (might as well make it the yz plane) is electrically neutral but carries a sinusoidal surface current K(t) = K0 cos(ωt)ˆz. (a) By whatever means you can think of (short of plagiarism) deduce the electric and magnetic fields it produces. (If you use guesswork or divine inspiration, be sure to check that your results satisfy Maxwell’s equations and the appropriate boundary conditions.) (b) Construct the Poynting vector and its time average. By integrating the latter over a “pillbox” straddling the current, determine the (average) power radiated, per unit area. (c) Check that your answer to (b) is consistent with the power delivered to the surface by whoever is driving the current. 31 T. Fulton and F. Rohrlich, Ann. Phys. 9, 499 (1960); J.

By “inertial” I mean that the system is at rest or moving with constant velocity.1 Imagine, for example, that you have loaded a billiard table onto a railroad car, and the train is going at constant speed down a smooth straight track. The game will proceed exactly the same as it would if the train were parked in the station; you don’t have to “correct” your shots for the fact that the train is moving – indeed, if you pulled all the curtains, you would have no way of knowing whether the train was moving or not. Notice by contrast that you know immediately if the train speeds up, or slows down, or rounds a corner, or goes over a bump – the billiard balls roll in weird curved trajectories, and you yourself feel a lurch and spill coffee on your shirt. The laws of mechanics, then, are certainly not the same in accelerating reference frames. In its application to classical mechanics, the principle of relativity is hardly new; it was stated clearly by Galileo. Question: Does it also apply to the laws of electrodynamics? At first glance, the answer would seem to be no. After all, a charge in motion produces a magnetic field, whereas a charge at rest does not. A charge carried along by the train would generate a magnetic field, but someone on the train, applying the laws of electrodynamics in that system, would predict no magnetic field. In fact, many of the equations of electrodynamics, starting with the Lorentz force law, make explicit reference to “the” velocity of the charge. It certainly appears, therefore, that electromagnetic theory presupposes the existence of a unique stationary reference frame, with respect to which all velocities are to be measured. 1 This raises an awkward problem: if the laws of physics hold just as well in a uniformly moving frame, then we have no way of identifying the “rest” frame in the first place, and hence no way of checking that some other frame is moving at constant velocity. To avoid this trap, we define an inertial frame formally as one in which Newton’s first law holds.If you want to know whether you’re in an inertial frame, throw some rocks around – if they travel in straight lines at constant speed, you’ve got yourself an inertial frame, and any frame moving at constant velocity with respect to you will be another inertial frame (see Prob. 12.1). 509 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity Wire loop B Fig. 12.1 And yet there is an extraordinary coincidence that caught Einstein’s eye. Suppose we mount a wire loop on a freight car, and have the train pass between the poles of a giant magnet (Fig. 12.1). As the loop rides through the magnetic field, a motional emf is established; according to the flux rule (Eq. 7.13), E = − dΦ dt . This emf, remember, is due to the magnetic force on charges in the wire loop, which are moving along with the train. On the other hand, if someone on the train naïvely applied the laws of electrodynamics in that system, what would the prediction be? No magnetic force, because the loop is at rest. But as the magnet flies by, the magnetic field in the freight car changes, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, by Faraday’s law. The resulting electric force would generate an emf in the loop given by Eq. 7.23: E = − dΦ dt . Because Faraday’s law and the flux rule predict exactly the same emf, people on the train will get the right answer, even though their physical interpretation of the process is completely wrong! Or is it? Einstein could not believe this was a mere coincidence; he took it, rather, as a clue that electromagnetic phenomena, like mechanical ones, obey the principle of relativity. In his view, the analysis by the observer on the train is just as valid as that of the observer on the ground. If their interpretations differ (one calling the process electric, the other magnetic), so be it; their actual predictions are in agreement. Here’s what he wrote on the first page of his 1905 paper introducing the special theory of relativity: It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics – as usually understood at the present time – when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighborhood of the magnet an 510 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity electric field … producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighborhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force … which gives rise – assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed – to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case. Examples of this sort, together with unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relative to the “light medium,” suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest.2 But I’m getting ahead of the story. To Einstein’s predecessors, the equality of the two emfs was just a lucky accident; they had no doubt that one observer was right and the other was wrong. They thought of electric and magnetic fields as strains in an invisible jellylike medium called ether, which permeates all of space. The speed of the charge was to be measured with respect to the ether – only then would the laws of electrodynamics be valid. The train observer is wrong, because that frame is moving relative to the ether. But wait a minute! How do we know the ground observer isn’t moving relative to the ether, too? After all, the Earth rotates on its axis once a day and revolves around the Sun once a year; the solar system circulates around the galaxy, and for all I know the Galaxy itself is moving at a high speed through the cosmos. All told, we should be traveling at well over 50 km/s with respect to the ether. Like a motorcycle rider on the open road, we face an “ether wind” of high velocity – unless by some miraculous coincidence we just happen to find ourselves in a tailwind of precisely the right strength, or the Earth has some sort of “windshield” and drags its local supply of ether along with it. Suddenly it becomes a matter of crucial importance to find the ether frame, experimentally, or else all our calculations will be invalid. The problem, then, is to determine our motion through the ether – to measure the speed and direction of the “ether wind.” How shall we do it? At first glance you might suppose that practically any electromagnetic experiment would suffice: if Maxwell’s equations are valid only with respect to the ether frame, any discrepancy between the experimental result and the theoretical prediction would be ascribable to the ether wind. Unfortunately, as nineteenth-century physicists soon realized, the anticipated error in a typical experiment is extremely small; as in the example above, “coinci- dences” always seem to conspire to hide the fact that we are using the “wrong” reference frame. So it takes an uncommonly delicate experiment to do the job. 2 A translation of Einstein’s first relativity paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” is reprinted in H. A. Lorentz et al., The Principle of Relativity,Dover,New York (1923). 511 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity Ether wind Speed of light Fig. 12.2 Now, among the results of classical electrodynamics is the prediction that electromagnetic waves travel through the vacuum at a speed 1 √ϵ0μ0 = 3.00 × 10 8 m/s, relative (presumably) to the ether. In principle, then, one should be able to detect the ether wind by simply measuring the speed of light in various directions. Like a motorboat on a river, the net speed “downstream” should be a maximum, for here the light is swept along by the ether; in the opposite direction, where it is bucking the current, the speed should be a minimum (Fig. 12.2). While the idea of this experiment could not be simpler, its execution is another matter, because light travels so inconveniently fast. If it weren’t for that “technical detail,” you could do it with a flashlight and a stopwatch. As it happened, an elaborate and lovely experiment was conducted by Michelson and Morley in the 1880s, using an optical interferometer of fantastic precision. I shall not go into the details here, because I do not want to distract your attention from the two essential points: (1) all Michelson and Morley were trying to do was compare the speed of light in different directions, and (2) what they in fact discovered was that this speed is exactly the same in all directions. Nowadays, when students are taught in high school to snicker at the naïveté of the ether model, it takes some imagination to comprehend how utterly perplexing this result must have been at the time. All other waves (water waves, sound waves, waves on a string) travel at a prescribed speed relative to the propagating medium (the stuff that does the waving), and if this medium is in motion with respect to the observer, the net speed is always greater “downstream” than “upstream.” Over the next 20 years, a series of improbable schemes were concocted in an effort to explain why this does not occur with light. Michelson and Morley themselves interpreted their experiment as confirmation of the “ether drag” hypothesis, which held that the Earth somehow pulls the ether along with it. But this was found to be inconsistent with other observations, notably the aberration of starlight.3 Various so-called “emission” theories were proposed, according to which the speed of electromagnetic waves is governed by the motion of 3 A discussion of the Michelson–Morley experiment and related matters is to be found in R. Resnick’s Introduction to Special Relativity, John Wiley, New York (1968), Chap. 1. 512 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity the source – as it would be in a corpuscular theory (conceiving of light as a stream of particles). Such theories called for implausible modifications in Maxwell’s equations, but in any event they were discredited by experiments using extraterrestrial light sources. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald and Lorentz suggested that the ether wind physically compresses all matter (including the Michelson–Morley apparatus itself) in just the right way to compensate for, and thereby conceal, the variation in speed with direction. As it turns out, there is a grain of truth in this, although their idea of the reason for the contraction was quite wrong. At any rate, it was not until Einstein that anyone took the Michelson– Morley result at face value, and suggested that the speed of light is a universal constant, the same in all directions, regardless of the motion of the observer or the source. There is no ether wind because there is no ether. Any inertial system is a suitable reference frame for the application of Maxwell’s equations, and the velocity of a charge is to be measured not with respect to a (nonexistent) absolute rest frame, nor with respect to a (nonexistent) ether, but simply with respect to the particular inertial system you happen to have chosen. Inspired, then, both by internal theoretical hints (the fact that the laws of electrodynamics are such as to give the right answer even when applied in the “wrong” system) and by external empirical evidence (the Michelson– Morley experiment4), Einstein proposed his two famous postulates: (1) The Principle of Relativity. The laws of physics apply in all inertial reference systems. (2) The Universal Speed of Light. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the source. The special theory of relativity is based on these two postulates. The first elevates Galileo’s observation about classical mechanics to the status of a general law, applying to all of physics. It states that there is no absolute rest system. The second might be considered Einstein’s response to the Michelson–Morley experiment. It means that there is no ether. (Some authors consider Einstein’s second postulate redundant – no more than a special case of the first. They maintain that the very existence of ether would violate the principle of relativity, in the sense that it would define a unique stationary reference frame. I think this is nonsense. The existence of air as a medium for sound does not invalidate the theory of relativity. Ether is no more an absolute rest system than the water in a goldfish bowl – which is a special system, if you happen to be the goldfish, but scarcely “absolute.” 5) 4 Actually, Einstein appears to have been only dimly aware of the Michelson–Morley experi- ment at the time. For him, the theoretical argument was decisive. 5 I put it this way in an effort to dispel some misunderstanding as to what constitutes an absolute rest frame. In 1977 it became possible to measure the speed of the Earth through the 3 K background radiation left over from the “big bang.” Does this mean we have found an absolute rest system, and relativity is out the window? Of course not. 513 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity Unlike the principle of relativity, which had roots going back several centuries, the universal speed of light was radically new – and, on the face of it, preposterous. For if I walk 5 mi/h down the corridor of a train going 60 mi/h, my net speed relative to the ground is “obviously” 65 mi/h – the speed of A (me) with respect to C (ground) is equal to the speed of A relative to B (train) plus the speed of B relative to C: vAC = vAB + vBC. (12.1) And yet, if A is a light signal (whether it comes from a flashlight on the train or a lamp on the ground or a star in the sky) Einstein would have us believe that its speed is c relative to the train and c relative to the ground: vAC = vAB = c. (12.2) Clearly, Eq. 12.1, which we now call Galileo’s velocity addition rule (no one before Einstein would have bothered to give it a name at all) is incompatible with the second postulate. In special relativity, as we shall see, it is replaced by Einstein’s velocity addition rule: vAC = vAB + vBC 1 + (vABvBC/c2) . (12.3) For “ordinary” speeds (vAB ≪ c and vBC ≪ c), the denominator is so close to 1 that the discrepancy between Galileo’s formula and Einstein’s formula is negligible. On the other hand, Einstein’s formula has the desired property that if vAB = c, then automatically vAC = c: vAC = c + vBC 1 + (cvBC/c2) = c. But how can Galileo’s rule, which seems to rely on nothing but common sense, possibly be wrong? And if it is wrong, what does this do to all of classical physics? The answer is that special relativity compels us to alter our notions of space and time themselves, and therefore also of such derived quantities as velocity, momentum, and energy. Although it developed historically out of Einstein’s contemplation of electrodynamics, the special theory is not limited to any particular class of phenomena – rather, it is a description of the space-time “arena” in which all physical phenomena take place. And in spite of the reference to the speed of light in the second postulate, relativity has nothing to do with light: c is a fundamental velocity, and it happens that light travels at that speed, but it is perfectly possible to conceive of a universe in which there are no electric charges, and hence no electromagnetic fields or waves (light), and yet relativity would still prevail. Because relativity defines the structure of space and time, it claims authority not merely over all presently known phenomena, but over those not yet discovered. It is, as Kant would say, a “prolegomenon to any future physics.” 514 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Problem 12.1. Let S be an inertial reference system. Use Galileo’s velocity addition rule. (a) Suppose that ¯S moves with constant velocity relative to S. Show that ¯S is also an inertial reference system. [Hint: Use the definition in footnote 1.] (b) Conversely, show that if ¯S is an inertial system, then it moves with respect to S at constant velocity. Problem 12.2. As an illustration of the principle of relativity in classical mechanics, consider the following generic collision: In inertial frame S, particle A (mass mA, velocity uA)hits particle B (mass mB, velocity uB). In the course of the collision some mass rubs off A and onto B, and we are left with particles C (mass mC, velocity uC)and D (mass mD, velocity uD). Assume that momentum (p ≡ mu) is conserved in S. (a) Prove that momentum is also conserved in inertial frame ¯S, which moves with velocity v relative to S. [Use Galileo’s velocity addition rule – this is an entirely classical calculation. What must you assume about mass?] (b) Suppose the collision is elastic in S; show that it is also elastic in ¯S. Problem 12.3. (a) What’s the percentage error introduced when you use Galileo’s rule, instead of Einstein’s, with vAB = 5 mi/h and vBC = 60 mi/h? (b) Suppose you could run at half the speed of light down the corridor of a train going three- quarters the speed of light. What would your speed be relative to the ground? (c) Prove, using Eq. 12.3,thatif vAB < c and vBC < c then vAC < c. Interpret this result. Fig. 12.3 Problem 12.4. As the outlaws escape in their getaway car, which goes 3 4 c, the police officer fires a bullet from the pursuit car, which only goes 1 2 c (Fig. 12.3). The muzzle velocity of the bullet (relative to the gun) is 1 3 c. Does the bullet reach its target (a) according to Galileo, (b) according to Einstein? 12.1.2 The Geometry of Relativity In this section I present a series of gedanken (thought) experiments that serve to introduce the three most striking geometrical consequences of Einstein’s postulates: time dilation, Lorentz contraction, and the relativity of simultaneity. In Section 12.1.3 the same results will be derived more systematically, using Lorentz transformations. 515 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity )a()b( Fig. 12.4 )a()b( Fig. 12.5 (i) The relativity of simultaneity. Imagine a freight car, traveling at constant speed along a smooth, straight track (Fig. 12.4). In the very center of the car there hangs a light bulb. When someone switches it on, the light spreads out in all directions at speed c. Because the lamp is equidistant from the two ends, an observer on the train will find that the light reaches the front end at the same instant as it reaches the back end: the two events in question – (a) light reaches the front end (and maybe a buzzer goes off) and (b) light reaches the back end (another buzzer sounds) – occur simultaneously. However, to an observer on the ground these same two events are not simultaneous. For as the light travels out from the bulb (going at speed c in both directions – that’s the second postulate), the train itself moves forward, so the beam going to the back end has a shorter distance to travel than the one going forward (Fig. 12.5). According to this observer, therefore, event (b) happens before event (a). An observer passing by on an express train, meanwhile, would report that (a) preceded (b). Conclusion: Two events that are simultaneous in one inertial system are not, in general, simultaneous in another. Naturally, the train has to be going awfully fast before the discrepancy becomes detectable – that’s why you don’t notice it all the time. Of course, it’s always possible for naïve witnesses to be mistaken about simultaneity: people sitting in the back corner of the car would hear buzzer b before buzzer a, simply because they’re closer to the source of the sound, and a child might infer that b actually rang before a. But this is a trivial error, having nothing to do with special relativity – obviously,you must correct for the time the signal (sound, light, carrier pigeon, or whatever) takes to reach you. When I speak of an observer, I mean someone with the sense to make this correction, and an observation is what is obtained after doing so. What you hear or see, therefore, is not the same as what you observe. An observation is an artificial reconstruction after the fact, when all the data are in, and it doesn’t depend on where the observer is located. In fact, a wise observer will avoid the whole problem by stationing assistants at strategic locations, each equipped with a watch synchronized to a master clock, so that time measurements can be made right at the scene. I belabor this point in order to emphasize that the relativity of simultaneity is a genuine discrepancy between measurements made by competent observers in relative motion, not a silly mistake arising from a failure to account for the travel time of light signals. 516 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Problem 12.5. Synchronized clocks are stationed at regular intervals, a million kilometers apart, along a straight line. The clock next to you reads 12 noon: (a) What time do you see on the 90th clock down the line? (b) What time do you observe on that clock? \bs To Earth b a v θ Fig. 12.6 Problem 12.6. Every 2 years, more or less, the New York Times publishes an article in which some astronomer claims to have found an object traveling faster than the speed of light. Many of these reports result from a failure to distinguish what is seen from what is observed –thatis, from a failure to account for light travel time. Here’s an example: A star is traveling with speed v at an angle θ to the line of sight (Fig. 12.6). What is its apparent speed across the sky? (Suppose the light signal from b reaches the Earth at a time Δt after the signal from a, and the star has meanwhile advanced a distance Δs across the celestial sphere; by “apparent speed,”I mean Δs/Δt.) What angle θ gives the maximum apparent speed? Show that the apparent speed can be much greater than c,evenif v itself is less than c. (ii) Time dilation. Now let’s consider a light ray that leaves the bulb and strikes the floor of the car directly below. Question: How long does it take the light to make this trip? From the point of view of an observer on the train, the answer is easy: if the height of the car is h, the time is Δ¯t = h c . (12.4) (I’ll use an overbar to denote measurements made on the train.) On the other hand, as observed from the ground, this same ray must travel farther, because the train itself is moving. From Fig. 12.7, I see that this distance is√h2 + (vΔt)2,so Δt = √ h2 + (vΔt)2 c . Solving for Δt,wehave Δt = h c 1 √ 1 − v2/c2 , 517 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity \bt h v Fig. 12.7 and therefore Δ¯t = √ 1 − v2/c2Δt. (12.5) Evidently, the time elapsed between the same two events – (a) light leaves bulb, and (b) light strikes center of floor – is different for the two observers. In fact, the interval recorded on the train clock, Δ¯t,is shorter by the factor γ ≡ 1 √1 − v2/c2 . (12.6) Conclusion: Moving clocks run slow. This is called time dilation. It doesn’t have anything to do with the mechanics of clocks; it’s a statement about the nature of time, and applies to all properly functioning timepieces. Of all Einstein’s predictions, none has received more spectacular and persuasive confirmation than time dilation. Most elementary particles are unstable: they disintegrate after a characteristic lifetime 6 that varies from one species to the next. The lifetime of a neutron is 15 min; of a muon, 2 × 10 −6 s; and of a neutral pion, 9 × 10 −17 s. But these are lifetimes of particles at rest. When particles are moving at speeds close to c they last much longer, for their internal clocks (whatever it is that tells them when their time is up) are running slow, in accordance with Einstein’s time dilation formula. Example 12.1. A muon is traveling through the laboratory at three- fifths the speed of light. How long does it last? Solution. In this case, γ = 1 √ 1 − (3/5)2 = 5 4 , so it lives longer (than at rest) by a factor of 5 4 : 5 4 × (2 × 10 −6) s = 2.5 × 10 −6 s. 6 Actually, an individual particle may last longer or shorter than this. Particle disintegration is a random process, and I should really speak of the average lifetime for the species. But to avoid irrelevant complication, I shall pretend that every particle disintegrates after precisely the average lifetime. 518 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity It may strike you that time dilation is inconsistent with the principle of relativity. For if the ground observer says the train clock runs slow, the train observer can with equal justice claim that the ground clock runs slow – after all, from the train’s point of view it is the ground that is in motion. Who’s right? Answer: They’re both right! On closer inspection, the “contradiction,” which seems so stark, evaporates. Let me explain: In order to check the rate of the train clock, the ground observer uses two of his own clocks (Fig. 12.8): one to compare times at the beginning of the interval, when the train clock passes point A, the other to compare times at the end of the interval, when the train clock passes point B. Of course, he must be careful to synchronize his clocks before the experiment. What he finds is that while the train clock ticked off, say, 3 minutes, the interval between his own two clock readings was 5 minutes. He concludes that the train clock runs slow. Meanwhile, the observer on the train is checking the rate of the ground clock by the same procedure: she uses two carefully synchronized train clocks, and compares times with a single ground clock as it passes by each of them in turn (Fig. 12.9). She finds that while the ground clock ticks off 3 minutes, the interval between her train clocks is 5 minutes, and concludes that the ground clock runs slow. Is there a contradiction? No, for the two observers have measured different things. The ground observer compared one train clock with two different ground clocks; the train observer compared one ground clock with two different train clocks. Each followed a sensible and correct procedure, comparing a single moving clock with two stationary ones. “So what,” you say, “the stationary clocks were synchronized in each instance, so it cannot matter that they used two different ones.” But there’s the rub: Clocks that are properly synchronized in one system will not be synchronized when observed from another system. They can’t be, for to say that two clocks are synchronized is to say that they read 12 noon simultaneously, and we have already learned that what’s simultaneous to one observer is not simultaneous to another. So whereas each observer conducted a perfectly sound measurement, from his/her own point of view, the other observer (watching the process) considers that she/he made the most elementary blunder in the book, by using two unsynchronized clocks. That’s how, in spite of the fact that his clocks “actually” run slow, he manages to conclude that hers are running slow (and vice versa). Train clock Ground clock A Ground clock B BA Train clock Ground clock A Ground clock B BA Fig. 12.8 Train clock B Ground clock Train clock A Fig. 12.9 519 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity Because moving clocks are not synchronized, it is essential when check- ing time dilation to focus attention on a single moving clock. All moving clocks run slow by the same factor, but you can’t start timing on one clock and then switch to another because they weren’t in step to begin with. But you can use as many stationary clocks (stationary with respect to you, the observer) as you please, for they are properly synchronized (moving observers would dispute this, but that’s their problem). Example 12.2. (The twin paradox) On her 21st birthday, an astronaut takes off in a rocket ship at a speed of 12 13 c. After 5 years have elapsed on her watch, she turns around and heads back at the same speed to rejoin her twin brother, who stayed at home. Question: How old is each twin at their reunion? Solution. The traveling twin has aged 10 years (5 years out, 5 years back); she arrives at home just in time to celebrate her 31st birthday. However, as viewed from the Earth, the moving clock has been running slow byafactor γ = 1 √ 1 − (12/13)2 = 13 5 . The time elapsed on earthbound clocks is 13 5 ×10 = 26, and her brother will be therefore celebrating his 47th birthday – he is now 16 years older than his twin sister! But don’t be deceived: This is no fountain of youth for the traveling twin; though she may die later than her brother, she will not have lived any more – she’s just done it slower. During the flight, all her biological processes – metabolism, pulse, thought, and speech – are subject to the same time dilation that affects her watch. The so-called twin paradox arises when you try to tell this story from the point of view of the traveling twin. She sees the Earth fly off at 12 13 c, turn around after 5 years, and return. From her point of view, it would seem, she’s at rest, whereas her brother is in motion, and hence it is he who should be younger at the reunion. An enormous amount has been written about the twin paradox, but the truth is there’s really no paradox here at all: this second analysis is simply wrong. The two twins are not equivalent. The traveling twin experiences acceleration when she turns around to head home, but her brother does not. To put it in fancier language, the traveling twin is not in an inertial system – more precisely, she’s in one inertial system on the way out and a completely different inertial system on the way back. You’ll see in Prob. 12.16 how to analyze this problem correctly from her perspective, but as far as the resolution of the “paradox” is concerned, it is enough to note that the traveling twin cannot claim to be a stationary observer because you can’t undergo acceleration and remain stationary. 520 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Problem 12.7. In a laboratory experiment, a muon is observed to travel 800 m before disin- tegrating. A graduate student looks up the lifetime of a muon (2 × 10−6 s) and concludes that its speed was v = 800 m 2 × 10−6 s = 4 × 10 8 m/s. Faster than light! Identify the student’s error, and find the actual speed of this muon. Problem 12.8. A rocket ship leaves Earth at a speed of 3 5 c. When a clock on the rocket says 1 hour has elapsed, the rocket ship sends a light signal back to Earth. (a) According to Earth clocks, when was the signal sent? (b) According to Earth clocks, how long after the rocket left did the signal arrive back on Earth? (c) According to the rocket observer, how long after the rocket left did the signal arrive back on Earth? (iii) Lorentz contraction. For the third gedanken experiment you must imagine that we have set up a lamp at one end of a boxcar and a mirror at the other, so that a light signal can be sent down and back (Fig. 12.10). Question: How long does the signal take to complete the round trip? To an observer on the train, the answer is Δ¯t = 2 Δ ¯x c , (12.7) where Δ ¯x is the length of the car (the overbar, as before, denotes measure- ments made on the train). To an observer on the ground, the process is more complicated because of the motion of the train. If Δt1 is the time for the light signal to reach the front end, and Δt2 is the return time, then (see Fig. 12.11) Δt1 = Δx + vΔt1 c , Δt2 = Δx − vΔt2 c , or, solving for Δt1 and Δt2, Δt1 = Δx c − v , Δt2 = Δx c + v . So the round-trip time is Δt = Δt1 + Δt2 = 2 Δx c 1 (1 − v2/c2) . (12.8) Lamp Mirror v Fig. 12.10 \bt1 \bt2vv v Fig. 12.11 521 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity But these intervals are related by the time dilation formula, Eq. 12.5: Δ¯t = √ 1 − v2/c2Δt. Applying this to Eqs. 12.7 and 12.8, I conclude that Δ ¯x = 1 √ 1 − v2/c2 Δx. (12.9) The length of the boxcar is not the same when measured by an observer on the ground, as it is when measured by an observer on the train – from the ground point of view, it is somewhat shorter. 7 Conclusion: Moving objects are shortened. We call this Lorentz contraction. Notice that the same factor, γ ≡ 1 √1 − v2/c2 , appears in both the time dilation formula and the Lorentz contraction formula. This makes it all very easy to remember: Moving clocks run slow, moving sticks are shortened, and the factor is always γ. Of course, the observer on the train doesn’t think her car is shortened – her meter sticks are contracted by that same factor, so all her measurements come out the same as when the train was standing in the station. In fact, from her point of view it is objects on the ground that are shortened. This raises again a seeming paradox: if A says B’s sticks are short, and B says A’s sticks are short, who is right? Answer: They both are! But to reconcile the rival claims we must study carefully the actual process by which length is measured. Suppose you want to measure the length of a snake. If it’s at rest (with respect to you) you simply lay your ruler down next to the snake, record the readings at each end, and subtract (Fig. 12.12). (If you’re really clever, you’ll line up the left end of the ruler with the tail of the snake – then you only have to read one number, and you can skip the subtraction.) But what if the snake is moving? Same story, only this time, of course, you must be careful to read the two ends at the same instant of time. If you don’t, the snake will move in the course of measurement, and obviously you’ll get the wrong answer. But therein lies the problem: because of the relativity Snake Ruler Fig. 12.12 7 Notice that I did not say it “appears” shorter, or it “seems” shorter, or it “looks” shorter. No, no, no! It is shorter, by any sensible definition of the term. 522 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity of simultaneity the two observers disagree on what constitutes “the same instant of time.” When the person on the ground measures the length of the boxcar, he reads the position of the two ends at the same instant in his system. But the person on the train, watching him do it, complains that he read the front end first, then waited a moment before reading the back end. Naturally, he came out short, in spite of the fact that (to her) he was using an undersized meter stick, which would otherwise have yielded a number too large. Both observers measure lengths correctly (from the point of view of their respective inertial frames), and each finds the other’s sticks to be shortened. Yet there is no inconsistency, for they are measuring different things, and each considers the other’s method improper. Example 12.3. (The barn and ladder paradox) Unlike time dilation, there is no direct experimental confirmation of Lorentz contraction, for the simple reason that it’s tough to get an object of measurable size going anywhere near the speed of light. The following parable illustrates how bizarre the world would be if the speed of light were more accessible. There once was a farmer who had a ladder too long to fit in his barn (Fig. 12.13a). He chanced one day to read some relativity, and a solu- tion to his problem suggested itself. He instructed his daughter to run with the ladder as fast as she could – the moving ladder having Lorentz- contracted to a size the barn could easily accommodate, she was to rush through the door, whereupon the farmer would slam it behind her, capturing the ladder inside (Fig. 12.13b). The daughter, however, has read somewhat further in the relativity book; she points out that in her reference frame the barn, not the ladder, will contract, and the fit will be even worse than it was with the two at rest (Fig. 12.13c). Question: Who’s right? Will the ladder fit inside the barn, or won’t it? Solution. They’re both right! When you say “the ladder is in the barn,” you mean that all parts of it are inside at one instant of time, but in view of the relativity of simultaneity, that’s a condition that depends on the observer. There are really two relevant events here: (a) (c) (b) Fig. 12.13 523 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity a: Back end of ladder makes it in the door. b: Front end of ladder hits far wall of barn. The farmer says a occurs before b,sothere is a time when the ladder is entirely inside the barn; his daughter says b precedes a, so there is not. Contradiction? Nope – just a difference in perspective. “But come now” (I hear you protest), “when it’s all over and the dust clears, either the ladder is inside the barn, or it isn’t. There can be no dispute about that.” Quite so, but now you’re introducing a new element into the story: What happens as the ladder is brought to a stop? Suppose the farmer grabs the last rung of the ladder firmly with one hand, while he slams the door with the other. Assuming it remains intact, the ladder must now stretch out to its rest length. Evidently, the front end keeps going, even after the rear end has stopped! Expanding like an accordion, the front end of the ladder smashes into the far side of the barn. In truth, the whole notion of a “rigid” object loses its meaning in relativity, for when it changes its speed, different parts do not in general accelerate simultaneously – in this way, the material stretches or shrinks to reach the length appropriate to its new velocity. 8 But to return to the question at hand, when the ladder finally comes to a stop, is it inside the barn or not? The answer is indeterminate. When the front end of the ladder hits the far side of the barn, something has to give, and the farmer is left either with a broken ladder inside the barn or with the ladder intact poking through a hole in the wall. In any event, he is unlikely to be pleased with the outcome. One final comment on Lorentz contraction. A moving object is short- ened only along the direction of its motion: Dimensions perpendicular to the velocity are not contracted. Indeed, in deriving the time dilation formula I took it for granted that the height of the train is the same for both observers. I’ll now justify this, using a lovely gedanken experiment suggested by Taylor and Wheeler. 9 Imagine that we build a wall beside the railroad tracks, and 1 m above the rails (as measured on the ground), we paint a horizontal blue line. When the train goes by, a passenger leans out the window holding a wet paintbrush 1 m above the rails, as measured on the train, leaving a horizontal red line on the wall. Question: Does the passenger’s red line lie above or below our blue one? If the rule were that perpendicular directions contract, then the person on the ground would predict that the red line is lower, while the person on the train would say it’s the blue one (to the latter, of course, the ground is moving). The principle of relativity says that both 8 For a related paradox see E. Pierce, Am.J.Phys. 75, 610 (2007). 9 E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics, 2nd ed., W. H. Freeman, San Francisco (1992). A somewhat different version of the same argument is given in J. H. Smith, Introduction to Special Relativity, Stipes, Champaign, IL (1965). 524 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity observers are equally justified, but they cannot both be right. No subtleties of simultaneity or synchronization can rationalize this contradiction; either the blue line is higher or the red one is – unless they exactly coincide, which is the inescapable conclusion. There cannot be a law of contraction (or expansion) of perpendicular dimensions, for it would lead to irreconcilably inconsistent predictions. Problem 12.9. A Lincoln Continental is twice as long as a VW Beetle, when they are at rest. As the Continental overtakes the VW, going through a speed trap, a (stationary) policeman observes that they both have the same length. The VW is going at half the speed of light. How fast is the Lincoln going? (Leave your answer as a multiple of c.) Problem 12.10. A sailboat is manufactured so that the mast leans at an angle ¯θ with respect to the deck. An observer standing on a dock sees the boat go by at speed v (Fig. 12.14). What angledoesthisobserversay themastmakes? v θ Fig. 12.14 R w Fig. 12.15 ! Problem 12.11. A record turntable of radius R rotates at angular velocity ω (Fig. 12.15). The circumference is presumably Lorentz-contracted, but the radius (being perpendicular to the velocity) is not. What’s the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, in terms of ω and R? According to the rules of ordinary geometry, it has to be π. What’s going on here?10 12.1.3 The Lorentz Transformations Any physical process consists of one or more events. An “event” is some- thing that takes place at a specific location (x, y, z), at a precise time (t). The explosion of a firecracker, for example, is an event; a tour of Europe is not. Suppose we know the coordinates (x, y, z, t) of a particular event E in one inertial system S, and we would like to calculate the coordinates 10 This is known as Ehrenfest’s paradox; for discussion and references, see H. Arzelies, Relativistic Kinematics, Pergamon Press, Elmsford, NY (1966), Chap. IX, or T. A. Weber, Am.J.Phys. 65, 486 (1997). 525 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity x y x x d v vt y E z A z Fig. 12.16 ( ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t) of that same event in some other inertial system ¯S. What we need is a “dictionary” for translating from the language of S to the language of ¯S. We may as well orient our axes as shown in Fig. 12.16, so that ¯S slides along the x-axis at speed v. If we “start the clock” (t = 0) at the moment the origins (O and ¯O) coincide, then at time t, ¯O will be a distance vt from O, and hence x = d + vt, (12.10) where d is the distance from ¯O to ¯A at time t ( ¯A is the point on the ¯x-axis that is even with E when the event occurs). Before Einstein, anyone would have said immediately that d = ¯x, (12.11) and thus constructed the “dictionary” (i) ¯x = x − vt, (ii) ¯y = y, (iii) ¯z = z, (iv) ¯t = t. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (12.12) These are now called the Galilean transformations, though they scarcely deserve so fine a title – the last one, in particular, went without saying, since everyone assumed the flow of time is the same for all observers. In the context of special relativity, however, we must expect (iv) to be replaced by a rule that incorporates time dilation, the relativity of simultaneity, and the nonsynchronization of moving clocks. Likewise, there will be a modification in (i) to account for Lorentz contraction. As for (ii) and (iii), they, at least, remain unchanged, for we have already seen that there can be no modification of lengths perpendicular to the motion. But where does the classical derivation of (i) break down? Answer: In Eq. 12.11.For d is the distance from ¯O to ¯Aasmeasuredin S,whereas ¯x is the distance from ¯O to ¯Aasmeasuredin ¯S. Because ¯O and ¯A are at rest in ¯S, ¯x is the “moving stick,” which is contracted as observed in S: 526 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity x d x y x vt y v E z A z ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ Fig. 12.17 d = 1 γ ¯x. (12.13) When this is inserted in Eq. 12.10 we obtain the relativistic version of (i): ¯x = γ(x − vt). (12.14) Of course, we could have run the same argument from the point of view of ¯S. The diagram (Fig. 12.17) looks similar, but in this case it depicts the scene at time ¯t,whereas Fig. 12.16 showed the scene at time t. (Note that t and ¯t represent the same physical instant at E, but not elsewhere, because of the relativity of simultaneity.) If we assume that ¯S also starts its clock when the origins coincide, then at time ¯t, O will be a distance v¯t from ¯O,and therefore ¯x = ¯d − v¯t, (12.15) where ¯d is the distance from O to A at time ¯t,and A is that point on the x- axis that is even with E when the event occurs. The classical physicist would have said that x = ¯d, and, using (iv), recovered (i). But, as before, relativity demands that we observe a subtle distinction: x is the distance from O to Ain S,whereas ¯d is the distance from O to Ain ¯S. Because O and A are at rest in S, x is the “moving stick,” and ¯d = 1 γ x. (12.16) It follows that x = γ( ¯x + v¯t). (12.17) This last equation comes as no surprise, for the symmetry of the situation dictates that the formula for x,interms of ¯x and ¯t, should be identical to the formula for ¯x in terms of x and t (Eq. 12.14), except for a switch in the sign of v.(If ¯S is going to the right at speed v, with respect to S, then S is going to the left at speed v, with respect to ¯S.) Nevertheless, this is a useful result, for if we substitute ¯x from Eq. 12.14, and solve for ¯t, we complete the relativistic “dictionary”: 527 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity (i) ¯x = γ(x − vt), (ii) ¯y = y, (iii) ¯z = z, (iv) ¯t = γ (t − v c2 x). (12.18) These are the famous Lorentz transformations, with which Einstein replaced the Galilean ones. They contain all the geometrical information in the special theory, as the following examples illustrate. The reverse dictio- nary, which carries you from ¯S back to S, can be obtained algebraically by solving (i) and (iv) for x and t, or, more simply, by switching the sign of v: (i′) x = γ( ¯x + v¯t), (ii′) y = ¯y, (iii′) z = ¯z, (iv′) t = γ (¯t + v c2 ¯x). ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (12.19) Example 12.4. (Simultaneity, synchronization, and time dilation) Sup- pose event A occurs at xA = 0, tA = 0, and event B occurs at xB = b, tB = 0. The two events are simultaneous in S (they both take place at t = 0). But they are not simultaneous in ¯S, for the Lorentz transformations give ¯xA = 0, ¯tA = 0and ¯xB = γb, ¯tB = −γ(v/c2)b. According to the ¯S clocks, then, B occurred before A. This is nothing new, of course – just the relativity of simultaneity. But I wanted you to see how it follows from the Lorentz transformations. Suppose that at time t = 0 observer S decides to examine all the clocks in ¯S. He finds that they read different times, depending on their location; from (iv), ¯t = −γ v c2 x. Those to the left of the origin (negative x)are ahead, and those to the right are behind, by an amount that increases in proportion to their distance (Fig. 12.18). Only the master clock at the origin reads ¯t = 0. Thus, the nonsynchronization of moving clocks, too, follows directly from the Lorentz transformations. Of course, from the ¯S viewpoint it is the S clocks that are out of synchronization, as you can check by putting ¯t = 0 into (iv′). Finally, suppose S focuses his attention on a single clock at rest in the ¯S frame (say, the one at ¯x = a), and watches it over some interval Δt. How much time elapses on the moving clock? Because ¯x is fixed, (iv′)gives Δt = γΔ¯t,or Δ¯t = 1 γ Δt. 528 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity x = 0 x = 0 clocks clocks v ¯ ¯ Fig. 12.18 That’s the old time dilation formula, derived now from the Lorentz transformations. Please note that it’s ¯x we hold fixed, here, because we’re watching one moving clock. If you hold x fixed, then you’re watching a whole series of different ¯S clocks as they pass by, and that won’t tell you whether any one of them is running slow. Example 12.5. (Lorentz contraction) Imagine a stick at rest in ¯S (hence moving to the right at speed v in S). Its rest length (that is, its length as measured in ¯S) is Δ ¯x = ¯xr − ¯xl, where the subscripts denote the right and left ends of the stick. If an observer in S were to measure the stick, he would subtract the positions of the two ends at one instant of his time t: Δx = xr − xl (for tl = tr). According to (i), then, Δx = 1 γ Δ ¯x. This is the old Lorentz contraction formula. Note that it’s t we hold fixed, here, because we’re talking about a measurement made by S,and he marks off the two ends at the same instant of his time ( ¯S doesn’t have to be so fussy, since the stick is at rest in her frame). Example 12.6. (Einstein’s velocity addition rule) Suppose a particle moves a distance dx (in S) in a time dt. Its velocity u is then u = dx dt . In ¯S, meanwhile, it has moved a distance d ¯x = γ(dx − vdt) (as we see from (i)), in a time given by (iv): d¯t = γ (dt − v c2 dx). The velocity in ¯S is therefore ¯u = d ¯x d¯t = γ(dx − vdt) γ(dt − v/c2 dx) = (dx/dt − v) 1 − v/c2 dx/dt = u − v 1 − uv/c2 . (12.20) 529 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity This is Einstein’s velocity addition rule. To recover the more transparent notation of Eq. 12.3,let A be the particle, B be S,and C be ¯S; then u = vAB, ¯u = vAC,and v = vCB = −vBC,so Eq. 12.20 becomes vAC = vAB + vBC 1 + (vABvBC/c2) . Problem 12.12. Solve Eqs. 12.18 for x, y, z, t in terms of ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t, and check that you recover Eqs. 12.19. Problem 12.13. Sophie Zabar, clairvoyant, cried out in pain at precisely the instant her twin brother, 500 km away, hit his thumb with a hammer. A skeptical scientist observed both events (brother’s accident, Sophie’s cry) from an airplane traveling at 12 13 c to the right (Fig. 12.19). Which event occurred first, according to the scientist? How much earlier was it, in seconds? Problem 12.14. (a) In Ex. 12.6 we found how velocities in the x direction transform when you go from S to ¯S. Derive the analogous formulas for velocities in the y and z directions. (b) A spotlight is mounted on a boat so that its beam makes an angle ¯θ with the deck (Fig. 12.20).

[The twin paradox revisited] On their 21st birthday, one twin gets on a moving sidewalk, which carries her out to star X at speed 4 5 c; her twin brother stays at home. When the traveling twin gets to star X, she immediately jumps onto the returning moving sidewalk and comes back to Earth, again at speed 4 5 c. She arrives on her 39th birthday (as determined by her watch). (a) How old is her twin brother? (b) How far away is star X? (Give your answer in light years.) Call the outbound sidewalk system ¯S and the inbound one ˜S (the Earth system is S). All three systems choose their coordinates and set their master clocks such that x = ¯x = ˜x = 0, t = ¯t = ˜t = 0 at the moment of departure. (c) What are the coordinates (x, t) of the jump (from outbound to inbound sidewalk) in S? (d) What are the coordinates ( ¯x, ¯t) of the jump in ¯S? (e) What are the coordinates ( ˜x, ˜t) of the jump in ˜S? (f) If the traveling twin wants her watch to agree with the clock in ˜S, how must she reset it immediately after the jump? What does her watch then read when she gets home? (This wouldn’t change her age,ofcourse–she’sstill 39 – it would just make her watch agree with the standard synchronization in ˜S.) (g) If the traveling twin is asked the question, “How old is your brother right now?”, what is the correct reply (i) just before she makes the jump, and (ii) just after she makes the jump? (Nothing dramatic happens to her brother during the split second between (i) and (ii), of course; what does change abruptly is his sister’s notion of what “right now, back home” means.)

Compare your answer to (a). 12.1.4 The Structure of Space-Time (i) Four-vectors. The Lorentz transformations take on a simpler appearance when expressed in terms of the quantities x0 ≡ ct, β ≡ v c . (12.21) Using x 0 (instead of t)and β (instead of v) amounts to changing the unit of time from the second to the meter: 1 meter of x0 corresponds to the time it takes light to travel 1 meter (in vacuum). If, at the same time, we number the x, y, z coordinates, so that x 1 = x, x 2 = y, x 3 = z, (12.22) then the Lorentz transformations read ¯x 0 = γ(x0 − βx1), ¯x 1 = γ(x1 − βx0), ¯x 2 = x 2, ¯x 3 = x 3, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (12.23) 531 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity or, in matrix form, \u0003\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0005 ¯x 0 ¯x 1 ¯x 2 ¯x 3 \u0006\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \b = \u0003\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0005 γ −γβ 00 −γβ γ 00 00 1 0 00 0 1 \u0006\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \b \u0003\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0005 x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 \u0006\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \b . (12.24) Letting Greek indices run from 0 to 3, this can be distilled into a single equation: ¯xμ = 3∑ ν=0 (Λμ ν )xν, (12.25) where Λ is the Lorentz transformation matrix in Eq. 12.24 (the superscript μ labels the row, the subscript ν labels the column). One virtue of writing things in this abstract manner is that we can handle in the same format a more general transformation, in which the relative motion is not along a common x ¯x-axis; the matrix Λ would be more complicated, but the structure of Eq. 12.25 is unchanged. If this reminds you of the rotations we studied in Section 1.1.5,it’sno accident. There we were concerned with the change in components when youswitchtoa rotated coordinate system; here we are interested in the change of components when you go to a moving system. In Chapter 1 we defined a (3-)vector as any set of three components that transform under rotations the same way (x, y, z) do; by extension, we now define a 4-vector as any set of four components that transform in the same manner as (x 0, x1, x 2, x 3) under Lorentz transformations: ¯aμ = 3∑ ν=0 Λμ ν aν. (12.26) For the particular case of a transformation along the x-axis, ¯a0 = γ(a 0 − βa 1), ¯a1 = γ(a 1 − βa 0), ¯a2 = a 2, ¯a3 = a 3. ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (12.27) There is a 4-vector analog to the dot product (A · B ≡ AxBx + AyBy + AzBz), but it’s not just the sum of the products of like components; rather, the zeroth components have a minus sign: − a 0b 0 + a 1b 1 + a 2b 2 + a 3b 3. (12.28) This is the four-dimensional scalar product; you should check for yourself (Prob. 12.17) that it has the same value in all inertial systems: − ¯a0 ¯b0 + ¯a 1 ¯b 1 + ¯a2 ¯b2 + ¯a 3 ¯b 3 = −a 0b 0 + a 1b 1 + a 2b 2 + a 3b 3; (12.29) 532 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity just as the ordinary dot product is invariant (unchanged) under rotations, this combination is invariant under Lorentz transformations.11 To keep track of the minus sign, it is convenient to introduce the covariant vector aμ, which differs from the contravariant aμ only in the sign of the zeroth component: aμ = (a0, a1, a2, a3) ≡ (−a 0, a 1, a 2, a 3). (12.30) You must be scrupulously careful about the placement of indices in this business: upper indices designate contravariant vectors; lower indices are for covariant vectors. Raising or lowering the temporal index costs a minus sign (a0 = −a 0); raising or lowering a spatial index changes nothing (a1 = a 1, a2 = a 2, a3 = a 3). Formally, aμ = 3∑ ν=0 gμνaν,where gμν ≡ \u0003\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0005 −1000 01 0 0 00 1 0 00 0 1 \u0006\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \b (12.31) is the (Minkowski) metric. 12 The scalar product can now be written with the summation symbol, 3∑ μ=0 aμbμ, or, more compactly still, aμbμ. (12.32) (Summation is implied whenever a Greek index is repeated in a product – once as a covariant index and once as contravariant. This is called the Einstein summation convention, after its inventor, who regarded it as one of his most important contributions.) Of course, we could just as well take care of the minus sign by switching to covariant b: aμbμ = aμbμ = −a 0b 0 + a 1b 1 + a 2b 2 + a 3b 3. (12.33) • Problem 12.17. Check Eq. 12.29, using Eq. 12.27. [This only proves the invariance of the scalar product for transformations along the x direction. But the scalar product is also invariant under rotations, since the first term is not affected at all, and the last three constitute the three- dimensional dot product a · b. By a suitable rotation, the x direction can be aimed any way you please, so the four-dimensional scalar product is actually invariant under arbitrary Lorentz transformations.] 11 In relativity, a scalar is a quantity that is invariant under Lorentz transformations as well as rotations. 12 It doesn’t matter whether you define the scalar product as in Eq. 12.28 (−a0b0 + a · b) or with an overall minus sign (a0b0 − a · b); if one is invariant, so is the other. In the literature, both conventions are common, and you just have to be aware of which one is in use. If they write the diagonal components of the Minkowski metric as (−, +, +, +), they are using the convention in Eq. 12.28; otherwise they will write (+, −, −, −). 533 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity Problem 12.18.

More significantly, rapidities add, whereas velocities do not. (b) Express the Einstein velocity addition law in terms of rapidity. (ii) The invariant interval. The scalar product of a 4-vector with itself, aμaμ = −(a 0)2 + (a 1)2 + (a 2)2 + (a 3)2, can be positive (if the “spatial” terms dominate) or negative (if the “temporal” term dominates) or zero: If aμaμ > 0, aμ is called spacelike. If aμaμ < 0, aμ is called timelike. If aμaμ = 0, aμ is called lightlike. Suppose event A occurs at (x 0 A, x1 A, x 2 A, x3 A), and event B at (x 0 B, x 1 B, x2 B, x3 B). The difference, Δxμ ≡ xμ A − xμ B, (12.35) is the displacement 4-vector. The scalar product of Δxμ with itself is called the invariant interval between two events: I ≡ (Δx)μ (Δx)μ = −(Δx0)2 + (Δx1)2 + (Δx2)2 + (Δx3)2 = −c2t2 +d2, (12.36) where t is the time difference between the two events and d is their spatial separation. When you transform to a moving system, the time between A and B is altered (¯t \u0002 t), andsoisthe spatial separation ( ¯d \u0002 d), but the interval I remains the same. If the displacement between two events is timelike (I < 0), there exists an inertial system (accessible by Lorentz transformation) in which they occur 13 E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics, 1st ed., W. H. Freeman, San Francisco (1966). 534 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity at the same point. For if I hop on a train going from A to B at the speed v = d/t, leaving event A when it occurs, I shall be just in time to pass B when it occurs; in the train system, A and B take place at the same point. You cannot do this for a spacelike interval, of course, because v would have to be greater than c, and no observer can exceed the speed of light (γ would be imaginary and the Lorentz transformations would be nonsense). On the other hand, if the displacement is spacelike (I > 0), then there exists a system in which the two events occur at the same time (see Prob. 12.21). And if the displacement is lightlike (I = 0), then the two events could be connected by a light signal. Problem 12.20. (a) Event A happens at point (xA = 5, yA = 3, zA = 0) and at time tA given by ctA = 15;event B occurs at (10, 8, 0) and ctB = 5,bothinsystem S. (i) What is the invariant interval between A and B? (ii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur simultaneously? If so, find its velocity (magnitude and direction) relative to S. (iii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur at the same point? If so, find its velocity relative to S. (b) Repeat part (a) for A = (2, 0, 0), ct = 1;and for B = (5, 0, 0), ct = 3. Problem 12.21. The coordinates of event A are (xA,0,0), tA, and the coordinates of event B are (xB,0,0), tB. Assuming the displacement between them is spacelike, find the velocity of the system in which they are simultaneous. (iii) Space-time diagrams. If you want to represent the motion of a particle graphically, the normal practice is to plot the position versus time (that is, x runs vertically and t horizontally). On such a graph, the velocity can be read off as the slope of the curve. For some reason, the convention is reversed in relativity: everyone plots position horizontally and time (or, better, x 0 = ct) vertically. Velocity is then given by the reciprocal of the slope. A particle at rest is represented by a vertical line; a photon, traveling at the speed of light, is described by a 45 ◦ line; and a rocket going at some intermediate speed follows a line of slope c/v = 1/β (Fig. 12.21). We call such plots Minkowski diagrams. The trajectory of a particle on a Minkowski diagram is called its world line. Suppose you set out from the origin at time t = 0. Because no material object can travel faster than light, your world line can never have a slope less than 1. Accordingly, your motion is restricted to the wedge-shaped region bounded by the two 45 ◦ lines (Fig. 12.22). We call this your “future,” in the sense that it is the locus of all points accessible to you. Of course, as time goes on, and you move along your chosen world line, your options 535 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity Particle at rest PhotonRocket ct x Fig. 12.21 Your future at t Your future, at t = 0 Your past, at t = 0 Present Present Your world line Fig. 12.22 progressively narrow: your “future” at any moment is the forward “wedge” constructed at whatever point you find yourself. Meanwhile, the backward wedge represents your “past”; it is the locus of all points from which you might have come. As for the rest (the region outside the forward and backward wedges), this is the generalized “present.” You can’t get there, and you didn’t come from there. In fact, there’s no way you can influence any event in the present (the message would have to travel faster than light); it’s a vast expanse of space-time that is absolutely inaccessible to you. I’ve been ignoring the y and z directions. If we include a y-axis coming out of the page, the “wedges” become cones – and, with an undrawable z-axis, hyper-cones. Because their boundaries are the trajectories of light rays, we call them the forward light cone and the backward light cone. Your future, in other words, lies within your forward light cone, your past within your backward light cone. Notice that the slope of the line connecting two events on a space-time diagram tells you at a glance whether the displacement between them is timelike (slope greater than 1), spacelike (slope less than 1), or lightlike (slope 1). For example, all points in the past and future are timelike with respect to your present location, whereas points in the present are spacelike, and points on the light cone are lightlike. Hermann Minkowski, who was the first to recognize the full geometrical significance of special relativity, began a famous lecture in 1908 with the words “Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.” 14 It’s a lovely thought, but you must be careful not to read too much into it. For it is not at all the case that time is “just another coordinate, on the same footing with x, y,and z” (except that 14 A. Einstein et al., The Principle of Relativity, Dover, New York (1923), Chap. V. Minkowski had been Einstein’s mathematics professor, and he did not initially have a high regard for his former student: “Oh, that Einstein, always cutting lectures …, I really would not have believed him capable of it.” Quoted by D. Overbye, Einstein in Love, Viking, New York (2000), p. 158. 536 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity r P x y Fig. 12.23 (a) ct (b) ct Fig. 12.24 for obscure reasons we measure it on clocks instead of rulers). No: Time is utterly different from the others, and the mark of its distinction is the minus sign in the invariant interval. That minus sign imparts to space-time a hyperbolic geometry that is much richer than the circular geometry of 3-space. Under rotations about the z-axis, a point P in the xy plane describes a circle: the locus of all points a fixed distance r = √ x2 + y2 from the origin (Fig. 12.23). Under Lorentz transformations, however, it is the interval I = (x 2 − c2t2) that is preserved, and the locus of all points with a given value of I is a hyperbola – or, if we include the y-axis, a hyperboloid of revolution. When the displacement is timelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of two sheets” (Fig. 12.24a); when the displacement is spacelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of one sheet” (Fig. 12.24b). When you perform a Lorentz transformation (that is, when you go into a moving inertial system), the coordinates (x, t) of a given event will change to ( ¯x, ¯t), but these new coordinates will lie on the same hyperbola as (x, t). By appropriate combinations of Lorentz transformations and rotations, a spot can be moved around at will over the surface of a given hyperboloid, but no amount of transformation will carry it, say, from the upper sheet of the timelike hyperboloid to the lower sheet, or to a spacelike hyperboloid. 537 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity When we were discussing simultaneity, I showed that the time ordering of two events can, at least in certain cases, be reversed, simply by going into a moving system. But we now see that this is not always possible: if the displacement 4-vector between two events is timelike, their ordering is absolute; if the interval is spacelike, their ordering depends on the inertial system from which they are observed. In terms of the space-time diagram, an event on the upper sheet of a timelike hyperboloid definitely occurred after (0, 0), and one on the lower sheet certainly occurred before; but an event on a spacelike hyperboloid occurred at positive t,ornegative t, depending on your reference frame. This is not an idle curiosity; it rescues the notion of causality, on which all physics is based. If it were always possible to reverse the order of two events, then we could never say “A caused B,” since a rival observer would retort that B preceded A. This embarrassment is avoided, provided the two events are timelike or lightlike separated. And causally related events are – otherwise no influence could travel from one to the other. Conclusion: The displacement between causally related events is always timelike, and their temporal ordering is the same for all inertial observers. Problem 12.22. (a) Draw a space-time diagram representing a game of catch (or a conversation) between two people at rest, 10 ft apart. How is it possible for them to communicate, given that their separation is spacelike? (b) There’s an old limerick that runs as follows: There once was a girl named Ms Bright, Who could travel much faster than light. She departed one day, The Einsteinian way, And returned on the previous night. What do you think? Even if she could travel faster than light, could she return before she set out? Could she arrive at some intermediate destination before she set out? Draw a space-time diagram representing this trip. Problem 12.23. Inertial system ¯S moves in the x direction at speed 3 5 c relative to system S. (The ¯x-axis slides long the x-axis, and the origins coincide at t = ¯t = 0,asusual.) (a) On graph paper set up a Cartesian coordinate system with axes ct and x. Carefully draw in lines representing ¯x = −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2,and 3. Also draw in the lines corresponding to c¯t = −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2,and 3. Label your lines clearly. (b) In ¯S, a free particle is observed to travel from the point ¯x = −2 at time c¯t = −2 to the point ¯x = 2 at c¯t =+3. Indicate this displacement on your graph. From the slope of this line, determine the particle’s speed in S. (c) Use the velocity addition rule to determine the velocity in S algebraically, and check that your answer is consistent with the graphical solution in (b). 538 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 12.2.1 Proper Time and Proper Velocity As you progress along your world line, your watch runs slow; while the clock on the wall ticks off an interval dt, your watch only advances dτ: dτ = √ 1 − u2/c2 dt. (12.37) (I’ll use u for the velocity of a particular object – you, in this instance – and reserve v for the relative velocity of two inertial systems.) The time τ your watch registers (or, more generally, the time associated with the moving object) is called proper time. (The word suggests a mistranslation of the French “propre,” meaning “own.”) In some cases, τ may be a more relevant or useful quantity than t. For one thing, proper time is invariant, whereas “ordinary” time depends on the particular reference frame you have in mind. Now, imagine you’re on a flight to Los Angeles, and the pilot announces that the plane’s velocity is 4 5 c. What precisely does he mean by “velocity”? Well, of course, he means the displacement divided by the time: u = dl dt , (12.38) and, since he is presumably talking about the velocity relative to ground, both dl and dt are to be measured by the ground observer. That’s the important number to know, if you’re concerned about getting there on time for your appointment, but if you’re wondering whether you’ll be hungry on arrival, you might be more interested in the distance covered per unit proper time: η ≡ dl dτ . (12.39) This hybrid quantity (distance measured on the ground, over time measured in the airplane) is called proper velocity; for contrast, I’ll call u the ordinary velocity. The two are related by Eq. 12.37: η = 1 √ 1 − u2/c2 u. (12.40) For speeds much less than c, of course, the difference between ordinary and proper velocity is negligible. From a theoretical standpoint, however, proper velocity has an enor- mous advantage over ordinary velocity: it transforms simply, when you go from one inertial system to another. In fact, η is the spatial part of a 4- vector, ημ ≡ dxμ dτ , (12.41) 539 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics whose zeroth component is η0 = dx 0 dτ = c dt dτ = c √ 1 − u2/c2 . (12.42) The numerator, dxμ, is a 4-vector, while the denominator, dτ, is invariant. Thus, for instance, when you go from system S to system ¯S, moving at speed v along the common x ¯x-axis, ¯η0 = γ(η0 − βη1), ¯η1 = γ(η1 − βη0), ¯η2 = η2, ¯η3 = η3, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (β = v c , γ = 1 √ 1 − β2 ). (12.43) More generally, ¯ημ = Λμ ν ην; (12.44) ημ is called the proper velocity 4-vector, or simply the 4-velocity. By contrast, the transformation rule for ordinary velocities is quite cumbersome, as we found in Ex. 12.6 and Prob. 12.14: ¯ux = d ¯x d¯t = ux − v (1 − vux/c2) , ¯uy = d ¯y d¯t = uy γ(1 − vux/c2) , ¯uz = d ¯z d¯t = uz γ(1 − vux/c2) , ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (12.45) or, more compactly, ¯u ∥ = u ∥ − v (1 − u ∥v/c2) , ¯u⊥ = u⊥ γ(1 − u ∥v/c2) (12.46) (where ∥ denotes the component parallel to the relative motion (v), and ⊥ denotes components perpendicular to v). The reason for the added complexity is plain: we’re obliged to transform both the numerator dl and the denominator dt, whereas for proper velocity, the denominator dτ is invariant, so the ratio inherits the transformation rule of the numerator alone. Problem 12.24. (a) Equation 12.40 defines proper velocity in terms of ordinary velocity. Invert that equation to get the formula for u in terms of η. (b) What is the relation between proper velocity and rapidity (Eq. 12.34)? Assume the velocity is along the x direction, and find η as a function of θ. Problem 12.25. A car is traveling along the 45◦ line in S (Fig. 12.25), at (ordinary) speed (2/ √5)c. 540 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity x y 45° 2 5 c Fig. 12.25 (a) Find the components ux and uy of the (ordinary) velocity. (b) Find the components ηx and ηy of the proper velocity. (c) Find the zeroth component of the 4-velocity, η0. System ¯S is moving in the x direction with (ordinary) speed √2/5c, relative to S. By using the appropriate transformation laws: (d) find the (ordinary) velocity components ¯ux and ¯uy in ¯S; (e) find the proper velocity components ¯ηx and ¯ηy in ¯S;and (f) as a consistency check, verify that ¯η = ¯u √ 1 − ¯u2/c2 . • Problem 12.26. Find the invariant product of the 4-velocity with itself, ημημ.Is ημ timelike, spacelike, or lightlike? Problem 12.27. A police officer pulls you over and asks what speed you were going. “Well, officer, I cannot tell a lie: the speedometer read 4 × 108 m/s.” You get a ticket, because the speed limit on this highway is 2.5 × 108 m/s. In court, your lawyer (who, luckily, has studied physics) points out that a car’s speedometer measures proper velocity, whereas the speed limit is ordinary velocity. Guilty, or innocent? Problem 12.28. Consider a particle in hyperbolic motion, x(t) = √ b2 + (ct)2, y = z = 0. (a) Find the proper time τ as a function of t, assuming the clocks are set so that τ = 0 when t = 0.[Hint: Integrate Eq. 12.37.] (b) Find x and u = dx/dt (ordinary velocity) as functions of τ. (c) Find ημ (proper velocity) as a function of τ. 12.2.2 Relativistic Energy and Momentum In classical mechanics, momentum is mass times velocity. I would like to extend this definition to the relativistic domain, but immediately a question arises: Should I use ordinary velocity or proper velocity? In classical physics, η and u are identical, so there is no a priori reason to favor one over the other. However, in the context of relativity it is essential that we use proper 541 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics velocity, for the law of conservation of momentum would be inconsistent with the principle of relativity if we were to define momentum as mu (see Prob. 12.29). Thus p ≡ mη = mu √ 1 − u2/c2 ; (12.47) this is the relativistic momentum of an object of mass m traveling at (ordinary) velocity u. 15 Relativistic momentum is the spatial part of a 4-vector, pμ ≡ mημ, (12.48) and it is natural to ask what the temporal component, p 0 = mη0 = mc √ 1 − u2/c2 , (12.49) represents. Einstein identified p 0c as relativistic energy: E ≡ mc2 √ 1 − u2/c2 ; (12.50) pμ is called the energy–momentum 4-vector (or the momentum 4-vector,for short). Notice that the relativistic energy is nonzero even when the object is stationary; we call this rest energy: Erest ≡ mc2. (12.51) The remainder, which is attributable to the motion,is kinetic energy, Ekin ≡ E − mc2 = mc2 ( 1 √1 − u2/c2 − 1). (12.52) In the nonrelativistic régime (u ≪ c) the square root can be expanded in powers of u 2/c2, giving Ekin = 1 2 mu 2 + 3 8 mu 4 c2 + ··· ; (12.53) the leading term reproduces the classical formula. So far, this is all just notation.The physics resides in the experimental fact that E and p,asdefinedby Eqs. 12.47 and 12.50,are conserved: In every isolated 16 system, the total relativistic energy and momentum are conserved. Mass is not conserved – a fact that has been painfully familiar to everyone since 1945 (though the so-called “conversion of mass into energy” is really a conversion of rest energy into kinetic energy). 15 Older treatments introduce the so-called relativistic mass, mr ≡ m/√ 1 − u2/c2,so p can be written as mru, but this unhelpful extra terminology has gone the way of the two-dollar bill. 16 If there are external forces at work, then (just as in the classical case) the energy and momentum of the system itself will not, in general, be conserved. 542 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Note the distinction between an invariant quantity (same value in all inertial systems) and a conserved quantity (same value before and after some process). Mass is invariant but not conserved; energy is conserved but not invariant; electric charge is both conserved and invariant; velocity is neither conserved nor invariant. The scalar product of pμ with itself is pμpμ = −(p 0)2 + (p · p) = −m 2c2, (12.54) as you can quickly check using the result of Prob. 12.26. In terms of the relativistic energy and momentum, E2 − p 2c2 = m 2c4. (12.55) This result is extremely useful, for it enables you to calculate E (if you know p ≡|p|),or p (knowing E), without ever having to determine the velocity. 17 Problem 12.29. (a) Repeat Prob. 12.2a using the (incorrect) definition p = mu, but with the (correct) Einstein velocity addition rule. Notice that if momentum (so defined) is conserved in S,itis not conserved in ¯S. Assume all motion is along the x-axis. (b) Now do the same using the correct definition, p = mη. Notice that if momentum (so defined) is conserved in S, it is automatically also conserved in ¯S.[Hint: Use Eq. 12.43 to transform the proper velocity.] What must you assume about relativistic energy? Problem 12.30. If a particle’s kinetic energy is n times its rest energy, what is its speed? Problem 12.31. Suppose you have a collection of particles, all moving in the x direction, with energies E1, E2, E3, ... and momenta p1, p2, p3, ... . Find the velocity of the center of momentum frame, in which the total momentum is zero. 12.2.3 Relativistic Kinematics In this section we’ll explore some applications of the conservation laws. Example 12.7. Two lumps of clay, each of (rest) mass m, collide head- on at 3 5 c (Fig. 12.26). They stick together. Question: What is the mass (M) of the composite lump? 17 Equations 12.54 and 12.55 apply to a single particle of mass m. If you’re talking about the total energy and momentum of a collection of particles, pμpμ is still an invariant, and you can use it to define the so-called invariant mass (−pμpμ/c2) of the system, but this will not (in general) be the sum of the individual masses. 543 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 3/5 c m M 3/5 c m (Before) (After) Fig. 12.26 Solution. In this case conservation of momentum is trivial: zero before, zero after. The energy of each lump prior to the collision is mc2 √ 1 − (3/5)2 = 5 4 mc2, and the energy of the composite lump after the collision is Mc 2 (since it’s at rest). So conservation of energy says 5 4 mc2 + 5 4 mc2 = Mc2, and hence M = 5 2 m. Notice that this is greater than the sum of the initial masses! Mass was not conserved in this collision; kinetic energy was converted into rest energy, so the mass increased. In the classical analysis of such a collision, we say that kinetic energy was converted into thermal energy – the composite lump is hotter than the two colliding pieces. This is, of course, true in the relativistic picture too. But what is thermal energy? It’s the sum total of the random kinetic and potential energies of all the atoms and molecules in the substance. Relativity tells us that these internal ener- gies are reflected in the mass of the composite object: a hot potato is heavier than a cold potato, and a compressed spring is heavier than a relaxed spring. Not by much, it’s true – internal energy (U) contributes an amount U/c 2 to the mass, and c2 is a very large number by everyday standards. You could never get two lumps of clay going anywhere near fast enough to detect the nonconservation of mass in their collision. But in the realm of elementary particles, the effect can be very striking. For example, when the neutral pi meson (mass 2.4 × 10 −28 kg) decays into an electron and a positron (each of mass 9.11 × 10 −31 kg), the rest energy is converted almost entirely into kinetic energy – less than 1 percent of the original mass remains. In classical mechanics, there’s no such thing as a massless (m = 0) parti- cle – its kinetic energy ( 1 2 mu 2) and its momentum (mu) would be zero, you couldn’t apply a force to it (F = ma), and hence (by Newton’s third law) it couldn’t exert a force on anything else – it’s a cipher, as far as physics is concerned. You might at first assume that the same is true in relativity; after all, p and E are still proportional to m. However, a closer inspection of Eqs. 12.47 and 12.50 reveals a loophole worthy of a congressman: if u = c, 544 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity then the zero in the numerator is balanced by a zero in the denominator, leaving p and E indeterminate (zero over zero). It is just conceivable, therefore, that a massless particle could carry energy and momentum, provided it always travels at the speed of light. Although Eqs. 12.47 and 12.50 would no longer suffice to determine E and p, Eq. 12.55 suggests that the two should be related by E = pc. (12.56) Personally, I would regard this argument as a joke, were it not for the fact that at least one massless particle is known to exist in nature: the photon. 18 Photons do travel at the speed of light, and they obey Eq. 12.56.19 They force us to take the “loophole” seriously. (By the way, you might ask what distinguishes a photon with a lot of energy from one with very little – after all, they have the same mass (zero) and the same speed (c). Relativity offers no answer to this question; curiously, quantum mechanics does: According to the Planck formula, E = hν,where h is Planck’s constant and ν is the frequency. A blue photon is more energetic than a red one!) Example 12.8. A pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino (Fig. 12.27). Find the energy of the outgoing muon, in terms of the two masses, mπ and mμ (assume mν = 0). Solution. In this case, Ebefore = mπc2, pbefore = 0, Eafter = Eμ + Eν, pafter = pμ + pν. Conservation of momentum requires that pν = − pμ. Conservation of energy says that Eμ + Eν = mπc2. Now, Eν = |pν |c,by Eq. 12.56,whereas |pμ | = √ E2 μ − m 2 μc4/c,by Eq. 12.55,so Eμ + √ E2 μ − m 2 μc4 = mπc2, (Before) (After) π μ ν Fig. 12.27 18 Until fairly recently, neutrinos were also assumed to be massless, but experiments in 1998 indicate that they in fact carry a (very small) mass. 19 The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic field, and it is no accident that the same ratio between energy and momentum holds for electromagnetic waves (see Eqs. 9.61 and 9.63). 545 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics from which it follows that Eμ = (m 2 π + m 2 μ)c2 2mπ . In a classical collision, momentum and mass are always conserved, whereas kinetic energy, in general, is not. A “sticky” collision generates heat at the expense of kinetic energy; an “explosive” collision generates kinetic energy at the expense of chemical energy (or some other kind). If the kinetic energy is conserved, as in the ideal collision of the two billiard balls, we call the process “elastic.” In the relativistic case, momentum and total energy are always conserved, but mass and kinetic energy, in general, are not. Once again, we call the process elastic if kinetic energy is conserved. In such a case the rest energy (being the total minus the kinetic) is also conserved, and therefore so too is the mass. In practice, this means that the same particles come out as went in. Examples 12.7 and 12.8 were inelastic processes; the next one is elastic. Example 12.9. (Compton scattering) A photon of energy E0 “bounces” off an electron, initially at rest. Find the energy E of the outgoing photon, as a function of the scattering angle θ (see Fig. 12.28). Solution. Conservation of momentum in the “vertical” direction gives pe sin φ = pp sin θ, or, since pp = E/c, sin φ = E pec sin θ. Conservation of momentum in the “horizontal” direction gives E0 c = pp cos θ + pe cos φ = E c cos θ + pe √ 1 − ( E pec sin θ) 2, or p 2 ec2 = (E0 − E cos θ)2 + E2 sin2 θ = E2 0 − 2E0E cos θ + E2. (Before) Electron E0 Photon (After) E Electron Photon θ φ Fig. 12.28 546 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity Finally, conservation of energy says that E0 + mc2 = E + Ee = E + √m2c4 + p 2 ec2 = E + √m2c4 + E2 0 − 2E0E cos θ + E2. Solving for E, I find that E = 1 (1 − cos θ)/mc2 + (1/E0) . (12.57) The answer looks nicer when expressed in terms of photon wavelength: E = hν = hc λ , so λ = λ0 + h mc (1 − cos θ). (12.58) The quantity (h/mc) is called the Compton wavelength of the electron. Problem 12.32. Find the velocity of the muon in Ex. 12.8. Problem 12.33. A particle of mass m whose total energy is twice its rest energy collides with an identical particle at rest. If they stick together, what is the mass of the resulting composite particle? What is its velocity? Problem 12.34. A neutral pion of (rest) mass m and (relativistic) momentum p = 3 4 mc decays into two photons. Suppose one of the photons is emitted in the same direction as the original pion, and the other in the opposite direction. Find the (relativistic) energy of each photon. E Target E E (b)(a) Fig. 12.29 Problem 12.35. In the past, most experiments in particle physics involved stationary targets: one particle (usually a proton or an electron) was accelerated to a high energy E, and collided with a target particle at rest (Fig. 12.29a). Far higher relative energies are obtainable (with the same accelerator) if you accelerate both particles to energy E, and fire them at each other (Fig. 12.29b). Classically, the energy ¯E of one particle, relative to the other, is just 4E (why?) … not much of a gain (only a factor of 4). But relativistically the gain can be enormous. Assuming the two particles have the same mass, m, show that ¯E = 2E2 mc2 − mc2. (12.59) 547 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics Suppose you use protons (mc2 = 1 GeV) with E = 30 GeV.What ¯E do you get? What multiple of E does this amount to? (1 GeV = 109 electron volts.) [Because of this relativis- tic enhancement, most modern elementary particle experiments involve colliding beams, instead of fixed targets.] Problem 12.36. In a pair annihilation experiment, an electron (mass m) with momentum pe hits a positron (same mass, but opposite charge) at rest. They annihilate, producing two photons. (Why couldn’t they produce just one photon?) If one of the photons emerges at 60◦ to the incident electron direction, what is its energy? 12.2.4 Relativistic Dynamics Newton’s first law is built into the principle of relativity. His second law, in the form F = dp dt , (12.60) retains its validity in relativistic mechanics, provided we use the relativistic momentum. Example 12.10. (Motion under a constant force) A particle of mass m is subject to a constant force F. If it starts from rest at the origin, at time t = 0, find its position (x), as a function of time. Solution. dp dt = F ⇒ p = Ft + constant, but since p = 0at t = 0, the constant must be zero, and hence p = mu √1 − u2/c2 = Ft. Solving for u, I find u = (F/m)t √ 1 + (Ft/mc)2 . (12.61) The numerator, of course, is the classical answer – it’s approximately right, if (F/m)t is much less than c. But the relativistic denominator ensures that u never exceeds c; in fact, as t →∞, u → c. To complete the problem we must integrate again: x(t) = F m ∫ t 0 t′ √1 + (Ft′/mc)2 dt′ = mc2 F √ 1 + (Ft′/mc)2||| t 0 = mc2 F [√ 1 + (Ft/mc)2 − 1]. (12.62) 548 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity ct x 45° Classical (parabola) Relativistic (hyperbola) Fig. 12.30 In place of the classical parabola, x(t) = (F/2m)t2,the graphisa hyperbola (Fig. 12.30); for this reason, motion under a constant force is called hyperbolic motion. It occurs, for example, when a charged particle is placed in a uniform electric field. Work, as always, is the line integral of the force: W ≡ ∫ F · dl. (12.63) The work–energy theorem (“the net work done on a particle equals the increase in its kinetic energy”) holds relativistically: W = ∫ dp dt · dl = ∫ dp dt · dl dt dt = ∫ dp dt · u dt, while dp dt · u = d dt ( mu √ 1 − u2/c2 ) · u = mu (1 − u2/c2)3/2 · du dt = d dt ( mc2 √1 − u2/c2 ) = dE dt , (12.64) so W = ∫ dE dt dt = Efinal − Einitial. (12.65) (Since the rest energy is constant, it doesn’t matter whether we use the total energy, here, or the kinetic energy.) Unlike the first two, Newton’s third law does not, in general, extend to the relativistic domain. Indeed, if the two objects in question are separated in space, the third law is incompatible with the relativity of simultaneity. For suppose the force of A on B at some instant t is F(t), and the force of B on A at the same instant is −F(t); then the third law applies in this reference 549 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics frame. But a moving observer will report that these equal and opposite forces occurred at different times; in this system, therefore, the third law is violated. Only in the case of contact interactions, where the two forces are applied at the same physical point (and in the trivial case where the forces are constant) does the third law hold. Because F is the derivative of momentum with respect to ordinary time, it shares the ugly behavior of (ordinary) velocity, when you go from one inertial system to another: both the numerator and the denominator must be transformed. Thus, 20 ¯F y = d ¯py d¯t = dpy γ dt − γβ c dx = dpy/dt γ (1 − β c dx dt ) = Fy γ(1 − βux/c) , (12.66) and similarly for the z component: ¯F z = Fz γ(1 − βux/c) . The x component is even worse: ¯F x = d ¯px d¯t = γ dpx − γβ dp 0 γ dt − γβ c dx = dpx dt − β dp 0 dt 1 − β c dx dt = Fx − β c ( dE dt ) 1 − βux/c . We calculated dE/dt in Eq. 12.64; putting that in, ¯F x = Fx − β(u · F)/c 1 − βux/c . (12.67) In one special case these equations are reasonably tractable: if the particle is (instantaneously) at rest in S, so that u = 0, then ¯F⊥ = 1 γ F⊥, ¯F ∥ = F ∥. (12.68) That is, the component of F parallel to the motion of ¯S is unchanged, whereas perpendicular components are divided by γ. It has perhaps occurred to you that we could avoid the bad trans- formation behavior of F by introducing a “proper” force, analogous to proper velocity, which would be the derivative of momentum with respect to proper time: K μ ≡ dpμ dτ . (12.69) This is called the Minkowski force; it is plainly a 4-vector, since pμ is a 4-vector and proper time is invariant. The spatial components of K μ are related to the “ordinary” force by K = ( dt dτ ) dp dt = 1 √1 − u2/c2 F, (12.70) 20 Remember: γ and β pertain to the motion of ¯S with respect S – they are constants; u is the velocity of the particle with respect to S. 550 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity while the zeroth component, K 0 = dp 0 dτ = 1 c dE dτ , (12.71) is, apart from the 1/c, the (proper) rate at which the energy of the particle increases – in other words, the (proper) power delivered to the particle. Relativistic dynamics can be formulated in terms of the ordinary force or in terms of the Minkowski force. The latter is generally much neater, but since in the long run we are interested in the particle’s trajectory as a function of ordinary time, the former is often more useful. When we wish to generalize some classical force law, such as Lorentz’s, to the relativistic domain, a question arises: Does the classical formula correspond to the ordinary force or to the Minkowski force? In other words, should we write F = q(E + u × B), or should it rather be K = q(E + u × B)? Since proper time and ordinary time are identical in classical physics, there is no way at this stage to decide the issue. The Lorentz force, as it turns out, is an ordinary force – later on I’ll explain why this is so, and show you how to construct the electromagnetic Minkowski force. Example 12.11. The typical trajectory of a charged particle in a uni- form magnetic field is cyclotron motion (Fig. 12.31). The magnetic force pointing toward the center, F = QuB, provides the centripetal acceleration necessary to sustain circular motion. Beware, however – in special relativity the centripetal force is not mu 2/R, as in classical mechanics. Rather, as you can see from Fig. 12.32, dp = pdθ,so F = dp dt = p dθ dt = p u R . R Q u B Fig. 12.31 dθ dθp + dp dp p + dpp p Fig. 12.32 551 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics (Classically, of course p = mu,so F = mu 2/R.) Thus, QuB = p u R , or p = QBR. (12.72) In this form, the relativistic cyclotron formula is identical to the nonrelativistic one, Eq. 5.3 – the only difference is that p is now the relativistic momentum. In classical mechanics, the total momentum (P) of a collection of interacting particles can be expressed as the total mass (M) times the velocity of the center of mass: P = M dRm dt . In relativity the center of mass (Rm = 1 M ∑ miri) is replaced by the center of energy (Re = 1 E ∑ Eiri,where E is the total energy), and M by E/c 2: P = E c2 dRe dt . (12.73) The quantity P now includes all forms of momentum, and E all forms of energy – not just mechanical, but also whatever may be stored in the fields. 21 In particular, if the center of energy is at rest, the total momentum of the system must be zero,22 as you would certainly expect. Example 12.12. In Ex. 8.3 we found that the momentum stored in the fields of a coaxial cable is not zero, even though the cable itself is at rest. At the time, this seemed paradoxical. However, energy is being transported, from the battery to the resistor, and hence the center of energy is in motion. Indeed, if the battery is at z = 0, so the resistor is at z = l, then Re = (E0R0 + ERlˆz)/E,where ER is the energy in the resistor, E0 is any energy not contained in the battery or the resistor, and R0 is the center of energy of E0,so dRe dt = (dER/dt)l E ˆz = IVl E ˆz. According to Eq. 12.73, then, the total momentum should be P = IVl c2 ˆz, which is exactly the momentum in the fields, as calculated in Ex. 8.3. If this still seems strange to you, imagine a shoebox, with a marble inside that we cannot see. The box is at rest, but the marble is rolling 21 The proof of Eq. 12.73 is not trivial. See S. Coleman and J. H. Van Vleck, Phys. Rev. 171, 1370 (1968) or M. G. Calkin, Am. J. Phys. 39, 513 (1971). 22 This is sometimes called the center-of-energy theorem. 552 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity from one end to the other. Is there momentum in this system? Yes, of course there is; even though the box is stationary, there’s still the momentum of the marble. In the case of the coaxial cable, no actual object is in motion (well, the electrons are, but there are just as many of them going one way as the other, and their net momentum is zero), but energy is flowing from one end to the other, and in relativity all forms of energy in motion, not just rest energy (mass), constitute momentum. The “marble” (in this analogy) is the electromagnetic field, which transports energy, and therefore contributes momentum … even though the fields themselves are perfectly static!23 In the following example, the center of energy is at rest, so the total momentum must be zero (Eq. 12.73). But the (static) electromagnetic fields do carry momentum, and the problem is to locate the compensating mechanical momentum. Example 12.13. As a model for a magnetic dipole m, consider a rect- angular loop of wire carrying a steady current I. Picture the current as a stream of noninteracting positive charges that move freely within the wire. When a uniform electric field E is applied (Fig. 12.33), the charges accelerate in the left segment and decelerate in the right one. 24 Find the total momentum of all the charges in the loop. Solution. The momenta of the left and right segments cancel, so we need only consider the top and the bottom. Say there are N+ charges in the top segment, going at speed u+ to the right, and N− charges in the lower segment, going at (slower) speed u− to the left. The current (I = λu) is the same in all four segments (or else charge would be piling up somewhere); in particular, u\u0002 w I I I I u\u0004 E l Fig. 12.33 23 This problem was incorrectly analyzed in the third edition – see T. H. Boyer, Am.J.Phys. 76, 190 (2008). 24 This is not a very realistic model for a current-carrying wire, obviously, but other models lead to exactly the same result. See V. Hnizdo, Am.J.Phys. 65, 92 (1997). 553 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics I = QN+ l u+ = QN− l u−,so N±u± = Il Q , where Q is the charge of each particle, and l is the length of the rectangle. Classically, the momentum of a single particle is p = Mu (where M is its mass), and the total momentum (to the right) is Pclassical = MN+u+ − MN−u− = M Il Q − M Il Q = 0, as one would certainly expect (after all, the loop as a whole is not moving). But relativistically, p = γMu, and we get p = γ+MN+u+ − γ−MN−u− = MIl Q (γ+ − γ−), which is not zero, because the particles in the upper segment are moving faster. In fact, the gain in energy (γMc 2), as a particle ascends the left segment, is equal to the work done by the electric force, QEw,where w is the height of the rectangle, so γ+ − γ− = QEw Mc2 , and hence p = IlEw c2 . But Ilw is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop; as vectors, m points into the page and p is to the right, so p = 1 c2 (m × E). (12.74) Thus a magnetic dipole at rest in an electric field carries linear momen- tum, even though it is not moving! This so-called hidden momentum is strictly relativistic, and purely mechanical; it precisely cancels the electromagnetic momentum stored in the fields (Eq. 8.45). 25 Problem 12.37. In classical mechanics, Newton’s law can be written in the more familiar form F = ma. The relativistic equation, F = dp/dt, cannot be so simply expressed. Show, rather, that F = m √1 − u2/c2 [a + u(u · a) c2 − u2 ], (12.75) where a ≡ du/dt is the ordinary acceleration. Problem 12.38. Show that it is possible to outrun a light ray, if you’re given a sufficient head start, and your feet generate a constant force. 25 This model is due to P. Penfield, Jr. and H. A. Haus, Electrodynamics of Moving Media, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (1967), pp. 214–216. For more on hidden momentum, look again at Prob. 8.8, and the reference cited there. 554 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity • Problem 12.39.

[Hint: Use Eq. 12.75.] Problem 12.42. Generalize the strategy of Ex. 12.13 to a stationary current loop of arbitrary shape in a static electric field that is not necessarily uniform, to show that the hidden momen- tum can be written as phid = − I c2 ∮ Vdl, where V is the scalar potential. For surface and volume currents this becomes phid = − 1 c2 ∫ V K da, phid = − 1 c2 ∫ V J dτ. (12.77) Compare Eq. 8.46, and comment. Problem 12.43. In Prob. 8.26 the center of energy was at rest, but the (static) fields carried momentum. Use Eq. 12.77 to calculate the hidden momentum in this configuration, and con- firm that it exactly balances the field momentum. What does this do to the conservation of momentum, which we painstakingly confirmed in parts (c), (d), and (e) of that problem? 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics 12.3.1 Magnetism as a Relativistic Phenomenon Unlike Newtonian mechanics, classical electrodynamics is already con- sistent with special relativity. Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force 555 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics law can be applied legitimately in any inertial system. Of course, what one observer interprets as an electrical process, another may regard as magnetic, but the actual particle motions they predict will be identical. To the extent that this did not work out for Lorentz and others, who studied the question in the late nineteenth century, the fault lay with the nonrelativis- tic mechanics they used, not with the electrodynamics. Having corrected Newtonian mechanics, we are now in a position to develop a complete and consistent formulation of relativistic electrodynamics. I emphasize that we will not be changing the rules of electrodynamics in the slightest – rather, we will be expressing these rules in a notation that exposes and illuminates their relativistic character. As we go along, I shall pause now and then to rederive, using the Lorentz transformations, results obtained earlier by more laborious means. But the main purpose of this section is to provide you with a deeper understanding of the structure of electrodynamics – laws that had seemed arbitrary and unrelated before, take on a kind of coherence and inevitability when approached from the point of view of relativity. To begin with, I’d like to show you why there had to be such a thing as magnetism, given electrostatics and relativity, and how, in particular, you can calculate the magnetic force between a current-carrying wire and a moving charge without ever invoking the laws of magnetism.26 Suppose you had a string of positive charges moving along to the right at speed v. I’ll assume the charges are close enough together so that we may treat them as a continuous line charge λ. Superimposed on this positive string is a negative one, −λ proceeding to the left at the same speed v.Wehave, then, a net current to the right, of magnitude I = 2λv. (12.78) Meanwhile, a distance s away there is a point charge q traveling to the right at speed u < v (Fig. 12.34a). Because the two line charges cancel, there is no electrical force on q in this system (S). However, let’s examine the same situation from the point of view of system ¯S, which moves to the right with speed u (Fig. 12.34b). In this reference frame, q is at rest. By the Einstein velocity addition rule, the velocities of the positive and negative lines are now v± = v ∓ u 1 ∓ vu/c2 . (12.79) Because v− is greater than v+, the Lorentz contraction of the spacing between negative charges is more pronounced than that between positive charges; in this frame, therefore, the wire carries a net negative charge! In fact, λ± = ±(γ±)λ0, (12.80) 26 This and several other arguments in this section are adapted from E. M. Purcell’s Electricity and Magnetism, 2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York (1985). 556 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity \u0002\u0002\u0002 (\u0002λ) (\u0004λ) \u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0004 \u0004\u0004 u v v v+ v– s q \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 \u0002\u0002(λ\u0002) (λ\u0004)\u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004 s q (a) (b) Fig. 12.34 where γ± = 1 √ 1 − v2 ±/c2 , (12.81) and λ0 is the charge density of the positive line in its own rest system. That’s not the same as λ, of course – in S they’re already moving at speed v,so λ = γλ0, (12.82) where γ = 1 √1 − v2/c2 . (12.83) It takes some algebra to put γ± into the simplest form: γ± = 1 √ 1 − 1 c2 (v ∓ u)2(1 ∓ vu/c2)−2 = c2 ∓ uv √(c2 ∓ uv)2 − c2(v ∓ u)2 = c2 ∓ uv √(c2 − v2)(c2 − u2) = γ 1 ∓ uv/c2 √ 1 − u2/c2 . (12.84) The net line charge in ¯S, then, is λtot = λ+ + λ− = λ0(γ+ − γ−) = −2λuv c2√ 1 − u2/c2 . (12.85) Conclusion: As a result of unequal Lorentz contraction of the positive and negative lines, a current-carrying wire that is electrically neutral in one inertial system will be charged in another. 557 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics Now, a line charge λtot sets up an electric field E = λtot 2πϵ0s , so there is an electrical force on q in ¯S, to wit, ¯F = qE = − λv πϵ0c2s qu √1 − u2/c2 . (12.86) But if there’s a force on q in ¯S, there must be one in S;infact,we can calculate it by using the transformation rules for forces. Since q is at rest in ¯S,and ¯F is perpendicular to u, the force in S is given by Eq. 12.68: F = √ 1 − u2/c2 ¯F = − λv πϵ0c2 qu s . (12.87) The charge is attracted toward the wire by a force that is purely electrical in ¯S (where the wire is charged, and q is at rest), but distinctly nonelectrical in S (where the wire is neutral). Taken together, then, electrostatics and relativity imply the existence of another force. This “other force” is, of course, magnetic.Infact, we cancast Eq. 12.87 into more familiar form by using c2 = (ϵ0μ0)−1 and expressing λv in terms of the current (Eq. 12.78): F = −qu( μ0I 2πs ). (12.88) The term in parentheses is the magnetic field of a long straight wire, and the force is precisely what we would have obtained by using the Lorentz force law in system S. 12.3.2 How the Fields Transform We have learned, in various special cases, that one observer’s electric field is another’s magnetic field. It would be nice to know the general transformation rules for electromagnetic fields: Given the fields in S, what are the fields in ¯S? Your first guess might be that E is the spatial part of one 4-vector and B the spatial part of another. But your guess would be wrong – it’s more complicated than that. Let me begin by making explicit an assumption that has already been used implicitly in Section 12.3.1: charge is invariant. Like mass, but unlike energy, the charge of a particle is a fixed number, independent of how fast it happens to be moving. We shall assume also that the transformation rules are the same no matter how the fields were produced – electric fields associated with changing magnetic fields transform the same way as those set up by stationary charges. Were this not the case we’d have to abandon the field formulation altogether, for it is the essence of a field theory that the fields at a given point tell you all there is to know, electromagnetically, about that point; you do not have to append extra information regarding their source. 558 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity y0 x0 l0 z0 –σ0 +σ0 y x l z –σ +σ (a) w v0 v0 w v v (b) (c) –σ +σ Fig. 12.35 With this in mind, consider the simplest possible electric field: the uniform field in the region between the plates of a large parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 12.35a). Say the capacitor is at rest in S0 and carries surface charges ±σ0. Then E0 = σ0 ϵ0 ˆy. (12.89) What if we examine this same capacitor from system S, moving to the right at speed v0 (Fig. 12.35b)? In this system the plates are moving to the left, but the field still takes the form E = σ ϵ0 ˆy; (12.90) the only difference is the value of the surface charge σ. [Wait a minute! Is that the only difference? The formula E = σ/ϵ0 for a parallel-plate capacitor came from Gauss’s law, and whereas Gauss’s law is perfectly valid for moving charges, this application also relies on symmetry. Are we sure that the field is still perpendicular to the plates? What if the field of a moving plane tilts, say, along the direction of motion, as in Fig. 12.35c? Well, even if it did (it doesn’t), the field between the plates, being the superposition of the +σ field and the −σ field, would still run perpendicular to the plates (changing the sign of the charge reverses the direction of the field, and the vector sum kills off the parallel components).] Now, the total charge on each plate is invariant, and the width (w)is unchanged, but the length (l) is Lorentz-contracted by a factor of γ0 = 1 √ 1 − v2 0/c2 , (12.91) 559 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics y x w l z d \u0002σ\u0004σ Fig. 12.36 so the charge per unit area is increased by a factor of γ0: σ = γ0σ0. (12.92) Accordingly, E ⊥ = γ0E ⊥ 0 . (12.93) I have put in the superscript ⊥ to make it clear that this rule pertains to components of E that are perpendicular to the direction of motion of S.To get the rule for parallel components, consider the capacitor lined up with the yz plane (Fig. 12.36). This time it is the plate separation (d) that is Lorentz- contracted, whereas l and w (and hence also σ) are the same in both frames. Since the field does not depend on d, it follows that E ∥ = E0 ∥. (12.94) Example 12.14. (Electric field of a point charge in uniform motion) A point charge q is at rest at the origin in system S0. Question: What is the electric field of this same charge in system S,whichmoves to the rightatspeed v0 relative to S0? Solution. In S0, the field is E0 = 1 4πϵ0 q r 2 0 ˆr0, or Ex0 = 1 4πϵ0 qx0 (x 2 0 + y 2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , Ey0 = 1 4πϵ0 qy0 (x 2 0 + y 2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , Ez0 = 1 4πϵ0 qz0 (x 2 0 + y 2 0 + z2 0)3/2 . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ 560 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity R P q v y x z 0 0tv θ Fig. 12.37 From the transformation rules (Eqs. 12.93 and 12.94), we have Ex = Ex0 = 1 4πϵ0 qx0 (x 2 0 + y 2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , Ey = γ0Ey0 = 1 4πϵ0 γ0qy0 (x 2 0 + y 2 0 + z2 0)3/2 , Ez = γ0Ez0 = 1 4πϵ0 γ0qz0 (x 2 0 + y 2 0 + z2 0)3/2 . ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ These are still expressed in terms of the S0 coordinates (x0, y0, z0) of the field point (P); I’d prefer to write them in terms of the S coordinates of P. From the Lorentz transformations (or, actually, the inverse transformations), x0 = γ0(x + v0t) = γ0Rx, y0 = y = Ry, z0 = z = Rz, ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ where R is the vector from q to P (Fig. 12.37). Thus E = 1 4πϵ0 γ0qR (γ2 0R2 cos2 θ + R2 sin2 θ)3/2 = 1 4πϵ0 q(1 − v2 0/c2) [1 − (v2 0/c2) sin2 θ]3/2 ˆR R2 . (12.95) This, then, is the field of a charge in uniform motion; we got the same result in Chapter 10 using the retarded potentials (Eq. 10.75). The present derivation is far more efficient, and sheds some light on the remarkable fact that the field points away from the instantaneous (as opposed to the retarded) position of the charge: Ex gets a factor of γ0 from the Lorentz transformation of the coordinates; Ey and Ez pick up theirs from the transformation of the field. It’s the balancing of these two γ0s that leaves E parallel to R. But Eqs. 12.93 and 12.94 are not the most general transformation laws, for we began with a system S0 in which the charges were at rest and where, consequently, there was no magnetic field. To derive the general rule, we 561 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics y0 x0 y vv v x y x 0 0 ( relative to )¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ Fig. 12.38 must start out in a system with both electric and magnetic fields. For this purpose S itself will serve nicely. In addition to the electric field Ey = σ ϵ0 , (12.96) there is a magnetic field due to the surface currents (Fig. 12.35b): K± = ∓σv0ˆx. (12.97) By the right-hand rule, this field points in the negative z direction; its magnitude is given by Ampère’s law (Ex. 5.8): Bz = −μ0σv0. (12.98) In a third system, ¯S, traveling to the right with speed v relative to S (Fig. 12.38), the fields would be ¯Ey = ¯σ ϵ0 , ¯Bz = −μ0 ¯σ¯v, (12.99) where ¯v is the velocity of ¯S relative to S0: ¯v = v + v0 1 + vv0/c2 , ¯γ = 1 √ 1 − ¯v2/c2 , (12.100) and ¯σ = ¯γσ0. (12.101) It remains only to express ¯E and ¯B (Eq. 12.99), in terms of E and B (Eqs. 12.96 and 12.98). In view of Eqs. 12.92 and 12.101,wehave ¯Ey = ( ¯γ γ0 ) σ ϵ0 , ¯Bz = −( ¯γ γ0 ) μ0σ¯v. (12.102) With a little algebra, you can show that ¯γ γ0 = √ 1 − v2 0/c2 √ 1 − ¯v2/c2 = 1 + vv0/c2 √ 1 − v2/c2 = γ (1 + vv0 c2 ), (12.103) where γ = 1 √1 − v2/c2 , (12.104) 562 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity y xv z \u0002σ \u0004σ Fig. 12.39 as always. Thus, writing ¯Ey in terms of the components of E and B in S, ¯Ey = γ (1 + vv0 c2 ) σ ϵ0 = γ (Ey − v c2ϵ0μ0 Bz), whereas ¯Bz = −γ (1 + vv0 c2 ) μ0σ ( v + v0 1 + vv0/c2 ) = γ(Bz − μ0ϵ0vEy). Or, since μ0ϵ0 = 1/c2, ¯Ey = γ(Ey − vBz), ¯Bz = γ (Bz − v c2 Ey). ⎫⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪ ⎭ (12.105) This tells us how Ey and Bz transform – to do Ez and By, we simply align the same capacitor parallel to the xy plane instead of the xz plane (Fig. 12.39). The fields in S are then Ez = σ ϵ0 , By = μ0σv0. (Use the right-hand rule to get the sign of By.) The rest of the argument is identical – everywhere we had Ey before, read Ez, and everywhere we had Bz,read −By: ¯Ez = γ(Ez + vBy), ¯By = γ (By + v c2 Ez). ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ (12.106) As for the x components, we have already seen (by orienting the capacitor parallel to the yz plane) that ¯Ex = Ex. (12.107) Since in this case there is no accompanying magnetic field, we cannot deduce the transformation rule for Bx. But another configuration will do 563 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics y z I x Fig. 12.40 the job: imagine a long solenoid aligned parallel to the x-axis (Fig. 12.40) andatrestin S. The magnetic field within the coil is Bx = μ0nI, (12.108) where n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current. In system ¯S, the length contracts, so n increases: ¯n = γn. (12.109) On the other hand, time dilates: the S clock, which rides along with the solenoid, runs slow, so the current (charge per unit time) in ¯S is given by ¯I = 1 γ I. (12.110) The two factors of γ exactly cancel, and we conclude that ¯Bx = Bx. Like E, the component of B parallel to the motion is unchanged. Here, then, is the complete set of transformation rules: ¯Ex = Ex, ¯Ey = γ(Ey − vBz), ¯Ez = γ(Ez + vBy), ¯Bx = Bx, ¯By = γ (By + v c2 Ez), ¯Bz = γ (Bz − v c2 Ey), (12.111) or, in the notation of Eq. 12.46, ¯E ∥ = E ∥, ¯E⊥ = γ(E⊥ + v × B⊥), ¯B ∥ = B ∥, ¯B⊥ = γ(B⊥ − v c2 × E⊥). (12.112) Two special cases warrant particular attention: (1) If B = 0 in S, then ¯B = γ v c2 (Ezˆy − Eyˆz) = v c2 ( ¯Ezˆy − ¯Eyˆz), or, since v = vˆx, ¯B = − 1 c2 (v × ¯E). (12.113) 564 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity (2) If E = 0 in S, then ¯E = −γv(Bzˆy − Byˆz) = −v( ¯Bzˆy − ¯Byˆz), or ¯E = v × ¯B. (12.114) In other words, if either E or B is zero (at a particular point) in one system, then in any other system the fields (at that point) are very simply related by Eq. 12.113 or Eq. 12.114. Example 12.15. (Magnetic field of a point charge in uniform motion) Find the magnetic field of a point charge q moving at constant velocity v. Solution. In the particle’s rest frame the magnetic field is zero (every- where), so in a system moving with velocity −v (in which the particle is moving at velocity +v)27 B = 1 c2 (v × E). We calculated the electric field in Ex. 12.14. The magnetic field, then, is B = μ0 4π qv(1 − v2/c2) sin θ [1 − (v2/c2) sin2 θ]3/2 ˆφ R2 , (12.115) where ˆφ aims counterclockwise as you face the oncoming charge. Incidentally, in the nonrelativistic limit (v 2 ≪ c2), Eq. 12.115 reduces to B ≈ μ0 4π q v × ˆR R2 , which is exactly what you would get by naïve application of the Biot– Savart law to a point charge (Eq. 5.43). Problem 12.44. Why can’t the electric field in Fig. 12.35b have a z component? After all, the magnetic field does. Problem 12.45. A point charge q is at rest at the origin in a uniform magnetic field B0ˆy.You walk by in the −x direction, at speed v (so that from your perspective the charge moves at velocity vˆx). Why isn’t it deflected by the magnetic field? Problem 12.46. In system S0, a static uniform line charge λ coincides with the z-axis. (a) Write the electric field E0 in Cartesian coordinates, for the point (x0, y0, z0). (b) Use Eq. 12.111 to find the electric field in S, which moves with speed v in the x direction with respect to S0. The field is still in terms of (x0, y0, z0); express it instead in terms 27 Here v is the particle’s velocity; in Eq. 12.113 it was the velocity of the reference frame. 565 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics of the coordinates (x, y, z) in S. Finally, write E in terms of the vector S from the present location of the wire and the angle θ between S and ˆx. Does the field point away from the instantaneous location of the wire, like the field of a uniformly moving point charge? Problem 12.47. (a) Charge qA is at rest at the origin in system S;charge qB flies by at speed v on a trajectory parallel to the x-axis, but at y = d. What is the electromagnetic force on qB as it crosses the y-axis? (b) Now study the same problem from system ¯S, which moves to the right with speed v.What is the force on qB when qA passes the ¯y-axis? [Do it two ways: (i) by using your answer to (a) and transforming the force; (ii) by computing the fields in ¯S and using the Lorentz force law.] Problem 12.48. Two charges, ±q, are on parallel trajectories a distance d apart, moving with equal speeds v in opposite directions. We’re interested in the force on +q due to −q at the instant they cross (Fig. 12.41). Fill in the following table, doing all the consistency checks you can think of as you go along.

An electromagnetic plane wave of (angular) frequency ω is traveling in the x direction through the vacuum. It is polarized in the y direction, and the amplitude of the electric field is E0.

Find the electric and magnetic fields in ¯S, and express them in terms of the ¯S coordinates: ¯E( ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t) and ¯B( ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯t) . [Again, be sure to define any auxiliary quantities you introduce.] (c) What is the frequency ¯ω ofthewavein ¯S? Interpret this result.

As a youth, Einstein wondered what an electromagnetic wave would look like if you could run along beside it at the speed of light. What can you tell him about the amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the wave, as v approaches c? Problem 12.51. Consider the following scenario: In the half-space x < 0 the electric and magnetic fields are zero; in the half-space x > 0 there is a uniform static magnetic field B = −B0ˆz (x > 0), but still no electric field. A point charge q (mass m) comes in from x = −∞,traveling at constant speed v along the x-axis. At time t = 0 it reaches the origin. (a) Describe (and sketch) its subsequent motion. (b) Analyze this same problem from the perspective of an inertial reference frame ¯S moving in the x direction at speed v. [Assume v is substantially less than c,soyou candropterms in v2/c2 (but not terms linear in v) – this just means that you can use nonrelativistic mechanics.] 12.3.3 The Field Tensor As Eq. 12.111 indicates, E and B certainly do not transform like the spatial parts of two 4-vectors – in fact, the components of E and B are stirred together when you go from one inertial system to another. What sort of an object is this, which has six components and transforms according to Eq. 12.111? Answer: It’s an antisymmetric, second-rank tensor. Remember that a 4-vector transforms by the rule ¯aμ = Λμ ν aν (12.116) (summation over ν implied), where Λ is the Lorentz transformation matrix. If ¯S is moving in the x direction at speed v, Λ has the form 567 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics Λ = \u0003\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0005 γ −γβ 00 −γβ γ 00 00 1 0 00 0 1 \u0006\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \b , (12.117) and Λμ ν is the entry in row μ, column ν. A (second-rank) tensor is an object with two indices, which transforms with two factors of Λ (one for each index): ¯tμν = Λμ λΛν σtλσ. (12.118) A tensor (in 4 dimensions) has 4×4 = 16 components, which we can display as a 4 × 4array: tμν = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ t00 t01 t02 t03 t10 t11 t12 t13 t20 t21 t22 t23 t30 t31 t32 t33 ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ . However, the 16 elements need not all be different. For instance, a symmetric tensor has the property tμν = tνμ (symmetric tensor). (12.119) In this case there are 10 distinct components; 6 of the 16 are repeats (t01 = t10, t02 = t20, t03 = t30, t12 = t21, t13 = t31, t23 = t32). Similarly, an antisymmetric tensor obeys tμν = −tνμ (antisymmetric tensor). (12.120) Such an object has just 6 distinct elements – of the original 16, 6 are repeats (the same ones as before, only this time with a minus sign) and 4 are zero (t00, t11, t22,and t33). Thus, the general antisymmetric tensor has the form tμν = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ 0 t01 t02 t03 −t01 0 t12 t13 −t02 −t12 0 t23 −t03 −t13 −t23 0 ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ . Let’s see how the transformation rule (Eq. 12.118) works, for the 6 distinct components of an antisymmetric tensor. Starting with ¯t01,wehave ¯t01 = Λ 0 λΛ 1 σtλσ, but according to Eq. 12.117, Λ 0 λ = 0 unless λ = 0or1,and Λ 1 σ = 0 unless σ = 0 or 1. So there are four terms in the sum: ¯t01 = Λ 0 0Λ 1 0t00 + Λ 0 0Λ 1 1t01 + Λ 0 1Λ 1 0t10 + Λ 0 1Λ 1 1t11. On the other hand, t00 = t11 = 0, while t01 = −t10,so ¯t 01 = (Λ 0 0Λ 1 1 − Λ 0 1Λ 1 0)t01 = (γ2 − (γβ)2)t01 = t01. 568 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity I’ll let you work out the others – the complete set of transformation rules is ¯t 01 = t01, ¯t02 = γ(t02 − βt12), ¯t 03 = γ(t03 + βt31), ¯t 23 = t23, ¯t31 = γ(t31 + βt03), ¯t 12 = γ(t12 − βt02). ⎫⎪⎬ ⎪ ⎭ (12.121) These are precisely the rules we obtained on physical grounds for the electromagnetic fields (Eq. 12.111) – in fact, we can construct the field tensor F μν by direct comparison: 28 F 01 ≡ Ex c , F 02 ≡ Ey c , F 03 ≡ Ez c , F 12 ≡ Bz, F 31 ≡ By, F 23 ≡ Bx. Writtenasanarray, F μν = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ 0 Ex/cEy/cEz/c −Ex/c 0 Bz −By −Ey/c −Bz 0 Bx −Ez/cBy −Bx 0 ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ . (12.122) Thus relativity completes and perfects the job begun by Oersted, combining the electric and magnetic fields into a single entity, F μν. If you followed that argument with exquisite care, you may have noticed that there was a different way of embedding E and B in an antisymmetric tensor: instead of comparing the first line of Eq. 12.111 with the first line of Eq. 12.121, and the second with the second, we could relate the first line of Eq. 12.111 to the second line of Eq. 12.121, and vice versa. This leads to dual tensor, Gμν: Gμν = ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩ 0 Bx By Bz −Bx 0 −Ez/cEy/c −By Ez/c 0 −Ex/c −Bz −Ey/cEx/c 0 ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎭ . (12.123) This Gμν can be obtained directly from F μν by the substitution E/c → B, B →−E/c. Notice that this operation leaves Eq. 12.111 unchanged – that’s why both tensors generate the correct transformation rules for E and B. Problem 12.52. Work out the remaining five parts to Eq. 12.121. Problem 12.53. Prove that the symmetry (or antisymmetry) of a tensor is preserved by Lorentz transformation (that is, if tμν is symmetric, show that ¯tμν is also symmetric, and likewise for antisymmetric). Problem 12.54. Recall that a covariant 4-vector is obtained from a contravariant one by changing the sign of the zeroth component. The same goes for tensors: when you “lower an 28 Some authors prefer the convention F 01 ≡ Ex, F 12 ≡ cBz, and so on, and some use the opposite signs. Accordingly, most of the equations from here on will look a little different, depending on the text. 569 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics index” to make it covariant, you change the sign if that index is zero. Compute the tensor invariants F μνFμν, GμνGμν, and F μνGμν, in terms of E and B.Compare Prob. 12.49. Problem 12.55. A straight wire along the z-axis carries a charge density λ traveling in the +z direction at speed v. Construct the field tensor and the dual tensor at the point (x,0,0). 12.3.4 Electrodynamics in Tensor Notation Now that we know how to represent the fields in relativistic notation, it is time to reformulate the laws of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law) in that language. To begin with, we must determine how the sources of the fields, ρ and J, transform. Imagine a cloud of charge drifting by; we concentrate on an infinitesimal volume V , which contains charge Q moving at velocity u (Fig. 12.42). The charge density is ρ = Q V , and the current density 29 is J = ρu. I would like to express these quantities in terms of the proper charge density ρ0, the density in the rest system of the charge: ρ0 = Q V0 , where V0 is the rest volume of the cloud. Because one dimension (the one along the direction of motion) is Lorentz-contracted, V = √ 1 − u2/c2V0, (12.124) V Q u Fig. 12.42 29 I’m assuming all the charge in V is of one sign, and it all goes at the same speed. If not, you have to treat the constituents separately (see Chapter 5, footnote 8), but the result is the same. 570 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity and hence ρ = ρ0 1 √ 1 − u2/c2 , J = ρ0 u √ 1 − u2/c2 . (12.125) Comparing this with Eqs. 12.40 and 12.42, we recognize here the compo- nents of proper velocity, multiplied by the invariant ρ0. Evidently, charge density and current density go together to make a 4-vector: J μ = ρ0ημ, (12.126) whose components are J μ = (cρ, Jx, Jy, Jz). (12.127) We’ll call it the current density 4-vector. The continuity equation (Eq. 5.29), ∇ · J = − ∂ρ ∂t , expressing the local conservation of charge, takes on a nice compact form when written in terms of J μ.For ∇ · J = ∂Jx ∂x + ∂Jy ∂y + ∂Jz ∂z = 3∑ i=1 ∂Ji ∂xi , while ∂ρ ∂t = 1 c ∂J0 ∂t = ∂J0 ∂x0 . (12.128) Thus, bringing ∂ρ/∂t over to the left-hand side (in the continuity equation), we have ∂J μ ∂xμ = 0, (12.129) with summation over μ implied. Incidentally, ∂J μ/∂xμ is the four- dimensional divergence of J μ, so the continuity equation states that the current density 4-vector is divergenceless. As for Maxwell’s equations, they can be written ∂F μν ∂xν = μ0J μ, ∂Gμν ∂xν = 0, (12.130) with summation over ν implied. Each of these stands for four equations – one for every value of μ.If μ = 0, the first equation reads ∂F 0ν ∂xν = ∂F 00 ∂x0 + ∂F 01 ∂x1 + ∂F 02 ∂x2 + ∂F 03 ∂x3 = 1 c ( ∂Ex ∂x + ∂Ey ∂y + ∂Ez ∂z ) = 1 c (∇ · E) = μ0J0 = μ0cρ, 571 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics or ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ. This, of course, is Gauss’s law. If μ = 1, we have ∂F 1ν ∂xν = ∂F 10 ∂x0 + ∂F 11 ∂x1 + ∂F 12 ∂x2 + ∂F 13 ∂x3 = − 1 c2 ∂Ex ∂t + ∂Bz ∂y − ∂By ∂z = (− 1 c2 ∂E ∂t + ∇ × B) x = μ0J1 = μ0Jx. Combining this with the corresponding results for μ = 2and μ = 3gives ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t , which is Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction. Meanwhile, the second equation in 12.130, with μ = 0, becomes ∂G0ν ∂xν = ∂G00 ∂x0 + ∂G01 ∂x1 + ∂G02 ∂x2 + ∂G03 ∂x3 = ∂Bx ∂x + ∂By ∂y + ∂Bz ∂z = ∇ · B = 0 (the third of Maxwell’s equations), whereas μ = 1 yields ∂G1ν ∂xν = ∂G10 ∂x0 + ∂G11 ∂x1 + ∂G12 ∂x2 + ∂G13 ∂x3 = − 1 c ∂Bx ∂t − 1 c ∂Ez ∂y + 1 c ∂Ey ∂z = − 1 c ( ∂B ∂t + ∇ × E) x = 0. So, combining this with the corresponding results for μ = 2and μ = 3, ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , which is Faraday’s law. In relativistic notation, then, Maxwell’s four rather cumbersome equations reduce to two delightfully simple ones. In terms of F μν and the proper velocity ημ, the Minkowski force on a charge q is given by K μ = qηνF μν. (12.131) For if μ = 1, we get K 1 = qηνF 1ν = q(−η0F 10 + η1F 11 + η2F 12 + η3F 13) = q[ −c √ 1 − u2/c2 ( −Ex c ) + uy √ 1 − u2/c2 (Bz) + uz √ 1 − u2/c2 (−By)] = q √ 1 − u2/c2 [E + (u × B)]x, with a similar formula for μ = 2and μ = 3. Thus, K = q √ 1 − u2/c2 [E + (u × B)], (12.132) 572 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity and therefore, referring back to Eq. 12.70, F = q[E + (u × B)], which is the Lorentz force law. Equation 12.131, then, represents the Lorentz force law in relativistic notation. I’ll leave for you the interpretation of the zeroth component (see Prob. 12.58). Problem 12.56. Obtain the continuity equation (Eq. 12.129) directly from Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 12.130). Problem 12.57. Show that the second equation in 12.130 can be expressed in terms of the field tensor F μν as follows: ∂Fμν ∂xλ + ∂Fνλ ∂xμ + ∂Fλμ ∂xν = 0. (12.133) Problem 12.58. Work out, and interpret physically, the μ = 0 component of the electromag- netic force law, Eq. 12.131. Problem 12.59. Maxwell’s equations are invariant under Lorentz transformations. That is, if they hold in S, ∇ · E = 1 ϵ0 ρ, ∇ · B = 0, ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t , ∇ × B = μ0J + μ0ϵ0 ∂E ∂t , then they automatically hold as well in ¯S: ¯∇ · ¯E = 1 ϵ0 ¯ρ, ¯∇ · ¯B = 0, ¯∇ × ¯E = − ∂ ¯B ∂¯t , ¯∇ × ¯B = μ0¯J + μ0ϵ0 ∂ ¯E ∂¯t . Prove it, using the transformation rules 12.111 and the fact that the current J μ = (cρ, Jx, Jy, Jz) is a 4-vector.30 [Hint: Note that ∂ ∂¯t = ∂t ∂¯t ∂ ∂t + ∂x ∂¯t ∂ ∂x + ∂y ∂¯t ∂ ∂y + ∂z ∂¯t ∂ ∂z = γ ( ∂ ∂t + v ∂ ∂x ), and similarly for the other derivatives.] 12.3.5 Relativistic Potentials From Chapter 10, we know that the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed in terms of a scalar potential V and a vector potential A: E = −∇V − ∂A ∂t , B = ∇ × A. (12.134) 30 Of course, you can do it much more efficiently using tensor notation – in fact, it is trivial given Eq. 12.130, since both sides transform the same way; part of the beauty of this language is that it makes consistency with relativity manifest visually. But the point of this problem is to see how it works out in the more familiar three-dimensional notation. 573 12.3 Relativistic Electrodynamics As you might guess, V and A together constitute a 4-vector: Aμ = (V /c, Ax, Ay, Az). (12.135) In terms of this 4-vector potential, the field tensor can be written F μν = ∂Aν ∂xμ − ∂Aμ ∂xν . (12.136) (Observe that the differentiation is with respect to the covariant vectors xμ and xν; remember, that changes the sign of the zeroth component: x0 = −x 0. See Prob. 12.60.) To check that Eq. 12.136 is equivalent to Eq. 12.134, let’s evaluate a few terms explicitly. For μ = 0, ν = 1, F 01 = ∂A1 ∂x0 − ∂A0 ∂x1 = − ∂Ax ∂(ct) − 1 c ∂V ∂x = − 1 c ( ∂A ∂t + ∇V ) x = Ex c . That (and its companions with ν = 2and ν = 3) is the first equation in Eq. 12.134.For μ = 1, ν = 2, we get F 12 = ∂A2 ∂x1 − ∂A1 ∂x2 = ∂Ay ∂x − ∂Ax ∂y = (∇ × A)z = Bz, which (together with the corresponding results for F 23 and F 31)isthe second equation in Eq. 12.134. The potential formulation automatically takes care of the homogeneous Maxwell equation (∂Gμν/∂xν = 0). As for the inhomogeneous equation (∂F μν/∂xv = μ0J μ), that becomes ∂ ∂xμ ( ∂Aν ∂xν ) − ∂ ∂xν ( ∂Aμ ∂xν ) = μ0J μ. (12.137) This is an intractable equation as it stands. However, you will recall that the potentials are not uniquely determined by the fields – in fact, it’s clear from Eq. 12.136 that you could add to Aμ the gradient of any scalar function λ: Aμ → Aμ′ = Aμ + ∂λ ∂xμ , (12.138) without changing F μν. This is precisely the gauge invariance we noted in Chapter 10; we can exploit it to simplify Eq. 12.137. In particular, the Lorenz gauge condition (Eq. 10.12) ∇· A = − 1 c2 ∂V ∂t becomes, in relativistic notation, ∂Aμ ∂xμ = 0. (12.139) 574 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity In the Lorenz gauge, therefore, Eq. 12.137 reduces to the inhomogeneous wave equation (10.16): □ 2Aμ = −μ0J μ, (12.140) where □ 2 is the d’Alembertian (10.15): □ 2 ≡ ∂ ∂xν ∂ ∂xν = ∇2 − 1 c2 ∂2 ∂t2 . (12.141) Equation 12.140 combines our previous results into a single 4-vector equa- tion – it represents the most elegant formulation of Maxwell’s equations. 31 Problem 12.60. You may have noticed that the four-dimensional gradient operator ∂/∂xμ functions like a covariant 4-vector – in fact, it is often written ∂μ, for short. For instance, the continuity equation, ∂μJ μ = 0, has the form of an invariant product of two vectors. The corresponding contravariant gradient would be ∂μ ≡ ∂/∂xμ. Prove that ∂μφ is a (contravariant) 4-vector, if φ is a scalar function, by working out its transformation law, usingthechainrule. Problem 12.61. Show that the potential representation (Eq. 12.136) automatically satisfies ∂Gμν/∂xν = 0.[Suggestion: Use Prob. 12.57.] Problem 12.62. Show that the Liénard–Wiechert potentials (Eqs. 10.46 and 10.47)can be expressed in relativistic notation as Aμ = − q 4πϵ0c ημ (ην ν ) , where μ ≡ xμ − wμ (tr).

To restore this condition, it is necessary to perform an appropriate gauge transformation every time you go to a new inertial system, in addition to the Lorentz transformation itself. In this sense, Aμ is not a true 4-vector, in the Coulomb gauge. 575 More Problems on Chapter 12 Problem 12.64.

Phys. 65, 1051 (1997). A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates A.1 Introduction In this appendix I sketch proofs of the three fundamental theorems of vector calculus. My aim is to convey the essence of the argument, not to track down every epsilon and delta. A much more elegant, modern, and unified – but necessarily also much longer – treatment will be found in M. Spivak’s book, Calculus on Manifolds, Benjamin, New York (1965). For the sake of generality, I shall use arbitrary (orthogonal) curvilinear coordinates (u, v, w), developing formulas for the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian in any such system. You can then specialize them to Cartesian, spherical, or cylindrical coordinates, or any other system you might wish to use. If the generality bothers you on a first reading, and you’d rather stick to Cartesian coordinates, just read (x, y, z) wherever you see (u, v, w), and make the associated simplifications as you go along. A.2 Notation We identify a point in space by its three coordinates, u, v,and w (in the Cartesian system, (x, y, z); in the spherical system, (r, θ, φ); and in the cylindrical system, (s, φ, z)). I shall assume the system is orthogonal,inthe sense that the three unit vectors, ˆu, ˆv,and ˆw, pointing in the direction of the increase of the corresponding coordinates, are mutually perpendicular. Note that the unit vectors are functions of position, since their directions (except in the Cartesian case) vary from point to point. Any vector can be expressed in terms of ˆu, ˆv,and ˆw – in particular, the infinitesimal displacement vector from (u, v, w) to (u+du, v+dv, w+dw) can be written as dl = fdu ˆu + gdv ˆv + hdw ˆw, (A.1) where f , g,and h are functions of position characteristic of the particular coordinate system (in Cartesian coordinates f = g = h = 1; in spherical coordinates f = 1, g = r, h = r sin θ; and in cylindrical coordinates f = h = 1, g = s). As you’ll soon see, these three functions tell you everything you need to know about a coordinate system. 579 A.3 Gradient A.3 Gradient If you move from point (u, v, w) to point (u + du, v + dv, w + dw), a scalar function t(u, v, w) changes by an amount dt = ∂t ∂u du + ∂t ∂v dv + ∂t ∂w dw; (A.2) this is a standard theorem on partial differentiation.1 We can write it as a dot product, dt = ∇t · dl = (∇t)ufdu + (∇t)vgdv + (∇t)whdw, (A.3) provided we define (∇t)u ≡ 1 f ∂t ∂u , (∇t)v ≡ 1 g ∂t ∂v , (∇t)w ≡ 1 h ∂t ∂w . The gradient of t, then, is ∇t ≡ 1 f ∂t ∂u ˆu + 1 g ∂t ∂vˆv + 1 h ∂t ∂w ˆw. (A.4) If you now pick the appropriate expressions for f , g,and h from Table A.1, you can easily generate the formulas for ∇t in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, as they appear inside the front cover of the book. From Eq. A.3 it follows that the total change in t, as you go from point a to point b (Fig. A.1), is t(b) − t(a) = ∫ b a dt = ∫ b a (∇t) · dl, (A.5) Table A.1.

Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed., John Wiley, New York (1983), Chap. 4, Sect. 3. 580 A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates which is the fundamental theorem for gradients (not much to prove, really, in this case). Notice that the integral is independent of the path taken from a to b. A.4 Divergence Suppose that we have a vector function, A(u, v, w) = Auˆu + Avˆv + Aw ˆw, and we wish to evaluate the integral ∮ A·da over the surface of the infinites- imal volume generated by starting at the point (u, v, w) and increasing each of the coordinates in succession by an infinitesimal amount (Fig. A.2). Because the coordinates are orthogonal, this is (at least, in the infinitesimal limit) a rectangular solid, whose sides have lengths dlu = fdu, dlv = gdv, and dlw = hdw, and whose volume is therefore dτ = dlu dlv dlw = (fgh) du dv dw. (A.6) (The sides are not just du, dv, dw – after all, v might be an angle, in which case dv doesn’t even have the dimensions of length. The correct expressions follow from Eq. A.1.) w u h dwf dug dv v (u + du, v, w) (u + du, v + dv, w) (u + du, v + dv, w + dw) (u, v, w) (u, v + dv, w + dw) (u, v + dv, w) (u, v, w + dw) ˆ ˆ ˆ Fig. A.2 581 A.4 Divergence For the front surface, da = −(gh) dv dw ˆu, so that A · da = −(ghAu) dv dw. The back surface is identical (except for the sign), only this time the quantity ghAu is to be evaluated at (u + du), instead of u. Since for any (differentiable) function F (u), F (u + du) − F (u) = dF du du (in the limit), the front and back together amount to a contribution [ ∂ ∂u (ghAu)] du dv dw = 1 fgh ∂ ∂u (ghAu) dτ. By the same token, the right- and left-hand sides yield 1 fgh ∂ ∂v (fhAv) dτ, and the top and bottom give 1 fgh ∂ ∂w (fgAw) dτ. All told, then, ∮ A · da = 1 fgh [ ∂ ∂u (ghAu) + ∂ ∂v (fhAv) + ∂ ∂w (fgAw)] dτ. (A.7) The coefficient of dτ serves to define the divergence of A in curvilinear coordinates: ∇ · A ≡ 1 fgh [ ∂ ∂u (ghAu) + ∂ ∂v (fhAv) + ∂ ∂w (fgAw)], (A.8) and Eq. A.7 becomes ∮ A · da = (∇ · A) dτ. (A.9) Using Table A.1, you can now derive the formulas for the divergence in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, which appear in the front cover of the book. As it stands, Eq. A.9 does not prove the divergence theorem, for it per- tains only to infinitesimal volumes, and rather special infinitesimal volumes at that. Of course, a finite volume can be broken up into infinitesimal pieces, and Eq. A.9 can be applied to each one. The trouble is, when you then add up all the bits, the left-hand side is not just an integral over the outer surface, but over all those tiny internal surfaces as well. Luckily, however, these contributions cancel in pairs, for each internal surface occurs as the boundary of two adjacent infinitesimal volumes, and since da always points 582 A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates Fig. A.3 outward, A · da has the opposite sign for the two members of each pair (Fig. A.3). Only those surfaces that bound a single chunk – which is to say, only those at the outer boundary – survive when everything is added up. For finite regions, then, ∮ A · da = ∫ (∇ · A) dτ, (A.10) and you need integrate only over the external surface.2 This establishes the divergence theorem. A.5 Curl To obtain the curl in curvilinear coordinates, we calculate the line integral, ∮ A · dl, around the infinitesimal loop generated by starting at (u, v, w) and suc- cessively increasing u and v by infinitesimal amounts, holding w constant (Fig. A.4). The surface is a rectangle (at least, in the infinitesimal limit), of length dlu = fdu, width dlv = gdv,and area da = (fg) du dv ˆw. (A.11) Assuming the coordinate system is right handed, ˆw points out of the page in Fig. A.4. Having chosen this as the positive direction for da, we are obliged by the right-hand rule to run the line integral counterclockwise, as shown. Along the bottom segment, dl = fdu ˆu, 2 What about regions that cannot be fit perfectly by rectangular solids no matter how tiny they are – such as planes cut at an angle to the coordinate lines? It’s not hard to dispose of this case; try thinking it out for yourself, or look at H. M. Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl and All That, W. W. Norton, New York (1973), starting with Prob. II-15. 583 A.5 Curl (u + du, v + dv, w)(u, v + dv, w) (u + du, v, w)(u, v, w) g dv f du u vˆ ˆ Fig. A.4 so A · dl = (fAu) du. Along the top leg, the sign is reversed, and fAu is evaluated at (v + dv) rather than v. Taken together, these two edges give [−(fAu)||v+dv + (fAu)||v] du = −[ ∂ ∂v (fAu)] du dv. Similarly, the right- and left-hand sides yield [ ∂ ∂u (gAv)] du dv, so the total is ∮ A · dl = [ ∂ ∂u (gAv) − ∂ ∂v (fAu)] du dv = 1 fg [ ∂ ∂u (gAv) − ∂ ∂v (fAu)] ˆw · da. (A.12) The coefficient of da on the right serves to define the w component of the curl. Constructing the u and v components in the same way, we have ∇ × A ≡ 1 gh [ ∂ ∂v (hAw) − ∂ ∂w (gAv)]ˆu + 1 fh [ ∂ ∂w (fAu) − ∂ ∂u (hAw)]ˆv + 1 fg [ ∂ ∂u (gAv) − ∂ ∂v (fAu)] ˆw, (A.13) and Eq. A.11 generalizes to ∮ A · dl = (∇ × A) · da. (A.14) Using Table A.1, you can now derive the formulas for the curl in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates. Equation A.14 does not by itself prove Stokes’ theorem, however, because at this point it pertains only to very special infinitesimal surfaces. Again, we can chop any finite surface into infinitesimal pieces and apply Eq. A.14 to each one (Fig. A.5). When we add them up, though, we obtain (on the left) not only a line integral around the outer boundary, but a lot of 584 A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates Fig. A.5 tiny line integrals around the internal loops as well. Fortunately, as before, the internal contributions cancel in pairs, because every internal line is the edge of two adjacent loops running in opposite directions. Consequently, Eq. A.14 can be extended to finite surfaces, ∮ A · dl = ∫ (∇ × A) · da, (A.15) and the line integral is to be taken over the external boundary only.3 This establishes Stokes’ theorem. A.6 Laplacian Since the Laplacian of a scalar is by definition the divergence of the gradient, we can read off from Eqs. A.4 and A.8 the general formula ∇ 2t ≡ 1 fgh [ ∂ ∂u ( gh f ∂t ∂u ) + ∂ ∂v ( fh g ∂t ∂v ) + ∂ ∂w ( fg h ∂t ∂w ) ]. (A.16) Once again, you are invited to use Table A.1 to derive the Laplacian in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, and thus to confirm the formulas inside the front cover. 3 What about surfaces that cannot be fit perfectly by tiny rectangles, no matter how small they are (such as triangles) or surfaces that do not correspond to holding one coordinate fixed? If such cases trouble you, and you cannot resolve them for yourself, look at Schey, footnote 2, Prob. III-2. B The Helmholtz Theorem Suppose we are told that the divergence of a vector function F(r) is a specified scalar function D(r): ∇ · F = D,(B.1) and the curl of F(r) is a specified vector function C(r): ∇ × F = C.(B.2) For consistency, C must be divergenceless, ∇ · C = 0, (B.3) because the divergence of a curl is always zero. Question: Can we, on the basis of this information, determine the function F?If D(r) and C(r) go to zero sufficiently rapidly at infinity, the answer is yes, as I will show by explicit construction. I claim that F = −∇U + ∇ × W,(B.4) where U (r) ≡ 1 4π ∫ D(r′) dτ′ (B.5) and W(r) ≡ 1 4π ∫ C(r′) dτ′;(B.6) the integrals are over all of space, and, as always, = |r − r′|. For if F is given by Eq. B.4, then its divergence (using Eq. 1.102)is ∇ · F = −∇ 2U = − 1 4π ∫ D∇ 2 ( 1 ) dτ′ = ∫ D(r′)δ3(r − r′) dτ′ = D(r). (Remember that the divergence of a curl is zero, so the W term drops out, and note that the differentiation is with respect to r, which is contained in .) So the divergence is right; how about the curl? ∇ × F = ∇ × (∇ × W) = −∇ 2W + ∇(∇ · W).(B.7) (Since the curl of a gradient is zero, the U term drops out.) Now −∇ 2W = − 1 4π ∫ C∇ 2 ( 1 ) dτ′ = ∫ C(r′)δ3(r − r′) dτ′ = C(r), 586 B The Helmholtz Theorem which is perfect – I’ll be done if I can just persuade you that the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. B.7 vanishes. Using integration by parts (Eq. 1.59), and noting that derivatives of with respect to primed coor- dinates differ by a sign from those with respect to unprimed coordinates, we have 4π∇ · W = ∫ C · ∇( 1 ) dτ′ = − ∫ C · ∇′ ( 1 ) dτ′ = ∫ 1 ∇′ · C dτ − ∮ 1 C · da.(B.8) But the divergence of C is zero, by assumption (Eq. B.3), and the surface integral (way out at infinity) will vanish, as long as C goes to zero sufficiently rapidly. Of course, that proof tacitly assumes that the integrals in Eqs. B.5 and B.6 converge – otherwise U and W don’t exist at all. At the large r′ limit, where ≈ r′, the integrals have the form ∫ ∞ X (r′) r′ r′2 dr′ = ∫ ∞ r′X (r′) dr′.(B.9) (Here X stands for D or C, as the case may be.) Obviously, X (r′) must go to zero at large r′ – but that’s not enough: if X ∼ 1/r′, the integrand is constant, so the integral blows up, and even if X ∼ 1/r′2, the integral is a logarithm, which is still no good at r′ →∞. Evidently, the divergence and curl of F must go to zero more rapidly than 1/r 2 for the proof to hold. (Incidentally, this is more than enough to ensure that the surface integral in Eq. B.8 vanishes.) Now, assuming these conditions on D(r) and C(r) are met, is the solution in Eq. B.4 unique? The answer is clearly no,for we canadd to F any vector function whose divergence and curl both vanish, and the result still has divergence D and curl C. However, it so happens that there is no function that has zero divergence and zero curl everywhere and goes to zero at infinity (see Section 3.1.5). So if we include a requirement that F(r) goes to zero as r →∞, then solution B.4 is unique.1 Now that all the cards are on the table, I can state the Helmholtz theorem more rigorously: If the divergence D(r) and the curl C(r) of a vector function F(r) are specified, and if they both go to zero faster than 1/r 2 as r →∞, and if F(r) goes to zero as r →∞, then F is given uniquely by Eq. B.4. 1 Typically, we do expect the electric and magnetic fields to go to zero at large distances from the charges and currents that produce them, so this is not an unreasonable stipulation. Occasionally, one encounters artificial problems in which the charge or current distribution itself extends to infinity – infinite wires, for instance, or infinite planes. In such cases, other means must be found to establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Maxwell’s equations. 587 B The Helmholtz Theorem The Helmholtz theorem has an interesting corollary: Any (differentiable) vector function F(r) that goes to zero faster than 1/r as r →∞ can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a vector:2 F(r) = ∇( −1 4π ∫ ∇′ · F(r′) dτ′) + ∇ × ( 1 4π ∫ ∇′ × F(r′) dτ′). (B.10) For example, in electrostatics, ∇ · E = ρ/ϵ0 and ∇ × E = 0,so E(r) = −∇( 1 4πϵ0 ∫ ρ(r′) dτ′) = −∇V (B.11) (where V is the scalar potential), while in magnetostatics ∇ · B = 0and ∇ × B = μ0J,so B(r) = ∇ × ( μ0 4π ∫ J(r′) dτ′) = ∇ × A (B.12) (where A is the vector potential). 2 As a matter of fact, any differentiable vector function whatever (regardless of its behavior at infinity) can be written as a gradient plus a curl, but this more general result does not follow directly from the Helmholtz theorem, nor does Eq. B.10 supply the explicit construction, since the integrals, in general, diverge. One way to prove it relies on the existence theorem for solutions to Poisson’s equation. Given F,let f ≡ ∇ · F; then there exists a function h whose Laplacian is f : ∇ 2h = f . It follows that ∇ · (F − ∇h) = 0. But any divergenceless vector can be written as the curl of a vector (call it H): F − ∇h = ∇ × H,or F = ∇h + ∇ × H. C Units In our units (the Système International), Coulomb’s law reads F = 1 4πϵ0 q1q2 2 ˆ (SI).(C.1) Mechanical quantities are measured in meters, kilograms, seconds, and charge is in coulombs (Table C.1). In the Gaussian system, the constant in front is, in effect, absorbed into the unit of charge, so that F = q1q2 2 ˆ (Gaussian).(C.2) Mechanical quantities are measured in centimeters, grams, seconds, and charge is in electrostatic units (or esu). For what it’s worth, an esu is a (dyne)1/2-centimeter. Converting electrostatic equations from SI to Gaus- sian units is not difficult: just set ϵ0 → 1 4π . For example, the energy stored in an electric field (Eq. 2.45), U = ϵ0 2 ∫ E2 dτ (SI), becomes U = 1 8π ∫ E2 dτ (Gaussian). (Formulas pertaining to fields inside dielectrics are not so easy to translate, because of differing definitions of displacement, susceptibility, and so on; see Table C.2.) The Biot–Savart law, which for us reads B = μ0 4π I ∫ dl × ˆ 2 (SI),(C.3) becomes, in the Gaussian system, B = I c ∫ dl × ˆ 2 (Gaussian),(C.4) where c is the speed of light, and current is measured in esu/s. The Gaussian unit of magnetic field (the gauss) is the one quantity from this system in everyday use: people speak of volts, amperes, henries, and so on (all SI units), but for some reason they tend to measure magnetic fields in gauss (the Gaussian unit); the correct SI unit is the tesla (10 4 gauss). 589 CUnits Table C.1.

Thus the Lorentz force law, which we have written F = q(E + v × B)(SI),(C.5) (indicating that E/B has the dimensions of velocity), takes the form F = q(E + v c × B) (Gaussian).(C.6) In effect, the magnetic field is “scaled up” by a factor of c. This reveals more starkly the parallel structure of electricity and magnetism.
