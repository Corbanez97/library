The ether was theorized as a required propagation medium and privileged inertial frame for electromagnetic waves. The observation of this entity could bring the uniﬁcation of magnetism, electricity, and light to a close. One possible method of measurement of the eﬀect of such an absolute entity – which was the approach of the Michelson-Morley experiment – was the velocity of light relative to its ﬂow. This experiment “undermined the whole structure of the old ether theory and thus served to introduce the new theory of relativity”. Einstein’s acumen lay in the physical interpretation of the result of the Michelson- Morley experiment. Physical laws should be independent of the absolute velocity of an observer. The validity of the Maxwell equations, especially the velocity of light in a va- cuum, and the relativity principle are foundations for the Special Theory of Relativity. This ﬁrst theory is restricted to a speciﬁc set of reference frames. The Lorentz Transfor- mations are particular to inertial frames, particles in rectilinear uniform motion. This restrictive characteristic gives the impression that the Galilean coordinates are a fundamental referential, even though there is no reason why to believe it is so. It is easy to see that from a Non-Lorentzian change of coordinates geometrical forces could arise. But this same phenomenon can be used to “transform away” gravitational forces. The Principle of Equivalence states that a gravitational ﬁeld of force is strictly equivalent to one introduced by a transformation of coordinates and no possible experiment can distinguish between the two. Einstein’s second theory is a generalization to all these possible reference frames, even though we may need to look into complex geometries and non-euclidean coordinate systems. As Einstein says in his 1916 work “The mathematical apparatus useful for the general relativity theory, lay already complete in the Absolute Diﬀerential Calculus”. 1.1 Diﬀerential Geometry Our minimal mathematical representation of spacetime is a given set of spacetime points, M, which locally resembles Euclidean space. Furthermore, this space can be parametrized by a set of real numbers, with which we can describe the dynamical evolution of a system using diﬀerential equations. The set of spacetime points with these two characteristics is called a diﬀerentiable manifold. (Here I’m skipping the deﬁnition of coordinate charts, atlas, tangent/cotangent spaces, etc.) In a single point of the manifold, we can describe two vector spaces. First, TpM, the 26 Capítulo 1. General Relativity tangent space of M at the point p. TpM is a set of vectors V = V µ∂µ, (1.1) where V µ are the components and ∂µ are the basis. These objects take a function deﬁned on M to a real number on R. The vector components transform according to the following law: ̃V ν = ∂ ̃xν ∂xµ V µ. (1.2) And, T ∗ p M, the cotangent space of M at the point p. This space consists of a set of forms w = wµdxµ, (1.3) which in turn take a vector from TpM to a real number in R. Forms components transform accordingly: ̃wν = ∂xµ ∂ ̃xν wµ. (1.4) Knowing a set of vectors (V µ1, V µ2, . . . , V µn) and a set of form (wν1, wν2, . . . , wνm), their product will transform as: ̃V α1 ̃V α2 . . . ̃V αn ̃wβ1 ̃wβ2 . . . ̃wβm = ∂ ̃xα1 ∂xµ1 ∂ ̃xα2 ∂xµ2 . . . ∂ ̃xαn ∂xµn ∂xν1 ∂ ̃xβ1 ∂xν2 ∂ ̃xβ2 . . . ∂xνm ∂ ̃xβm V µ1V µ2 . . . V µnwν1wν2 . . . wνm. (1.5) Objects that respect the transformation law above are called tensors and can be thought of as the product of vectors and forms; A µ1µ2...µnν1ν2...νm = V µ1V µ2 . . . V µnwν1wν2 . . . wνm. (1.6) We say the order of a tensor is (n, m) when it is constructed from n vectors and m forms. Moreover, following the same line of thought, one can create a diﬀerent ranked tensor from the product of two other tensors. T µν σλ = A µνBσλ. (1.7) Notice how we have combined two lower-ranked tensors, (2, 0) and (0, 2), to create a third with order (2 + 0, 0 + 2). Another possible operation is the rank reduction of a tensor. This can be done by simply contracting two indexes of a tensor. T µ ν = T µσ σν . (1.8) The contraction between two indexes transformed a (2, 2) tensor into a (1, 1) tensor. 1.1. Diﬀerential Geometry 27 An important feature of tensors is their symmetries. We say a tensor is symmetric if Aµν = Aνµ, (1.9) and antisymmetric if Aµν = −Aνµ. (1.10) A vital remark regarding the dynamic of an entity. These mathematical objects are deﬁned in a point of our diﬀerentiable manifold. For instance, comparing vectors from two distinct points is, so far, a fool’s errand. They exist in entirely diﬀerent mathematical spaces and are, therefore, incomparable. We will soon explore how one might connect such particular spaces. We have hitherto described arbitrary tensors without any speciﬁc usage for the un- derstanding of the general theory. First and foremost, we shall do a brief study of the metric tensor, or as Einstein called it, the covariant fundamental tensor. The metric tensor is a bilinear map from vectors on the tangent space to a real number. The line element is the distance between two points in a given space and is deﬁned as ds2 = gµνdx µdxν. (1.11) The metric is a symmetric tensor. Moreover, it is an orthogonal tensor, i.e., gµσgσν = δ ν µ . For this reason, it is conventional to use the metric to raise and lower indexes; gµνA ν = Aµ. (1.12) Let’s go back to the remark made about the connectivity of points on a manifold. We aim to create an entirely covariant theory; therefore, we expect that our mathematical apparatus should be invariant under the tensor transformation law. It is easy to see that the partial derivative – a primary candidate for our connectivity problem – does not transform accordingly (Leibniz Rule). Hence, we must deﬁne a covariant derivative. Caring only about the free indexes, we may add the following correction to the partial derivative ∇µV ν = ∂µV ν + Γν µσV σ. (1.13) This factor is called connection. Furthermore, we impose that ̃∇µ ̃V ν = ∂xα ∂ ̃xµ ∂ ̃xν ∂xβ ∇αV β, (1.14) which makes the connection transform in such a way that it “cancels out” the irregularities in the partial derivative transformation. The covariant derivative of a form is ∇µwν = ∂µwν − Γ σ µνwσ, (1.15) 28 Capítulo 1. General Relativity and its eﬀect on a scalar is simply the partial derivative. Finally, we also expect the connection to satisfy two other characteristics. First, it should be torsion-free, i.e., symmetric in its two lower indexes. Secondly, it should be metric-compatible, meaning the covariant derivative of the metric is null. Following all these rules, we can uniquely deﬁne a connection. The Christoﬀel Symbol, Γ µ αβ = 1 2gµν [ ∂gαν ∂xβ + ∂gβν ∂xα − ∂gαβ ∂xν ] , (1.16) is the only possible torsion-free, metric-compatible connection. Einstein’s general theory is based on this connection. We can deﬁne a directional covariant derivative D dλV ν = dxµ dλ ∇µV ν, (1.17) over which we bring attention to a special case. When the above derivative is null we say that the vector V ν is being parallel transported along the path dxµ/dλ. Such requirements give rise to d dλV ν + Γν αβ dxα dλ V β = 0, (1.18) known as the equation of parallel transport. With the knowledge we gathered so far, we are now able to derive the geodesic equation of a timelike path. From (1.11), we shall take ds as the proper time dτ and parametrize the equation to a real value λ. Furthermore, we can integrate the expression to ﬁnd τ . This leaves us with τ = ∫ √ −gµν dxµ dλ dxν dλ dλ. (1.19) We added a minus sign to turn the interval positive. For simplicity, we rename the term inside the square root as f . Additionally, we take an inﬁnitesimal functional variation of the equation, therefore, δτ = ∫ δ√−f dλ = ∫ 1 2(−f ) − 1 2 δ(−f )dλ. (1.20) Using the identity in terms of the four-velocity U µ = dxµ/dτ , gµν dx µ dτ dxν dτ = gµνU µU ν = −1, (1.21) and parametrizing λ to τ we can rewrite (1.20) as δτ = −1 2 ∫ δf dτ. (1.22) 1.1. Diﬀerential Geometry 29 By adding small variations to the metric and the path, xµ → xµ + δxµ, (1.23) gµν → gµν + δgµν, (1.24) we can solve to the ﬁrst order and analyze the integrand at the boundary using the Leibniz Rule. The resultant integrand should be null by imposing no variations of the proper time. Finally, the following is true: d2xµ dτ 2 + Γµ αβ dxα dτ dxβ dτ = 0. (1.25) The equation above represents the path that extremizes the proper time and is called the geodesic equation. Once we are set on a particular metric we can use this equation to ﬁnd the geodesic paths. It is essential to point out that any parameter linearly related to τ will leave (1.25) unchanged. These are called aﬃne parameters. Furthermore, by identifying dxµ/dτ = V µ, we can see that (1.25) becomes (1.18); D dτ V µ = dV µ dτ + Γµ αβV αV β = 0. (1.26) This means that the geodesic is a path in which a vector is parallel transported along itself, i.e., a straight line is a path that parallel transport its tangent vector. Using the symmetry of V αV β one can rewrite (1.18), yielding dVµ dτ = 1 2 ∂µgαβV αV β. (1.27) If the metric is independent of some particular coordinate xµ, then the form Vµ is invariant. In other words, there is an isometry of the metric of which V µ is a conserved quantity. This construction is highly dependent on coordinates, whereas the following is true in a covariant manner: ∇µKν + ∇νKµ = 0. (1.28) (1.28) is called Killing Equation, and ⃗K is the Killing Vector. Carrying the metric along the ﬁeld of vectors ⃗K leaves it unchanged. Each Killing Vector Field in an n-dimensional manifold represents a unique isometry. The word curvature is expected to come up when reading about general relativity and diﬀerential geometry. In our case, we shall study the intrinsic curvature, a quantity that can be measured within the geometry. This intrinsicality does not require our manifold to be embedded in a higher-dimensional space. But how does one measure such a thing? The answer lies in the eﬀect curvature has on vectors’ cyclic transportation along our geometry. Let’s take the commutator of the covariant derivative over a test vector; [∇µ, ∇ν] V σ = ∇µ∇νV σ − ∇ν∇µV σ. (1.29) 30 Capítulo 1. General Relativity Using (1.13) and some algebraic tricks, we end up with: [∇µ, ∇ν] V σ = (∂µΓ σ νγ − ∂νΓσ µγ + Γσ µλΓ λ νγ + Γσ νλΓ λ µγ) V γ. (1.30) The expression inside the parenthesis is the transformation acting on the vector after the cycle. The Riemann Tensor is deﬁned as Rσγµν = ∂µΓ σ νγ − ∂νΓ σ µγ + Γσ µλΓ λ νγ + Γσ νλΓ λ µγ, (1.31) and it is used to measure the intrinsic curvature of a manifold. Reﬂecting on the covariant nature of the equations above it is easy to see that if the curvature vanishes for a particular coordinate system, it will so in every other. The curvature tensor is also commonly represented with a lowered ﬁrst index, Rσγµν. One of the main properties of the curvature tensor is called the Bianchi Identity. We can ﬁnd it by performing cyclic permutations of the covariant derivative of (1.31): ∇λRσγµν + ∇σRγλµν + ∇γRλ σµν = 0. (1.32) There are two important contractions of (1.31). The ﬁrst is called the Ricci tensor. We ﬁnd it by contracting the ﬁrst and third indexes of the curvature tensor; Rµν = Rσµσν. (1.33) The second is called the Ricci scalar. It is the contraction of the indexes in the Ricci Tensor: R = Rµ µ. (1.34) To create a symmetric (0, 2) tensor from the Ricci Tensor and the Ricci Scalar, (1.32) can be contracted twice; resulting in ∇ µRµν − 1 2 ∇µRgµν = 0. (1.35) Applying the linearity of the covariant derivative we deﬁne the Einstein Tensor as Gµν = Rµν − 1 2Rgµν, (1.36) which sustain the following property: ∇µGµν = 0. (1.37) 1.2 General Relativity Now that we paved the way with the necessary mathematical introduction, we can proceed to generalize the gravitational theory. First and foremost, let’s go about how one 1.2. General Relativity 31 might take a law of physics usable in ﬂat space to curved spacetime. A sort of straight- forward way is called the minimal-coupling principle. The minimal-coupling principle is simply an algorithm for rewriting a given law in a covariant manner. Such transforma- tion can be made by transforming variables into tensors, and the partial derivative into covariant derivatives. As previously hinted, gravity experienced by a free-falling particle should be merely an expression of the selected coordinate system; gravity is no diﬀerent than a geometrical force. Hence, it seems reasonable to replace the gravitational ﬁeld with a geometrical entity, e.g., the metric tensor, or the curvature tensor. Moreover, another important entity in gravitation is mass. Since we know that mass is a speciﬁc representation of energy, we should substitute it with a tensor that encom- passes all its possible forms. We want a (0, 2) symmetric tensor that contains information about the distribution of energy in a system. Additionally, this tensor should extend the continuity equation to our curved spacetime. The described tensor is known; it is the energy-momentum tensor Tµν. It can be thought of as a matrix of all combinations of the ﬂux of µ momentum across surfaces of constant xν. Tµν is constructed in a way that ∇µTµν = 0, (1.38) i.e., the total energy is conserved. (1.38) is the covariant form of the continuity equation. The gravitational ﬁeld is described by the Poisson Equation: ∇2Φ = 4πGρ. (1.39) By following the minimal-coupling principle we can propose a proportionality between the second-order derivative of a (0, 2) symmetric geometry-related tensor and the energy- momentum tensor. Unfortunately, since the (1.16) is metric-compatible, direct derivations of the metric are not a great candidate. However, the Ricci Tensor does embody this twice-diﬀerentiated metric in itself. Sadly, Rµν is not consistent with (1.38). The required tensor was already derivated in the last section by twice contracting (1.32). The Einstein Tensor respects all requirements for the equivalence between energy and space-time curvature. Finally, we may propose the following ﬁeld equation: Gµν = κTµν. (1.40) We can ﬁnd κ by solving the equation for a massive body at rest in a weak gravitational ﬁeld. The energy-momentum tensor will be just the energy density across time, i.e., the classical energy density ρ = T00. The metric will be the Minkowski ﬂat space plus small perturbations, gµν = ηµν + hµν, (1.41) 32 Capítulo 1. General Relativity known as the weak-ﬁeld limit. A few algebra yields ∇2h00 = −κρ, (1.42) where the similarity with (1.39) is evident. Moreover, using the weak-ﬁeld limit for non- relativistic particles, the geodesic equation shows us h00 = −2Φ. (1.43) With the last two equations, we can see that Gµν = 8πGTµν (1.44) is the generalization of (1.39). (1.44) is Einstein’s Field Equation. It brings to light the subtle reality that energy is the curvature of spacetime. 1.3 Cosmology In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the cosmos by proposing the existence of a cosmological constant, Λ, to balance the universe and keep it static. This idea was based on the prevailing belief at the time that the universe was static and unchanging. However, in the 1920s, Alexander Friedmann disregarded the need for a closed uni- verse, instead, he theorized the possibility of a dynamical cosmos with a variable radius. He used (1.44) to show that the universe could be either expanding or contracting, which challenged Einstein’s idea of a static universe. To ﬁnd such solutions, we begin with the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle states that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic. These two cha- racteristics give rise to rotational and translational symmetry. Constraining our possible metrics to those with such symmetries we are forced to select from a set of maximally symmetric spaces. The set of maximally symmetric spaces contains those spaces that have the same num- ber of Killing vector ﬁelds as the Euclidian Space, but with arbitrary constant curvature. This arbitrarity allows three groups: zero, positive, and negative curvature. The only diﬀerence within these groups is the scaling, therefore, we will only consider (−1, 01) as possible values. Since the curvature is constant in such spaces the curvature tensor, (1.31), is a Lorentz- invariant in a locally ﬂat coordinate system xˆµ. Therefore, we can build Rˆσˆγ ˆµˆν from another known invariant tensor, e.g., the metric. By trying to match the symmetries of (1.31), we arrive at the following proportionality: Rˆσˆγ ˆµˆν = A (gˆσ ˆµgˆγ ˆν − gˆσˆνgˆγ ˆµ) . (1.45) 1.3. Cosmology 33 The same is true for every other coordinate system. Moreover, we can contract booth sides twice yielding the general form of the Riemann Curvature Tensor for a maximally symmetric manifold; Rσγµν = R n(n − 1) (gσµgγν − gσνgγµ) . (1.46) We are interested in 3D spaces, which will compose the leaves of constant time. By restricting our curvature to those of three dimensions, we deﬁne the Gaussian curvature as K = R 6 . (1.47) Let’s begin by assuming a general spatially-dynamic metric ds2 = −dt 2 + a(t)dσ2, (1.48) where dσ2 is the metric of a spherically-symmetric 3-space given by dσ2 = e2β(r)dr2 + r2dΩ2. (1.49) By computing the curvature of this general metric and using the curvature tensor for maximally symmetric spaces we can ﬁx e 2β(r) = 1 1 − Kr2 . (1.50) Rewriting everything and parametrizing the radius, r = √αr, to restrain K = αk we arrive at the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker Metric (FLRW Metric) ds2 = −dt 2 + a(t) ( dr2 1 − kr2 + r2dΩ2) . (1.51) We have a(t) as the scale factor and k = −1, 0, +1 as the curvature. Prior to solving Einstein’s ﬁeld equation, it is necessary to describe the energy within the universe. The fundamental assumption is that the cosmos is permeated by a perfect ﬂuid composed of various entities. The following energy-momentum tensor can describe such ﬂuid: Tµν =         ρ 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 p         . (1.52) The structure of (1.52) can be understood by the isotropy of the perfect ﬂuid. Isotropy results in the diagonal form of this tensor. Moreover, it also explains the equal valued pressure in all three directions. 34 Capítulo 1. General Relativity With cosmo’s energy content and its related metric, we can solve (1.44) for the variable radius a(t). Although the process is straightforward, it is long and mechanical. First, we ﬁnd all Christoﬀel symbols for the FLRW metric. Secondly, with all possible symbols, we compute the Riemann tensor; we will contract to ﬁnd the Ricci tensor and contract again for the Ricci scalar. Now, we are capable of analyzing the time and spatial portions of the Field Equation separately. By doing so, we arrive at two equations: ( ˙a(t) a(t) )2 = 8πG 3 ρ(t) − k a(t)2 , (1.53) ¨a(t) a(t) = −4πG 3 (ρ(t) + 3p) . (1.54) These are respectively the First and Second Friedmann Equations. (1.53) is derived from the time portion of the Field Equation, and the (1.54) is derived from a substitution of (1.53) into the spatial portion of the Field Equation. Not long after Friedmann’s remarks on Relativistic Cosmology, the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître arrived at similar equations and theorized about the cosmos at t = 0. In 1927 he proposed that the universe began as a “primordial atom”, which exploded creating all energy components of the universe. Moreover, his calculations showed a linear relationship between the velocity of stellar bodies and their distances from an observer. In 1929, Hubble published his measurement of the relation between the redshift of galaxies and their distances, solidifying the idea of a cosmological expansion. The Hubble-Lemaître Law states v = H0d, (1.55) where H0 is the current Hubble constant, v is the relative velocity, and d is the distance. By replacing the velocity of a stellar body with the velocity of the expansion and the distance by the radius we can also write the Hubble parameter as H = ˙a a. (1.56) The Hubble parameter, H, represents the rate at which the universe is expanding, and the current rate, H0, is one of the parameters that can be determined using observational data. It is useful to deﬁne a critical energy density required for the universe to have zero curvature, or k = 0. By constraining the universe in this way, we can solve the ﬁrst Friedmann equation (1.53) for ρcrit; ρcrit = 3H 2 8πG. (1.57) 1.3. Cosmology 35 A general density parameter in terms of ρcrit is given by Ω = ρ ρcrit . (1.58) Before we proceed with the analysis of these parameters, it is necessary to understand the distribution of energy density in the universe and how each component evolves with the expansion of the universe. For any perfect ﬂuid (1.52) is conserved, i.e., ∇µT µ ν = 0. The time component of this derivation yields ∇µT µ 0 = ∂0T 0 0 + Γµ µ0T 0 0 − Γ α µ0T µ 0 = 0. (1.59) Computing T µ ν , and replacing the symbols obtained from the FLRW metric we ﬁnd the ﬂuid equation; ∂ρ ∂t + 3 ˙a a (ρ + p) = 0. (1.60) Each component of the cosmo has a unique equation of state p = wρ. (1.61) Replacing (1.61) in (1.60), and solving for ρ in terms of a we ﬁnd ρ = ρ0a−3(1+w). (1.62) The visible components of the universe are matter and radiation. Since the equation of state for each is known, their evolutions are respectively ρm = ρm0a−3, (1.63) ρr = ρr0a−4. (1.64) Additionally, another type of energy may arise as a possible interpretation of the cosmo- logical constant Λ. The most general form of the Field Equation has Λ as an integration constant. One can think of this constant as a part of the energy-momentum tensor that emerges from the vacuum. The central principle regarding the vacuum energy density is how it should evolve with the variation of the scale factor. As the size of the cosmos increases or decreases, the amount of vacuum energy changes accordingly. Therefore, its density should remain constant across the evolution of the universe. For w = −1, we can see in (1.62) a constant vacuum energy density; ρΛ = ρΛ0. (1.65) Moreover, one vital corollary of w = −1 is p = −ρΛ. (1.66) 36 Capítulo 1. General Relativity Finally, the energy density for the whole universe can be written as ρ(t) = ρm(t) + ρr(t) + ρΛ(t) = ρm0a−3 + ρr0a−4 + ρΛ. (1.67) Dividing by the critical density, we have the density parameter Ω = Ωm a3 + Ωr a4 + ΩΛ, (1.68) We have omitted the subscript indicating that these parameters represent their current values for simplicity. Just like H0, the set of parameters (Ωm, Ωr, ΩΛ) can be nummerically ﬁxed with observational data. We are, at last, close to an equation that couples all of our cosmological parameters of interest. We can deﬁne a ﬁnal parameter by rewriting the ﬁrst Friedmann Equation in terms of the Hubble and density parameters. Dividing (1.53) by H 2 0 , identifying (1.57), and deﬁning Ωc = − k H 2 0 (1.69) we can solve the result for H and ﬁnd H 2 = H 2 0 ( Ωm a3 + Ωr a4 + Ωc a2 + ΩΛ ) . (1.70) The equation (1.70) lacks an observable variable. However, using the Geodesic Equa- tion (1.25), one can ﬁnd a relation between the scale factor a(t) and the visible wavelength. To ﬁnd this equality, we ﬁrst deﬁne the four-momentum of a particle P µ = dxµ dλ = (E, pr, pθ, pφ). (1.71) From the relativistic energy-momentum relation a massless particle, such as a photon, will have a four-momentum with zero magnitudes. Furthermore, a photon travels radially across the universe, therefore pθ = pφ = 0. Computing gµνP µP ν we ﬁnd that −E2 + a2 1 − kr2 p2 r = 0. (1.72) Replacing (1.71) into (1.25) and using the chain rule, the time component of the result is E dE dt = −Γ 0 rrp2 r = −a ˙a 1 1 − kr2 p2 r. (1.73) Replacing p2 r from the energy-momentum relation into the equation above we arrive at a solvable relation between energy and the scale factor. 1 E dE dt = − 1 a da dt . (1.74) 1.3. Cosmology 37 Taking a0 = 1, (1.74) yields E = E0 a . (1.75) A commonly used observable is the redshift, deﬁned as z = λobs − λem λem . (1.76) By rewriting (1.75) in terms of λobs and λem, an equation of a(z) emerges; a = 1 1 + z . (1.77) This relation is fundamental. We shall use it to know the scale factor at the moment of the emission of the light we are observing. In close, we can replace the scale factor in (1.70) by (1.77), yielding the Parameter Equation as a function of the redshift; H 2 = H 2 0 (Ωm(1 + z) 3 + Ωr(1 + z)4 + Ωc(1 + z)2 + ΩΛ) . (1.78) The redshift can be used to estimate the distance of a light-emitting object. We can ﬁrst create a grid over the cosmos and use it to map ﬁxed distances between objects. This way, even though the grid is expanding, the measurement within the grid remains constant. We call this the comoving distance, χ(z) = ∫ z 0 dz H(z). (1.79) A value of redshift will always be at a ﬁxed comoving distance χ(z). We can also estimate the distance using the ﬂux of light measured by an observer. This is the luminosity distance, dL, and it can be calculated in terms of (1.79) with dL = (1 + z) H −1 0√|Ωk|Sk [ H0√|Ωk|χ(z) ] . (1.80) Sk(χ) is one of three possible functions depending on the curvature; Sk(χ) =    sin(χ), k = 1 χ, k = 0 sinhχ, k = −1 . (1.81) Finally, we can use the magnitude of an object to estimate its distance. The distance modulus, µ, is the diﬀerence between the apparent magnitude and the absolute magnitude. It is related to (1.80) by µ = 5 log1 0 ( dL 10 ) . (1.82) 39 2 Statistical Methods The primary focus of data analysis is a set of data, observations, {xi}, and an un- derlying relationship between these measurements. These assumptions are largely based on the belief that there is a deeper reality beyond the measurements themselves. Our goal is to extract meaningful information from these data. For us, this relationship is represented by the probability distribution P . The probability of a measurement x given a hypothesis θ is given by P (x|θ). 2.1 Something about estimators 2.1.1 Max Likelihood Estimators 2.1.2 Something about likelihood 2.2 Bayes 2.3 Something about parameters 41 3 Supernovaes as Standard Candles 3.1 Supernovaes Gaussian Distribution 43 4 Results 45 5 Conclusion Os resultado batero tudo. 5.1 Future Researches 2hard4me 47 Referências","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
