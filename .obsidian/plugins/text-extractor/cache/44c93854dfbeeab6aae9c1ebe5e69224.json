This result provides an axiomatic approach to Maxwell’s equations in which charge conservation is emphasized as the fundamental axiom underlying these equations. 1 1. Introduction In classical electrodynamics the conservation of electric charge, which is expressed through the continuity equation ∇ · J + ∂ρ equations. Our derivation of Maxwell’s equations has been commented on by Jeﬁmenko [5,6] and Kapu`scik [7,8]. Colussi and Wickramasekara [9] have stressed the result that Maxwell’s equations, which are Lorentz-invariant, have been obtained from the continuity equation, which is Galilei-invariant according to these authors. An advantage of the derivation of Maxwell’s equations presented in reference 2 is that it naturally introduces the time-dependent extensions of the Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws in the form given by Jeﬁmenko [3,4]. However, a practical disadvantage of such a derivation is that it involves unfamiliar and large identities involving derivatives of retarded quantities. In this paper we extend our three-dimensional derivation of Maxwell’s equations [2] to the four-dimensional spacetime. We show how the covariant form of Maxwell’s equations can be obtained from the continuity equation for the electric charge. The existence theorem for two retarded ﬁelds demonstrated in reference 2 is now formulated for a retarded antisymmetric ﬁeld tensor in spacetime. The existence theorem in spacetime is then applied to the usual electromagnetic four-current and thus the electromagnetic ﬁeld together with the covariant Maxwell equations are obtained. This four-dimensional derivation of Maxwell’s equations is considerably shorter than that formulated in the three-dimensional space. Readers well versed in the mathematics of the spacetime of special relativity could ﬁnd more simple and elegant the four-dimensional derivation because it does not involve large operations on explicit retarded quantities but instead it involves simpliﬁed tensor operations in which retardation is implicit in the retarded Green function of the free-space wave equation. 2. The covariant Maxwell equations Greek indices µ, ν, κ . . . run from 0 to 3; Latin indices i, j, k, . . . run from 1 to 3; x = x µ = (ct, x) is the ﬁeld point and x ′ = x ′µ = (ct ′, x ′) the source point; the signature of the metric of spacetime is (+, −, −, −); εµναβ is the totally antisymmetric four-dimensional tensor with ε0123 = 1 and εijk is the totally antisymmetric three-dimensional tensor with ε123 = 1. Summation convention on repeated indices is adopted. The covariant form of Maxwell’s equations can be written in Gaussian units as: ∂µF µν = 4π and therefore the components of ∗F µν are ∗F i0 = (B)i and ∗F ij = εijk(E)k. The source of the tensor F µν is the electric four-current: J ν = (cρ, J), which is a conserved quantity ∂νJ ν = 0. (3) As above mentioned, equation (3) seems to be a formal consequence of equations (2) because of the identity ∂ν∂µF µν ≡ 0, that is, equations (2) imply equation (3). We will investigate now the converse implication: To what extent equation (3) implies equations (2)? 3. An existence theorem in spacetime Let us formulate the following existence theorem: Given the localized four-vector J ν satisfying the continuity equation ∂νJ ν = 0, (4) there exists the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld F µν = ∫ d4x ′G(∂′µJ ν − ∂′νJ µ), (5) that satisﬁes the ﬁeld equations ∂µF µν = J ν and ∂µ ∗F µν = 0, (6) where G(x, x ′) = δ(t ′ − t + R/c)/(4πR) with R = |x − x ′| is the retarded Green function of the free-space wave equation and ∗F µν = (1/2)εµναβFαβ is the dual of F µν. The function G satisﬁes the free-space wave equation ∂′ µ∂′µG = δ(x − x ′), where δ(x − x ′) is the four- dimensional delta function. The integral in equation (5) is over all spacetime. We note that G is not an explicit Lorentz invariant object. This objection can be avoided by replacing G by the less-known retarded invariant form D(x, x ′) = θ(x0 − x ′ 0)δ[(x − x ′)2]/(2π), where θ is the theta function [10]. The proof of the theorem follows from the tensor identity ∂µG(∂′µJ ν − ∂′νJ µ)−∂′ µ(G∂′νJ µ − J ν∂′µG) = J νδ(x − x ′). (7) This identity is of general validity for a four-vector J ν that satisﬁes equation (4) but oth- erwise is arbitrary. In particular, equation (7) is valid when J ν is localized into a ﬁnite region of spacetime, property that guaranties that surface integrals in spacetime involving 4 J ν vanish at inﬁnity. Equation (7) can be obtained from Eq. (4) as follows. Assume that J ν satisﬁes the continuity equation evaluated at the source point: ∂′ µJ µ = 0. (8) We apply the operator −G∂′ν to equation (8) and add the term J ν∂′ µ∂′µG to both sides: −G∂′ν∂′ µJ µ + J ν∂′ µ∂′µG = J ν∂′ µ∂′µG. (9) The left-hand side of equation (9) can be written as −∂′ µG(∂′µJ ν − ∂′νJ µ) − ∂′ µ(G∂′νJ µ − J ν∂′µG) = J ν∂′ µ∂′µG. (10) When −∂′ µG = ∂µG is used in the ﬁrst term of the left-hand side of equation (10) and ∂′ µ∂′µG = δ(x − x ′) in its right-hand side, we ﬁnally obtain equation (7). We integrate equation (7) over all spacetime ∂µ ∫ d4x ′G(∂′µJ ν − ∂′νJ µ) − ∫ d4x ′∂′ µ(G∂′νJ µ − J ν∂′µG) = ∫ d4x ′J νδ(x − x ′), (11) where ∂µ has been extracted from the ﬁrst integral of the left-hand side. The second integral on this side can be transformed into a surface integral which vanishes at inﬁnity because of J ν is assumed to be a localized quantity. The term on the right-hand side can be integrated yielding J ν. Thus equation (11) reduces to ∂µ ∫ d4x ′G(∂′µJ ν − ∂′νJ µ) = J ν. (12) This equation shows the existence of the antisymmetric tensor F µν = ∫ d4x ′G(∂′µJ ν − ∂′νJ µ), (13) in terms of which equation (12) takes the compact (inhomogeneous) form: ∂µF µν = J ν. (14) The dual of F µν can be written as ∗F µν = εµνκλ∫ d4x ′G∂′ κJλ. (15) We apply the operator ∂µ to equation (15) and perform an integration by parts to obtain ∂µ ∗F µν = εµνκλ∫ d4x ′G∂′ µ∂′ κJλ −∫ d4x ′∂′ µ(εµνκλG∂′ κJλ). (16) 5 The ﬁrst integral vanishes because of the symmetry of the indices µ and κ in ∂′ µ∂′ κ and the antisymmetry of such indices in εµνκλ. The second integral can be transformed into a surface integral which vanishes at inﬁnity. Then equation (16) reduces to the compact (homogeneous) form ∂µ ∗F µν = 0. (17) Once equations (13), (14), and (17) have been obtained, the theorem has been demonstrated. Notice that this theorem applies to any conserved four-vector which does not necessarily belong to the electromagnetic theory. 4. Deriving Maxwell’s equations Let us apply the existence theorem to the four-vector J µ = βJ µ, where J µ = (cρ, J) is the usual electric four-current with ρ and J being the charge and current densities and β is a constant. Then there exists the tensor ﬁeld Gµν = β∫ d4x ′G(∂′µJ ν − ∂′νJ µ), (18) which satisﬁes the ﬁeld equations ∂µGµν = βJ ν and ∂µ ∗Gµν = 0, (19) where ∗Gµν can be written as ∗Gµν = βεµνκλ∫ d4x ′G∂′ κJλ. (20) The constant β belongs to the αβγ-system which allows us to write electromagnetic expres- sions in a way that is independent of units [11]. The constants α, β and γ satisfy the relation α = βγc 2 with c being the speed of light in vacuum [11]. If we let α = 1/ǫ0, β = µ0, and γ = 1, we obtain expressions in SI units, and if we let α = 4π, β = 4π/c, and γ = 1/c, we obtain expressions in Gaussian units. To verify that equations (19) are already the covariant Maxwell equations, that is, that the tensor Gµν identiﬁes with the well-known electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F µν, we proceed as follows. Let us label the components of the tensor Gµν in equation (18) as Gi0 = (βc/α)(X)i and Gij = −εijk(Y)k, where X and Y are two time-dependent vector ﬁelds. The components of the dual tensor ∗Gµν can be obtained from those of Gµν by making the dual changes 6 (βc/α)(X)i → (Y)i and (Y)k → −[1/(γc)](X)k. Notice that βc/α = 1/(γc). It follows that ∗Gi0 = (Y)i and ∗Gij = [1/(γc)]εijk(X)k. Our plan is now to identify the vectors X and Y with the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B. With this purpose in mind, let us consider the i0 component of equation (18) which can be written as (X)i = α where ∗F µν can be written as ∗F µν = βεµνκλ∫ d4x ′G∂′ κJλ. (27) The components of F µν are given by F i0 = βc only the experimental time-independent Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws. In this case the time-independent limit of the i0 component of equation (18) can be written as (X)i = α spacetime with metric signature (+, −, −, −) together with its associated retarded Green function G = δ{t ′ − t + R/c}/(4πR), we consider, for example, an Euclidean four-space [12-14] with metric signature (+, +, +, +) together with its associated retarded-imaginary Green function [14] GI = δ{t ′ − t + R/(ic)}/(4πR), then we obtain a set of Maxwell-like ﬁeld equations in the Euclidean four-space [12-14]. This means that the continuity equation can also imply other electromagnetic theories diﬀerent from that of Maxwell. This is an expected result because charge conservation is independent of the signature of the metric of spacetime. The independence of the signature can be veriﬁed in the equation ∂αJ α = ∂αJα = ∇ · J + ∂ρ Two rival point of views on what is now known as electromagnetic theory coexisted through most of the 19th century. On one hand, the ﬁeld point of view followed by Faraday, Maxwell, Thomson, Fitzgerald, and Larmor who considered the ﬁelds (and their “observable” lines of force) to be the primary objects of the theory. They viewed the charges as manifestations of the terminal points of lines of force having no independent or substantial existence [17]. On the other hand, the charge-interaction point of view followed by Ampere, Neumann and Weber who considered the electromagnetic phenomena as originating in the interaction of charges which was regarded by some as mediated by an ethereal continuum and by others as a direct action at a distance. In the charge-interaction view, charges and currents were the primary objects of the theory and the causes of the forces. Modern ﬁeld theory of the 20th century resulted from a combination of these two point of views. Charges were regarded as sources of the electromagnetic forces (this was the legacy of the charge-interaction point of view) which were considered as propagating through the Maxwellian ﬁeld (this was the legacy of the ﬁeld point of view). The existence of a causal relation between sources and ﬁelds is now universally accepted in electromagnetism: ρ and J (causes) produce the ﬁelds E and B (eﬀects). This relation is clearly expressed by the retarded solutions of Maxwell’s equations in the form of time- dependent extensions of the Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws (in Gaussian units) [3]: E(x, t) = ∫ d3x ′ ρ(x ′, t−R/c) ˆR except because there exist also the so-called advanced solutions of Maxwell’s equations, which can be written as ∫ d3x ′ ρ(x ′, t+R/c) ˆR as a consequence of the motion of charges which was originated by mechanical and not electromagnetic means. This simple example shows that the continuity equation is valid outside the domain of Maxwell’s equations and therefore it should be regarded as a stronger axiom. 7. Concluding remarks R. G. Brown wrote [18]: “... observe that if we take the 4-divergence of both sides of the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations: ∂α∂βFβα = µ0∂αJα = 0 the left hand side vanishes because again, a symmetric diﬀerential operator is contracted with a completely antisym- metric ﬁeld strength tensor. Thus ∂αJα = 0, which, by some strange coincidence, is the charge-current conservation equation in four dimensions. Do you get the feeling that some- thing very deep is going on? This is what I love about physics. Beautiful things are really beautiful!” I think there is no strange coincidence. This is what I love about physics! The beautiful equation ∂αJα = 0 representing charge conservation is the fundamental symmetry behind the inhomogeneous and homogeneous Maxwell equations. “That something very deep” is just charge conservation. To consider the continuity equation as the basic axiom to build the set of equations known as Maxwell’s equations is then a very natural idea. In this paper we have followed this idea by obtaining the covariant form of Maxwell’s equations from the covariant form of the continuity equation. It can be argued that other physical assumptions like the use of the Minkowski spacetime with its speed of light c and its associated retarded Green function G are ingredients im- plicit in the covariant derivation of Maxwell’ equations presented here. However, if we ﬁrst postulate the validity of the continuity equation in any four-space, the particular use of the Minkowski spacetime (together with its associated retarded Green function G and speed c) would not really be a new postulate, but merely an application of our initial postulate. We advocate an axiomatic presentation of Maxwell’s equations in undergraduate and graduate courses of electromagnetism. According to Obradovic [19]: “The axiomatic method oﬀers the shortest way to the essence of any theory, enables its more accurate formulation and more profound and complete interpretation.” In the case of Maxwell’s equations the essence is charge conservation which should be considered the fundamental postulate for an axiomatic presentation of these equations. In the practice, undergraduate instructors can ﬁnd the basis for this presentation in equations (4a) and (4b) of Ref. 2 and 13 graduate instructors in equation (7) of this paper.
