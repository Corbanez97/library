ever since they have ﬁrst been observed. Over the last decade, supernovae gained even more attention, since a subclass – Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) – proved to be a reliable distance estimator. Due to their enormous brightness, these supernovae can be seen out to very large distances, allowing measurements of fundamental cosmological parameters, as described in the introduction to the ﬁeld of Type Ia SNe given in Chapter 2. However, despite of their heavy use, our knowledge about the progenitors and the de- tailed explosion mechanism of supernovae is still quite limited. The deductions for cosmol- ogy thus fully rely on empirical relations found for the light curves of SNe Ia, which lack a detailed explanation by theory at this point. One way to make progress in this situation is to make a strong effort to investigate and analyze the observations in ever more detail. In Chapter 4, an analytic model for the light curve analysis is introduced which follows this strategy. It avoids a-priori assumptions com- monly made and uses ﬁts to observational data to objectively evaluate light curve parame- ters. Therefore, this model is ideally suited to explore the variety among individual SNe Ia and to provide an independent way to look for correlations among parameters of the super- nova light curves. A catalogue of light curve parameters obtained with this method is given in Appendix A. This catalogue is a rich tool for the systematic analysis of SNe Ia light curves and was derived using published light curve data described in Chapter 3. A different approach for putting the empirical relations on a ﬁrmer basis is to try to di- rectly connect theory with observations. Bolometric light curves (Chapter 5) form an impor- tant link between the explosion models and the radiation transport calculations for SNe Ia ejecta. Using simple theoretical modeling, a number of physical parameters of the super- novae can be derived from the bolometric light curves directly. 8 Chapter 2 Type Ia Supernovae 2.1 What are Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)? Supernovae are exploding stars which are characterized by a fast and enormous increase in brightness within a few weeks followed by a fading away during several months. This fading of the SN light (SN 1997cj, a high redshift supernova, as an example) can be seen in Figure 2.1 (Garnavich et al. 1998). Although supernovae are rare events in a single galaxy, systematic SN searches are successful in ﬁnding a fair number of SNe. (For a recent review of observations of Type Ia Supernovae see Leibundgut (2000).) Figure 2.1: The decline of SN 1997cj observed with HST: adapted from Garnavich et al. (1998). In the 1940s it was noticed (Minkowski 1941) that there are at least two different kinds of SNe; supernovae without hydrogen features in their spectra have been categorized as of Type I, those with hydrogen as of Type II. With a growing number and improved quality of observations, the class of Type I SNe had to be subdivided in those with a strong Si II absorption feature (SNe Ia) and those without (SNe Ib and Ic), SNe Ib having prominent He I and SNe Ic neither Si II nor He I features (for more information about SN spectra see Fillipenko (1997)). This classiﬁcation scheme originally being an observational separation according to spectral features has proven to identify physically distinct objects: Type Ia SNe are thermonuclear explosions of low mass stars. All other supernova explosions (Type II and Ib/c) are due to the collapse of massive stars. Type Ia SNe are found also in elliptical galaxies without recent star formation whereas the other types are not. Although there is consensus about SNe Ia being thermonuclear explosions of low mass stars, it is still unclear, what leads to these thermonuclear explosions and how the explosion mechanism can be described. (For a review on models of SNe Ia see e.g. Hillebrandt & Niemeyer (2000).) 10 2 Type Ia Supernovae One possible scenario for the progenitor system is a single carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a tight binary with a stellar companion. When matter is accreted from the companion onto the white dwarf with a rate within a narrow range, the Chandrasekhar mass might be reached, where the degeneracy pressure of the electrons is not able to support the star against gravity. The star collapses. If the accretion rate is too low, the envelope of the star explodes. This phenomenon is called nova and the explosions blow away more matter than has been accreted, making it impossible to reach the critical mass. If the accretion rate is too high, steady quiet hydrogen burning or the build up of a hydrogen rich envelope is possible, which contradicts the fact, that there are no hydrogen features seen in the spectra of SNe Ia. Another ignition scenario is a helium layer built up on top of the carbon-oxygen white dwarf. It can ignite and propagate a burning front into the white dwarf. The compression and heating during the collapse of the star leads to the incineration of the white dwarf and a lot of energy can be gained from burning to the iron-peak and intermediate mass elements (such as Ca, Si, S, Ne, Mg). The star explodes and disrupts the progenitor system. Other models exist in which the companion is another compact object, a white dwarf or neutron star. After merging a compact object with more than the Chandrasekhar mass can form, which also collapses. But these models have problems in reproducing the observed homogeneity of the luminosity at maximum light as the total mass of the two progenitors can vary signiﬁcantly and so do the burning conditions. The ejecta of the supernova are rich in heavy elements, especially 56Ni, which powers the light curve of the supernova during several months with its radioactive decay. Without the input from the radioactive decay, the adiabatic expansion would cool down the debris to invisibility within a short time. In favor of the exploding white dwarf scenario is that there have been no neutron stars found in historical SNe Ia, the appearance of SNe Ia is very homogeneous and the assump- tion of a few tenths of a solar mass of 56Ni ﬁts well the observed light curve and the observed spectra. The different scenarios, however, are not easily distinguishable as they cause only small differences in the observed quantities. Therefore, observations in many wavelength regions and at early epochs are needed. For example the rise times depend on the ejecta opacity and the distribution of 56Ni and thus on the carbon to oxygen ratio. Observing the early light curve thus can give hints on the progenitor, the explosion physics, and the radia- tion transport. SNe Ia show a tremendous homogeneity in their light curves. This has made them very useful for distance estimation, as they can be used as “standard candles”. But careful in- spection of high quality data has proven that there are differences. This is shown in the compilation of SN light curves in Figure 2.2 (taken from Suntzeff 1996). 2.2 Light Curve Width-Luminosity Relation It has been found that the absolute magnitude (for explanations see box on page 11) of SNe Ia is related to the width of the light curve. Earlier versions of such light curve shape vs. lumi- nosity relations had been proposed already in the 1970s, but could not be supported by the available data. After acquiring a lot of high quality data in the early 1990s, the breakthrough came with the Phillips relation (Phillips 1993) in which a linear relationship between the 2.2 Light Curve Width-Luminosity Relation 11 Figure 2.2: BV (left panel) and RI (right panel) evolu- tion of bright SNe Ia. From Suntzeff (1996). The light curves are normalized to the maximum luminosity and to the epoch of maxi- mum light in B. Magnitudes and the distance modulus The absolute magnitude M of an astrophysical object gives its intrinsic brightness in a logarithmic scale. It is deﬁned as M = const. − 2.5 log L, with L being the luminosity in erg/sec and the constant deﬁned such that some normalization requirements are fulﬁlled and it corresponds to the apparent mag- nitude m of an object at a distance of 10 pc (1 pc (parsec) = 3.086 × 10 16 m) after further corrections for reddening and redshift have been taken into account. The apparent ﬂux is not only diminished (the apparent magnitude increased) by the distance modulus, but also by reddening through interstellar dust (see box on page 13) and cosmological redshift (which originates from the expansion of the Universe and shifts the ﬂux to longer wavelengths. The ﬂux in a particular ﬁlter can be diminished or enhanced, de- pending on the ﬂux which is shifted into its wavelength range.): m = M − µ + R E(B–V) + k corr. The distance modulus is the logarithm of the ratios of apparent to absolute luminosities, equal to the differ- ence of absolute magnitude to apparent magnitude. µ ≡ m − M = 5 log r − 5, where r, the luminosity distance, which is deﬁned by the inverse square law, is measured in parsecs. Broadband Filters The light curves are observed typically in the broad-band optical ﬁlters following the Bessell (1990) system. The transmission efﬁciencies for the UBVRIJHK ﬁlters versus wavelength are shown below. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 Wavelength in µm 0.0 0.5 1.0 UB V R I J H K 12 2 Type Ia Supernovae -20 0 20 40 60 t (days since maximum) 41.6 41.8 42.0 42.2 42.4 42.6 42.8 43.0log L (erg/s) 3 2 1 0∆m t –1/2 t +1/2 0.5 Lmax 15 days ∆m15 Figure 2.3: Illustration of the decline parameter ∆m15 denoting the magnitude difference between maximum light and 15 days after and t1/2. t1/2 is the time it takes the SN to rise to (t−1/2) and decline from (t+1/2) maximum to half its luminosity. This parameter will be used for the analysis of bolometric light curves in Chapter 5. linear decline parameter ∆m15 and the absolute magnitude was found. Figure 2.3 illustrates this parameter together with the half light width t 1/2 (the time it takes the SN to rise to and decline from maximum to half its luminosity), a light curve shape parameter which will be used for the analysis of bolometric light curves in Chapter 5. Employing the observed correlation between light curve shape and luminosity improved the precision of distance estimates derived from SNe Ia signiﬁcantly and allowed using SNe Ia for the determination of cosmological parameters. The success can be seen best in the Hubble diagram (see box on page 14), where the distribution around a straight line nar- rows signiﬁcantly, when brightness corrections depending on this width luminosity relation are applied. For the luminosity correction mainly three different implementations are used: The template-ﬁtting method (Hamuy et al. 1996c): The decline rate parameter ∆m15(B) and the magnitude at maximum are determined from the comparison of the goodness of ﬁts of the photometric data to a set of template SN Ia light curves. These template light curves are chosen to span the full range of observed decline rates. The magnitude at maximum light is corrected to a standard value using a linear (now extended to a quadratic (Phillips et al. 1999)) relation between the decline rate and maximum lumi- 2.2 Light Curve Width-Luminosity Relation 13 nosity gained from supernovae in the Hubble ﬂow, which have also been corrected for extinction. It is important to notice, that although this method often is referenced as the “∆m 15 method” the parameter is not determined directly from the magnitude difference of the ﬁrst 15 days past maximum of the observations, but from the ﬁt to pre- and post- maximum light data out to 40 days past maximum. Also the ﬁt is done simultaneously in more than one ﬁlter band, depending on the availability of observations. The stretch factor method (Perlmutter et al. 1997, 1999): It was found, that if the B light cur- ves of SNe Ia are stretched or contracted in time, they overlay. This is used in the stretch factor method, where a template light curve is stretched to match the observed light curve. The width luminosity relation has been derived using the light curves of the Cal´an/Tololo supernovae. The multicolor light curve shape method (MLCS, Riess et al. 1998): The third approach is a quadratic estimation algorithm to determine the relationship between the shape of the light curve and its peak luminosity. A training set of SNe in the Hubble ﬂow is used to calibrate this method. And depending on the purpose of the brightness correction two or more ﬁlters are used to estimate the extinction due to the host galaxy of the SN. Figure 2.4 shows the luminosity–width relation as Phillips et al. (1999) ﬁnd it. In the left half of the ﬁgure the absolute magnitudes corrected only for Galactic reddening (see box on page 13) for their full sample in the Hubble ﬂow is shown. In the right half 23 SNe in their sample are eliminated because of signiﬁcant host galaxy reddening. A clear correlation and the need for a second order term can be seen. Some SNe are peculiar and do not ﬁt into this picture: e.g. SNe 1991T and 1991bg. They are not in Figure 2.4, because they are not in the Hubble ﬂow. Not only do they show unusual Reddening Intervening dust in the host galaxy of the supernova and in our Galaxy is absorbing and scattering the light of the supernova. Therefore the light is reddened and dimmed. Comparing the colors of reddened and unreddened stars, the color excess E(B–V) =(B–V) − (B–V)0 can be obtained. From spectrophotometric measurements it was found, that the interstellar extinction Aλ is proportional to 1/λ. In this work the conventional extinction law of Savage & Mathis (1979) is used for correcting the supernova light for interstellar extinction. Galactic reddening Reddening occuring in our Galaxy depends on the direction to the supernova. Used here are the dust maps of Schlegel et al. (1998), which are based on measuring the dust infrared emission with instruments on the IRAS and COBE satellites. Since the diffuse emission in the infrared is a direct measure of the column density of the interstellar dust, such a map can be used as a measure of extinction for extragalactic objects. Host galaxy reddening The light coming from a supernova can already be reddened in its host galaxy. For estimating the ex- tinction by the host galaxy either the color at maximum or the color evolution of the supernova can be used (see explanation in Section 3.2). Furthermore the intensity of interstellar absorption bands is well correlated with the extinction measured by the color excess E(B–V). The equivalent width of the Na I D line at the redshift of the host galaxy thus can be used for the reddening estimation. 14 2 Type Ia Supernovae spectral features, colors and belong to the brightest resp. faintest SNe Ia, but often they show up as outliers in relations. What determines the light curve shape? The light curve of a SN Ia is determined by a competition between three effects: the deposi- tion of energy from radioactive decay, the adiabatic conversion of internal energy to kinetic energy of expansion, and the escape of internal energy as the observed light curve. The de- posited energy stems from the γ–rays of the electron capture processes of 56Ni and 56Co and the kinetic energy of the positrons, which are generated in 19% of the 56Co decay, and their annihilation γ–rays (this will be discussed in detail in Section 5.3.1). The 56Ni yield and the γ–ray escape fraction play the determining roles in the relation between the light curve’s width and peak luminosity, whereas models are quite insensitive to the distribution of radioactivity and to the composition of non-radioactive material, within limits set by achieving the appropriate explosion energies and acceptable nucleosynthesis (Pinto & Eastman 2001). The peak luminosity and the heating rate of the gas are determined by the amount of 56Ni. The more 56Ni is synthesized, the higher are the temperatures and the cooling is less efﬁcient, a higher ionization being responsible for this. This leads to broader and brighter light curves. If the efﬁciency of the γ–ray escape is increased, the evolution rate of the light curve is in- creased and the greater escape leads to narrower light curves. As SNe with synthesized 56Ni extending to higher velocities or higher overall velocities have larger γ–ray escape fractions at a given time, they have narrower light curves. Models with higher 56Ni yields tend to have their radioactivity distributed over a broader range in velocity, leading to larger escape fractions. This greater escape fraction acts to oppose the tendency for broader light curves resulting from higher temperatures. Thus these two effects are not independent. Pinto & Eastman (2001) have shown that they can reproduce the observed width luminosity relation with only varying the 56Ni yield. Analyzing the light curves of SNe Ia can yield insight in the progenitor system, the explo- sion mechanism, and the radiation transport. By comparing the kinetic energy as derived from line widths and the measured amount of 56Ni it should be possible to derive global parameters of the explosion. Hubble diagram and Hubble ﬂow The Hubble diagram shows distance vs. redshift. The law that recessional speed is proportional to distance for a homogeneous and isotropic Universe is called Hubble law. Galaxies moving away from us with a speed precisely following this law are said to follow the Hubble ﬂow. Because the actual Universe is not precisely homogeneous, with lumpiness arising from clustering of galaxies and voids of empty space, the motions of nearby galaxies deviate somewhat from the Hubble ﬂow. High redshift supernovae deviate from the straight line (Hubble law) because higher orders of the redshift dependence have to be taken into account. In the case of supernovae the distance modulus can be measured, if the absolute magnitude is known. The absolute magnitude is derived from the apparent magnitude considering reddening and correcting with the width-luminosity relation. The redshift is measured from the shift of lines in the observed spec- trum. Comparing the observational data with theoretical lines leads to a determination of cosmological parameters, its geometry and mass-energy content. 2.3 High Redshift SNe and their Use as Distance Indicators 15 1.0 1.5 2.0 −20 −19 −18 −17 −20 −19 −18 −17Mmax − 5log(Ho/65) −20 −19 −18 −17 1.0 1.5 2.0 B V I B V II ∆m15(B)obs Figure 2.4: Figure from Phillips et al.

Right: Same diagram after elimination of the 23 SNe in the sample for which they ﬁnd signiﬁcant host galaxy reddening. The dashed lines correspond to the linear ﬁts given by Hamuy et al. (1996c). 2.3 High Redshift SNe and their Use as Distance Indicators Assuming that SNe are standard candles (Branch & Tammann 1992) or that their maximum luminosity can be corrected with the luminosity width relation (see Section 2.2), the lumi- nosity distance can be calculated. Together with the redshift of the SN, it can be put in the Hubble diagram (see box on page 14). Two independent groups are searching for SNe at high redshifts (0.5 ≲ z ≲ 1.2) at the moment (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). These redshifts are in the non-linear re- gions of the Hubble ﬂow and allow to distinguish different cosmologies. Systematically sur- veying patches of the sky searching for SNe at high redshift together with pre-scheduled follow-up observations within large collaborations with access to the biggest telescopes made it possible to collect data of more than 100 high redshift supernovae up to now. The two groups use different methods to correct for the width luminosity relation, but still draw the same conclusions. 16 2 Type Ia Supernovae Supernova Cosmology Project 34 36 38 40 42 44 W M =0.3, W L =0.7 W M =0.3, W L =0.0 W M =1.0, W L =0.0m-M (mag) High-Z SN Search Team 0.01 0.10 1.00 z Figure 2.5: Hubble diagram for high and low redshift SNe (Riess et al. 1998) from both groups (symbols). The distance moduli are measured from the template-ﬁtting method parameterized by ∆m15(B) (Hamuy et al. 1996c). Overplotted are three cosmologies: “low” and “high” Ω M with ΩΛ = 0 and the best ﬁt for a ﬂat cosmology, ΩM = 0.3 with ΩΛ = 0.7. The determination of cosmological parameters (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) has induced a vivid discussion in cosmology (for a review see Riess (2000)). The distant SNe are too dim for a matter dominated, ﬂat or open Universe. This faintness can be interpreted as a greater than expected distance, resulting from an accelerating, ever expanding Universe. This result implies the existence of a new constituent of the Universe, either the cosmolog- ical constant or something else with similarly negative pressure capable of accelerating the expansion (“dark energy”). Both groups take care of excluding systematic contaminations of the observations. The so-called Malmquist-bias (only detecting the brightest SNe), gravitational lensing and sam- ple contamination have been tested, but none of these effects can make the data compatible with a decelerating Universe. Extinction by interstellar dust and evolution of the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia or a change in the population of SNe Ia could bias the results. Dust has a different signature than an accelerated Universe. Normal dust grains show 2.3 High Redshift SNe and their Use as Distance Indicators 17 up not only as extinction but also as a color excess as it preferentially extinguishes bluer light. Both groups observe in at least two ﬁlters (restframe B and V). The color excess for the high redshift SNe is consistent with zero color excess in both samples. But even assum- ing a “worst-case” plausible color excess is not enough to disfavor an accelerating Universe. So called “grey” dust, which reddens less than normal dust, could extinguish enough light to again favor a non-accelerating Universe. If the grey dust is patchy like normal dust, it would increase the scatter of the observations further than by the measurement uncertain- ties, but this is not seen in the measurements. The other possibility would be uniformly distributed grey dust. If it is not perfectly grey, measurements in a wider wavelength range (restframe UBVRI) could measure it, observations are underway (Jha & the High-Z Super- nova Search Team 2001). Also observations at higher redshift (z > 1) can distinguish dim- ming by dust and other systematic effects from the faintness because of cosmology. Whereas systematic effects can be assumed to grow with redshift, the most favored model at the mo- ment has its biggest deviation from an empty Universe at a redshift around 1. So far there is no indication that SNe Ia observed at high redshift are different from the low redshift sample, as their light curves and spectra show a strong similarity. But further observations especially in restframe U, where variations in the progenitors are predicted to lead to observable effects, might strengthen this assumption. Also observations in the IR are made to check, if SNe at high redshift show the secondary maximum seen in longer wavelength ﬁlters in the nearby sample. 18 Chapter 3 Observational Data 3.1 Light Curve Data For this work published light curves of 60 SNe have been compiled. The references for these light curves and the availability of the ﬁlter light curves are listed in the second and third column of Table 3.1. 3.2 Reddening Before constructing the bolometric light curves (Chapter 5) the ﬁlter light curves had to be dereddened. Reddening by dust affects the absolute luminosity as well as the spectral energy distribution. The color excess due to Galactic reddening (Schlegel et al. 1998) is listed in the forth column in Table 3.1. To have a consistent data set, the values of Phillips et al. (1999) are used for the host galaxy dust extinction where available. They use information about the color at maximum and the fact, that the B–V evolution during the period from 30 to 90 days after V maximum is remarkably similar for all events. The sixth column lists the color excess E(B–V) (Phillips et al. 1999) and the seventh column gives the sum of the two color excesses. For four SNe other sources for the color excess had to be used, as they are not included in the Phillips et al. (1999) sample: The color excess of SN 1996ab was estimated by Riess (2001) using the multicolor light curve shape method described in Section 2.2. For SN 1997br the value by Li et al. (1999) has been used. In the case of SN 1997cn Turatto et al. (1998) state that there is no absorption in the host galaxy. Modjaz et al. (2001) ﬁnd for SN 1998de that there is no Na I absorption and the SN is in the outskirts of a lenticular galaxy, where no absorption is expected. The total color excesses of these SNe are given in column seven. 3.3 Distances The distance to the SN is the major uncertainty in the calculation of the bolometric luminos- ity (see Section 5.1), but the distance scale just shifts the light curves and does not alter the light curve shape. As local SNe as well as SNe in the Hubble ﬂow have been included in the analysis, different distance estimators had to be used (Column eight in Table 3.1 and refer- ence in column nine). For an overview on techniques for measuring extragalactic distances 20 3 Observational Data see Jacoby et al. (1992). To have as uniform as possible a set of distances, all distances have been converted to a distance scale of H0 = 65 km s−1 Mpc−1. The distances for the SNe from the Riess et al. (1999c) sample are derived from the he- liocentric velocities given in Riess et al. (1999c), which are converted to cosmic microwave background (CMB) velocities. Hamuy et al. (1996c) give already the heliocentric velocities to the host galaxies corrected to the cosmic microwave background frame. For the nearby SNe Cepheid, Tully-Fisher, and SBF distances have been used. Calculat- ing the distance with the method of the globular cluster luminosity function (Drenkhahn & Richtler 1999; Della Valle et al. 1998) for SNe 1994D and 1992A reveals the same values within the uncertainties.

(2001) Chapter 4 Fitting Routine 4.1 Method To avoid assumptions made in template ﬁtting methods the light curves are analyzed in- dividually using a descriptive model (Vacca & Leibundgut 1996). For each supernova the observed light curve in each ﬁlter (in magnitudes, for an explanation see box on page 2.2) is ﬁtted with an empirical model consisting of a Gaussian (for the peak phase) atop a lin- ear decay (late-time decline), a second Gaussian (to model the secondary maximum in the V, R, and I band light curves), and an exponentially rising function (for the pre-maximum segment). The functional form of the ﬁt is: m = f0 + γ(t − t0)+ g0 exp [ −(t−t0)2 2σ2 0 ] + g1 exp [ −(t−t1)2 2σ2 1 ] 1 − exp ( τ−t θ ) . (4.1) The ﬁrst Gaussian and the decline are normalized to the phase t0, while the second Gaus- sian occurs at a later phase t1. The exponential cutoff function for the rise has a characteristic time θ and a separate phase zero-point τ. The amplitudes of the two Gaussians, g 0 and g1, as well as the intercept of the line, f0, the slope, γ, the phases t 0 and t1, and the widths, σ0 and σ1, the characteristic rise time θ and its phase τ are free parameters in the ﬁt. Each ﬁlter light curve is ﬁtted individually and independently using a χ2-minimization procedure to determine the best-ﬁt values of the parameters. Other parameters which characterize the shape of the light curve, such as the time of maximum brightness or ∆m15 (see Figure 2.3 for an illustration), can then be derived from the best-ﬁt model. Although the model is a com- pletely empirical description of the general shape of SNe Ia light curves, it can be noted that theoretical models (Pinto & Eastman 2000) predict a Gaussian shape for the peak in models with constant opacity and 56Ni buried well within the ejecta. Furthermore, the late decline of the SNe Ia ﬂux, particulary in the B and V bands, often appears quasi-exponential. This justiﬁes the linear decline in magnitude. Figure 4.1 shows the example of the ﬁt to the R light curve of SN 1992bc (photometry from Hamuy et al. 1996c). The various components of the ﬁt are displayed. The exponential function (solid line) rises steeply to unity, modeling the rapid brightness increase of the supernova. The decline rate (dotted line) is set by the long tail beginning about 50 days past maximum. The ﬁrst Gaussian (dashed line) fully describes the maximum phase, as further demonstrated in the inset. The second Gaussian (dashed-dotted line) reproduces 24 4 Fitting Routine 19 18 17 16 15mR 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 8900 8905 8910 8915 8920 8925 8930 16.4 16.2 16.0 15.8 15.6 15.4 15.2 15 days ∆m15 8900 8920 8940 8960 8980 9000 9020 9040 t (JD 2440000 + ) 0.05 0.00 -0.05 -0.10residuals Figure 4.1: Fit of Equation 4.1 to the R photometry of SN 1992bc.

The inset shows the light curve around maximum light. ∆m15 can be obtained easily because of the con- tinuous representation of the data by the ﬁt. The residuals from the ﬁt are displayed in the bottom panel with the observational error bars. the “bump” in the light curve. The bottom panel of Figure 4.1 displays the residuals of the ﬁt with the observational error bars. It is clear that the function is an accurate, continuous description of the data. The small systematic undulations of the residuals indicate that the ﬁt is not perfect and can be used to make detailed comparisons between individual supernovae. This model has been ﬁtted to the ﬁlter light curves of 60 supernovae. These ﬁts and the ﬁt parameters are presented in Appendix A. The ﬁts provide objective measures of the magnitude (m max) and date (tmax) of maxi- mum, the extent of the peak phase, the amplitude and extent of the secondary peak, the late decline rate, and an estimate of the rise time. The accuracy of these parameters de- pends strongly on the number and quality of the observations in each phase.

The description of the lines is given in Figure 4.1. cases the late decline can be derived fairly easily, the rise time is undetermined when no pre-maximum observations are available. It is possible to derive other light curve shape de- scriptions, such as ∆m15, for each ﬁlter objectively and independently without comparing it to templates. Other functional forms could be imagined for the ﬁt. However, the late decline and the steep rise can be assumed to have simple functional forms. Fitting polynomials or spline functions, for example, could not produce the transition to the linear decline as observed, but would simply transfer the undulations of the early phases to the late decline and fail to match the observed linear decline. Furthermore, such functions would not provide a small set of adjustable parameters which can be compared between different objects. Nevertheless, the adopted functional form is not a perfect representation of all optical ﬁlter light curves. When ﬁtting the I light curves of some SNe Ia it is found that the model has difﬁculties to match the observations with the same accuracy as in the other ﬁlters. This can be seen in Figure 4.2. The slope of the I band light curve decline (dotted line) is so steep that the model can- 26 4 Fitting Routine not reproduce the observed light curve. This steep slope causes the function to overshoot the observed values near the second maximum and the ﬁtting program inverts the second Gaussian to produce the observed minimum in the light curve. If the ﬁtting routine is con- strained to ﬁt only positive Gaussians (positive in ﬂux, i.e. negative in magnitudes), the exponential rising function (solid line) is shifted to late times and depresses the linear de- cay (dotted line) before the second maximum; in addition the ﬁrst Gaussian (dashed line) is enhanced and shifted to earlier times. This implies that, for the I band, the ﬁt parameters describing the ﬁrst Gaussian (i.e. its magnitude, its center and its standard deviation) cannot be used to characterize the ﬁrst maximum, even if the light curve appears ﬁtted well. In spite of this problem, the I band light curves of the SNe in the analyzed sample can all be reasonably well ﬁtted with the model and the descriptive parameters derived from these ﬁts are meaningful. This steep decline in the I band is a rather unexpected result. The physical explanation behind this behavior is that the I ﬁlter light curve is dominated by a rapidly decreasing ﬂux component and signiﬁcant ﬂux redistribution takes place in the evolution. Similar results have been found by Suntzeff (1996) in the observations of SN 1992A and by Pinto & Eastman (2000) in theoretical models. If there are no observations in the time range of one component of the ﬁt, this can result in strange features of the ﬁts. For example, the light curves of SN 1990N (see Figure A.2) suffer from two gaps in the observations, one being at the time where the secondary maximum is expected, which makes the ﬁt overestimating the second maximum in the ﬁlter light curves by far. This has as a result that also the secondary bump in the bolometric light curve is inﬂated. The applied method is a Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (see Bevington & Robinson 1992; Press et al. 1992; Davis 1993) to minimize χ2 for a nonlinear ﬁt. This method com- bines the advantages of a gradient-search method with those of an expansion method. In gradient-search methods the parameters of the ﬁt are changed simultaneously, so that the resultant direction of travel in parameter space is along the gradient of χ2. This makes it a fast method while far away from the minimum, but it looses efﬁciency as the search ap- proaches a minimum, because the evaluation of the derivative involves taking differences between nearly equal numbers. Also it has a good chance to end up in long, ﬂat valleys in the parameter space. The second ingredient to the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is the expansion method as soon as the approximation comes close enough to the minimum, that the deviations caused by the linearization do not introduce a big error. The Levenberg– Marquardt method has the advantage of being reasonably insensitive to the starting values of the parameters, it provides an estimate of the full error matrix and a better calculation of the diagonal errors. Although the method is reasonably insensitive to the starting values in general, the mul- titude of 10 parameters can cause the ﬁt to end up in a local minimum far away from reason- able parameters. Therefore the initial values of the parameters are varied within the ranges given in Table 4.1 and the output of the ﬁt is checked, if the parameters are in the range of reasonable values. The resultant parameters of the ﬁt have to be within the following ranges: f0 has to be between −10 and 30, 30 being an upper limit of apparent magnitude and −10 allowing also normalized (mmax = 0) light curves to be ﬁtted. The slope γ is required to be declining (> 0) and smaller than 1 mag/day. The two Gaussians have amplitudes g0/1 between 0 and −8 magnitudes, standard deviations σ0/1 between 0.5 and 50 days and times in the range of −20 to 20 or −20 to 50 days past the input value tini 0 for t0/1 respectively. 4.1 Method 27 Table 4.1: Range of parameters as input in the ﬁtting routine and for checking the output. initial range ﬁnal range f0 [mag] 10 . . . 20 −10 . . . 30 γ [mag/day] 0.002 . . . 0.040 0 ... 1 g0 [mag] −5.1 . . . 0.1 −8 ... 0 t0 [days] tini 0 − 10 ... tini 0 + 10 tini 0 − 20 ... tini 0 + 20 σ0 [mag] 0.1 . . . 30.1 0.5 . . . 50 g1 [mag] −5.1 . . . 0.1 −8 ... 0 t1 [days] tini 0 + 12 ... tini 0 + 32 tini 0 − 20 ... tini 0 + 50 σ1 [mag] 0.1 . . . 30.1 0.5 . . . 50 τ [days] tini 0 − 30 ... tini 0 − 10 −100 . . . t0 θ [days] 1 ... 10 1 ... 20 The asymptotic value for the exponenial rise has to be before t 0, otherwise it would damp the light curve in an unacceptable way and past day −100 (to allow enough time for the rise even for normalized (tmax = 0) light curves). A reasonable range for the steepness of the exponential rise is between 1 and 20 days. 10000 sets of initial parameters have been chosen and the number of accepted ﬁts (accord- ing to the criteria above: the ﬁt parameters resulting from the calculations is in the range of the last column of Table 4.1) averages to about 33% in B for the whole sample of 60 SNe; for the V band one gets 24%, for the R band 15% and 12% for I. But the standard deviations of these values can be of the same order and the rejection rate has a big variation in the su- pernova sample. For the U band no statistical statement can be made because of the small number of available light curves. χ2 of the non-rejected values is a continuous function and as 10000 iterations are taken, even with an rejection rate of 90% enough parameter sets are calculated to get this contin- uous representation of χ2 (also of small χ2s). Also within the non-rejected parameter sets there are enough parameter sets with χ2 < 10. This does not hold for most I light curves, as for the I band the χ2 distribution can be very broad as, as explained above, the minima of the χ2 hypersurface are broad and numerous. The distribution of best χ2 can be used as a measurement of reliability of the ﬁt parameters. But as already stressed above, this doesn’t mean that the ﬁt itself was not reliable. The value of χ2 also depends on the number of ob- servations, therefore a small χ2 can be the result of a strong determination of the ﬁt because there are not many more observations than ﬁt parameters. To test the dependence of the ﬁt on the number and distribution of data points artiﬁcial light curves were constructed. The ﬁtted light curves of the B and I band of SN 1992bc were chosen as examples of light curves with and without a secondary bump. From these light curves 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 epochs have been chosen uniformly distributed within −10 and 92.3 days of B maximum. Normal distributed noise with σ = 0.05 mag has been added to the brightness and these newly-created data pairs are again ﬁt with the ﬁtting routine. This has been done for a sample of 10 light curves for each sampling of epochs given above. The variations in the ﬁt parameters and derived parameters depending on the number of epochs show where the problem in the ﬁtting method is posed. For the small number of 8 epochs randomly spaced in the range of more than 100 days the light curves can not be 28 4 Fitting Routine reproduced. The ﬁt parameters f 0 and γ, which enter the ﬁt linearly, give approximately the same results from 32 datapoints upwards, whereas the ﬁt parameters with non-linear dependence require more datapoints. The derived parameters, t max, mmax, ∆m15 show a fast convergence with number. But for example the Gaussians, which are described by 3 parameters, have to be determined by at least as many observations as parameters in the relevant time interval. This is not the case for only 16 datapoints (if they are spread over the whole interval of 100 days as calculated here). In practice there will be more observations around peak than in these calculations, where the late slope, which could be determined from 2 observations is overdetermined. The rise of the light curve is underdetermined in the majority of cases. This makes the ﬁt parameters τ and θ and t rise varying much from representation to representation. The tests described here have not been extensive enough to make quantitative statements about the ﬁtting method in general, but in the next section the derivation of errors will be given for the ﬁtting parameters as well as for the derived parameters. 4.2 Error Estimates with Monte Carlo Techniques The ﬁtting procedure provides an estimate of the goodness of ﬁt, as well as the associated uncertainties on the ﬁt parameters. Uncertainties on the derived quantities depend strongly on the quality and number of data points. If there are no data before 5 days prior to maxi- mum, e.g., the rise time cannot be determined reliably. The uncertainties of the derived parameters have been estimated using a Monte Carlo method (see Press et al. 1992). Synthetic data sets have been constructed with the same tem- poral sampling as the observed light curve. The magnitude at each point was computed from the best ﬁt model, with the assumption of a Gaussian probability distribution whose width was given by the observational uncertainty. The standard deviations of the observed data points range from 0.03 to 0.14 magnitudes. In this manner, 1000 synthetic data sets were simulated. Each synthetic data set was ﬁt and the frequency distribution for each model parameter was constructed. Two examples of the resulting distributions (the time of B maximum tmax and the B magnitude at maximum mmax for SN 1992bc) are shown as histograms in Figure 4.3. The value of the best ﬁt and the mean of the distribution are dis- played as vertical dotted and solid lines respectively. The differences between the mean and the best ﬁt is less than 0.015 days for the time of maximum and less than 0.001 magnitudes for the peak brightness. In this example the skewness and kurtosis are negligible. Non-zero values of skewness and kurtosis provide an indication of the unreliability of the derived ﬁt parameters (see e.g. Figure 4.6). The uncertainties for the light curve parameters given by the Monte Carlo simulations are shown in Table A.2. Occasionally the standard deviations obtained for a ﬁt parameter from the ﬁtting pro- cedure differed signiﬁcantly from the values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations. This arises because the standard deviations derived from the ﬁt are calculated from the di- agonal elements of the curvature matrix, while the standard deviations derived from the Monte Carlo simulations result from actual frequency distributions. Both standard devia- tions should be the same for a perfect light curve, i.e. well sampled data, where the bright- ness differs from the analytical shape of the light curve by only a small error. The code has been conﬁrmed with this test (using artiﬁcial data points, which have been created from a set of ﬁt parameters, equally spaced, enough of them (200), deviating only with a stan- 4.2 Error Estimates with Monte Carlo Techniques 29 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ∆t (days) 0 100 200 300n 8912.88 0.20 8912.87 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 ∆m 0 100 200 300 15.18 0.01 15.18 Figure 4.3: The distribution of the time of B maximum tmax and the B magnitude at max- imum mmax for SN 1992bc as calculated from Monte Carlo simulations of 1000 synthetic data sets as described in the text.

The mean of the distribution does not de- viate signiﬁcantly from the input value and the standard deviation of the distribution is very small in all cases. 30 4 Fitting Routine f0 -0.015 -0.010 -0.0050 0.0 0.0050 0.010 0.015 +12.6 (mag) 0 100 200 300 400 12.5999 0.00360003 12.6 γ -1.0e-05 -5.0e-06 0.0 5.0e-06 1.0e-05 +0.033 (mag/day) 0 200 400 600 800 0.0330000 2.51141e-06 0.033 g0 -0.040 -0.020 0.0 0.020 0.040 -1.0 (mag) 0 100 200 300 400 -1.00033 0.00970721 -1.0 t0 -0.60 -0.40 -0.20 0.0 0.20 0.40 0.60 +431.0 (JD) 0 100 200 300 400 430.998 0.108237 431.0 σ0 -0.30 -0.20 -0.10 0.0 0.10 0.20 0.30 +10.0 (days) 0 100 200 300 400 10.0008 0.0658810 10.0 g1 -0.0060 -0.0040 -0.0020 0.0 0.0020 0.0040 0.0060 -0.5 (mag) 0 100 200 300 400 500 -0.500015 0.00108803 -0.5 t1 -0.060 -0.040 -0.020 0.0 0.020 0.040 0.060 +454.0 (JD) 0 100 200 300 400 454.000 0.0125530 454.0 σ1 -0.040 -0.020 0.0 0.020 0.040 +5.50 (days) 0 100 200 300 400 5.50003 0.00930707 5.50 τ -0.40 -0.20 0.0 0.20 0.40 +411.0 (JD) 0 100 200 300 400 410.998 0.109126 411.0 θ -0.30 -0.20 -0.10 0.0 0.10 0.20 0.30 +5.40 (days) 0 100 200 300 400 5.40176 0.0767025 5.40 tmax -0.030 -0.020 -0.010 0.0 0.010 0.020 0.030 + 432.12256 (JD) 0 100 200 300 400 432.123 0.00647278 432.12256 mmax -0.0015 -0.0010 -0.00050 0.0 0.00050 0.0010 0.0015 + 11.880864 (mag) 0 100 200 300 400 11.8809 0.000343439 11.880864 Figure 4.4: Distribution (histograms) of the 10 ﬁt parameters and of tmax and mmax as calculated with the Monte Carlo simulations as described in the text.

The U band appears to rise faster than the B band, although the limited number of objects (5 supernovae) precludes any deﬁnitive state- ments. The V light curve clearly peaks some time after the B maximum for all observed SNe Ia. This behavior is more or less expected from models of an expanding cooling atmo- sphere (Arnett 1982), as indicated by the lines in Figure 4.5.

The I histogram is very broad but for most objects the rise in I is clearly faster than in B. This trend is further continued in the JHK light curves which all peak before B (Elias et al. 1985; Leibundgut 1988; Meikle 2000; Meikle & Hernandez 2000). The early appearance of the peak in the infrared rules out the idea of an expanding, cooling sphere in the analyzed time range. The SN with tV − tB = 4.25 is SN 1997br where there are no observations around max- imum light for 6 days, making it difﬁcult to determine the time and magnitude of the max- imum. The calculated uncertainties nevertheless are small because the ﬁt is determined by the amount of observations before and after peak. The SN with tI − tB = 5.10 is SN 1998de which exhibits, like SN 1991bg, no secondary bump and is underluminous. Whereas for SN 1991bg the observations in B started after maximum, SN 1998de is well observed around maximum. Its I maximum is not only very late compared to B maximum, but also relative to V and R compared to SN 1991bg. If the Spearman rank-order correlation coefﬁcient (see e.g. Press et al. 1992,Chapter 14) for the epochs of maximum light is calculated, it can be seen, that earlier I and R maximum means later U maximum (only 4 SNe). The times of maximum in I and R as well as in I and V show a correlation (with the correlation coefﬁcient being 0.75 at a high signiﬁcance). So do the times of maximum in the bolometric and I light curve, whereas there is no correlation between the other bands. 4.4 Rise Times As the high redshift data of SNe Ia have given evidence for an accelerating universe (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) the calibrated standard candles have to be tested thor- oughly, because evolution (if combined with a change in the peak luminosity of SNe Ia) might account for the observed faintness of high redshift SNe. One light curve parame- ter which is examined to check for systematic effects is the rise time, i.e. the time between explosion and maximum luminosity of the SN. A ﬁrst comparison of observations of nearby and high-z SNe (Riess et al. 1999a,b) has shown a 5.8σ difference between the rise times of the low redshift data and a preliminary analysis of high redshift data. The high redshift data have shorter rise times by 2.4 days. But a more thorough analysis of the data (Aldering et al. 2000) has shown, that the discrepancy with the low redshift rise times is about 2σ or less. The ﬁrst analysis underestimated the uncertainties in both the low and high redshift sample. But even if the rise times at high and low redshift differ, this not necessarily implies a difference in peak magnitude, because the light curves of the SNe may differ only in the ﬁrst few days after the explosion, if the conditions vary only near the outer part of the exploding white dwarf. In the analysis of Riess et al. (1999b) the rise time was calculated in ﬁtting a t2 model (with tr denoting the rise time and a scale factor α) to the premaximum part of the light curve: L = α(t + tr)2. (4.2) Shortly after explosion a SN Ia can be theoretically represented as an expanding ﬁreball. A t2 model can be justiﬁed under the conditions of uniform expansion and constant effective temperature from simple physics (see also Arnett 1982). 34 4 Fitting Routine B -2 0 2 ∆t (days) 0 100 200 300n -17.59 0.79 -17.51 R -2 0 2 ∆t (days) 0 100 200 300 -19.80 1.04 -19.50 Figure 4.6: The distribution of the rise time parameter in B and R for SN 1994D as calcu- lated from Monte Carlo simulations of 1000 synthetic data sets as described in Section 4.2. Our approach to derive the rise time is different. With the method described above the rise time is deﬁned as the time it takes for the SN to increase the magnitude from 30 mag below maximum to maximum brightness (this rise corresponds to the typical increase in luminosity from a white dwarf to a SN). As the rise of the SN light curve is ﬁtted with an exponential function and as already described in Section 4.1 problems in ﬁtting the too steep late decline together with the non availability of early light curve data makes the uncertainty of the rise time quite large. The exponential function also has to make the maximum non- symmetric. This behaviour can be seen in Figure 4.6 where the distribution of the rise time in B and R for SN 1994D as calculated from Monte Carlo simulations (see Section 4.2) are dis- played as histograms. A Gaussian distribution with the same mean and standard deviation is plotted for comparison. Whereas the distribution of the B band rise time is quite narrow and symmetric, the distribution of the R band rise time is asymmetric. The late decline in the R band is much steeper than in B, which results in a stronger inﬂuence of the post-maximum data on the pre-maximum rise. Therefore the rise times calculated with the model described in this work are only reliable for a few SNe, where there are early pre-maximum observa- tions and the post-maximum evolution does not require the exponentially rising function to adjust because of the ﬁt past maximum. The comparison of different derivations of the rise time of a Type Ia supernova is shown in Figure 4.7. The chosen example is the B light curve of SN 1994D. The diamonds are the data from Richmond et al. (1995), which were used for the determination of the rise time with the method described in Section 4.1 (solid line).

Including three more data points shifts the rise time by 0.4 days. The differences in the methods to derive the rise times can be seen best in units of magnitude (c). The t2-ﬁts are approaching zero level ﬂux at the rise time, whereas the exponential ﬁt for the pre-maximum rise is rising much slower. As already mentioned above, the ﬁt to the pre-maximum rise with the method described in this work is also affected by the post-maximum ﬁt because the exponential rise also has to dim the exponential decline, if the slope is too steep.

For the t 2-ﬁt incorporating the data till day -6 extends the rise time by 0.4 days, which gets closer to the quoted results in Riess et al. (1999b). The vertical dotted line is the rise time they get for the direct ﬁt to Equation 4.2, the long dashed and the dashed dotted vertical lines denote the rise times calculated from the ﬁts in Riess et al. (1999b) with the decline rate and the multicolor light curve shape (MLCS) methods respectively. For the range of 6 magnitudes below maximum light (d) the differences in the methods are still small. The two SNe both included in our sample and in Riess et al. (1999b), are SN 1990N and SN 1994D. In Table 4.3 the rise times of the B and V light curves of the SNe 1990N and 1994D are given. The rows labelled t2 give the values calculated from the tables in Riess et al. (1999b) either using the MLCS or decline rate parameters or the direct ﬁt they quote in their discussion section. Comparing these numbers to the rise times we get for the exponential ﬁt (rows 4 and 5) it can be seen, that the rise time of SN 1990N is several days longer for the exponential ﬁt, if the unﬁltered observations published in Riess et al. (1999b) are included. If they are not included, the light curve ﬁt for SN 1990N is steeper leading to a shorter rise time. As already shown in Figure 4.7 the exponential ﬁt to the light curve of SN 1994D is slower than the t2 ﬁt; the rise times are about 1 day longer. This comparison together with Figure 4.7 has shown the problems of determining the rise time with the analytical ﬁt. Especially if the post-maximum decline requires the exponential rise to dim the light curve, the rise often is too slow, leading to an overestimation of the rise time. Chapter 5 Bolometric Light Curves 5.1 Method and Uncertainties The ﬂux emitted by a SN Ia in the UV, optical, and IR wavelength range, the so-called “UVOIR bolometric ﬂux”, traces the radiation converted from the radioactive decays of newly synthesized isotopes. As nearly 80% of the bolometric luminosity of a typical SN Ia is emitted in the range from 3000 to 10000 ˚A (Suntzeff 1996), the integrated ﬂux in the UBVRI pass bands provides a reliable measure of the bolometric luminosity and therefore repre- sents a physically meaningful quantity. This luminosity depends directly on the amount of nickel produced in the explosion, the energy deposition, and the γ–ray escape, but not on the exact wavelengths of the emitted photons. The ﬁts of the ﬁlter light curves in the UBVRI pass bands have been used to construct an optical bolometric light curve for the SNe in the sample of Table 3.1. For the analysis all objects with well-sampled light curves at least in three pass bands have been included. To calculate the absolute bolometric luminosities, one has to account for reddening and distance moduli; the adopted values were taken from the literature as described in Chapter 3 and listed in Table 3.1. A galactic extinction law has been employed, as justiﬁed by Riess et al. (1996a). To calculate the total ﬂux in the UVOIR region of the spectrum, the observed magnitude in every single pass band is converted to its corresponding ﬂux at the effective wavelength. These ﬂuxes are multiplied by the bandwidth of the ﬁlter and summed up to get the total ﬂux. As there are gaps and overlaps between the ﬁlters, the ﬂux had to be corrected for. Missing pass bands have been corrected afterwards (see Section 5.1.1) and no interpolation for missing pass bands has been used for the calculation of the bolometric ﬂux. The bolometric light curves of a subset of the SNe Ia are shown in Figure 5.1. Only the time range with all available ﬁlter photometry is plotted. The peak luminosities are clearly different for the objects in the sample, and these differences are larger than the uncertainties in the derivation. The most striking feature, however, is the varying strength of the sec- ondary shoulder, which stems from the R and I light curves (see also Suntzeff (1996); for the detailed discussion of the shape of the bolometric light curves see Section 5.2). 38 5 Bolometric Light Curves -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 t (days after maximum) 41.0 41.5 42.0 42.5 43.0 43.5log L (erg/s) SN 1991T SN 1992bc SN 1995D SN 1989B SN 1994ae SN 1994D SN 1992A SN 1992bo SN 1991bg SN 1991T SN 1992bc SN 1995D SN 1989B SN 1994ae SN 1994D SN 1992A SN 1992bo SN 1991bg SN 1991T SN 1992bc SN 1995D SN 1989B SN 1994ae SN 1994D SN 1992A SN 1992bo SN 1991bg SN 1991T SN 1992bc SN 1995D SN 1989B SN 1994ae SN 1994D SN 1992A SN 1992bo SN 1991bg Figure 5.1: Bolometric light curves for some well observed SNe. Only the time range with the maximum number of ﬁlters for each supernova is displayed. The reddening and distance moduli have been taken from the literature as listed in Table 3.1 and corrections for missing U band are applied as described in Section 5.1.1. 5.1.1 Correction for Missing Pass Bands Flux outside UBVRI: In this analysis any ﬂux outside the optical wavelength range has been neglected. In particu- lar, contributions to the bolometric ﬂux from the ultraviolet (below 3200 ˚A) and the infrared above 1 µm(JHK) regimes should be considered in the calculations of the bolometric ﬂux. Using HST and IUE spectrophotometry for SN 1990N and SN 1992A, Suntzeff (1996) esti- mated the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted in the UV. He found that the bolometric light curve is dominated by the optical ﬂux; the ﬂux in the UV below the optical window drops well below 10% before maximum. The JHK evolution was assumed to be similar to that presented by Elias et al. (1985); these pass bands add at most 10% at early times and no more than about 15% 80 days after maximum, but around 25% at the time of the secondary maximum in the IR. For example, examination of the data of SNe 1980N and 1981D (infrared data from Elias et al. (1981) and optical from Hamuy et al. (1991)) shows that not more than 6% of the total ﬂux is emitted beyond I until 50 days past maximum, when the IR data stop. 5.1 Method and Uncertainties 39 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 t (days since B maximum) -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4∆L/L BV BVI BVRI 0 50 100 t (days since B maximum) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0F/FUBVRI BVRI BVI BV U B R V I VRI Figure 5.2: Left: Residuals for substituting individual pass band observations of SN 1989B by the corrections derived from SN 1994D. The errors never exceed 10% even when more than one ﬁlter is missing. Right: Correction factors for missing pass bands. The correction factors are obtained by comparing the ﬂux in the pass bands with the total UBVRI-ﬂux. In this work there is no correction applied for the ﬂux outside UBVRI unless stated explicitly (see Section 5.3 and Section 5.1.4). Corrections for pass bands missing in the optical range For missing pass bands between U and I one can infer corrections derived from those SNe Ia which have observations in all ﬁlters. Fig. 5.2 shows the correction factors obtained from SN 1994D. A cautionary note is appropriate here: SN 1994D displayed some unusual fea- tures, in particular a very blue color at maximum. To estimate the ﬂux corrections the ﬂux in each pass band was divided by the bolometric ﬂux. Since the ﬁlter transmission curves do not continuously cover the spectrum (i.e., there are gaps between U and B as well as be- tween B and V and overlaps between V and R, and R and I) the coaddition suffers from the interpolation between these pass bands. An interesting result from Figure 5.2 is the nearly constant bolometric correction for the V ﬁlter. This ﬁlter has been used in the past as a surrogate for bolometric light curves (e.g. Cappellaro et al. 1997). The validity of this assumption is conﬁrmed for phases between 30 and 110 days after B maximum where the overall variation is less than 3%. In order to test the procedure, bolometric light curves for SNe Ia (SNe 1989B, 1990N, 1991T), which have the full wavelength coverage, have been calculated after purposely omit- ting one or more pass bands and applying the correction factors derived from SN 1994D. As Figure 5.2 demonstrates for SN 1989B, the error is less than 10% at all times even if more than one ﬁlter is missing, although the errors vary considerably during the peak and the secondary shoulder phases. These results give conﬁdence that the bolometric light curves of 40 5 Bolometric Light Curves the SNe with missing U band can be corrected without incurring large errors. 5.1.2 Uncertainties Effects of systematic differences in photometry sets on the bolometric light curves Filter light curves from different observatories often show systematic differences of a few hundredths of a magnitude and up to more than 0.1 magnitude in the U band (Suntzeff et al. 1999). The blue cutoff of the U sensitivity function, for example, inﬂuences the transforma- tion from the natural to the standard system. This has big effects for supernovae, which have nonstellar spectra. The effect such systematic errors might have on the bolometric light curves has been examined by artiﬁcially shifting individual ﬁlter light curves by 0.1 magni- tudes and recomputing the bolometric light curves. In all cases the effect on the bolometric light curve is far less than the uncertainties in the distances and the extinction of the su- pernovae. Shifting the R or I light curve by 0.1 magnitude it was found that the bolometric luminosity changed by 2% at maximum and 5% 25 days later (approximately at second max- imum). For typical systematic uncertainties of 0.03 magnitudes in all ﬁlters, a maximal error of 2 to 3% is incurred. Also the bolometric light curve of SN 1994D was constructed for the individual data sets available (see references in Table 3.1). The difference never exceeds 4% out to 70 days after maximum even though the photometry in the individual ﬁlters differs up to 0.2 magnitudes in U, 0.1 mag in BRI and 0.05 mag in V. Uncertainties introduced by external parameters While uncertainties in the distance moduli will alter the absolute luminosities in each pass band (as well as the bolometric luminosity), the shape of the light curve is unaffected. As all distances used here are scaled to a Hubble constant of H0 = 65 km s−1 Mpc−1, the lumi- nosity differences are inﬂuenced only by errors in the determination of the relative distance modulus. Reddening, however, affects both the absolute luminosity and the light curve shape. The inﬂuence of extinction changes as a function of phase with the changing color of the su- pernova. A color excess of E(B–V) = 0.05 decreases the observed bolometric luminosity at t = tmax(bol) by 15%, while near the time of the second maximum in the R and I light curves (t = 20 days) the observed bolometric luminosity is reduced by 12%. A stronger extinction of E(B–V) = 0.35 reduces the observed bolometric luminosity by 67% (56%) at t = tmax (t = 20 days). The uncertainty in the reddening estimate introduces subtle additional effects. If δE(B–V) = 0.02 mag at low reddenings (E(B–V) < 0.05), an additional uncertainty of 5% in the bolo- metric luminosity is introduced. At higher reddening values (E(B–V) = 0.3), uncertainties of δE(B–V) = 0.05 and 0.10 produce changes of 15% and 31% in the bolometric luminosity, respectively. The decline rate of the bolometric light curve decreases with increasing reddening due to the color evolution of the supernova and the selective absorption. For SN 1994D ∆m 15(bol) would evolve linearly from 1.13 at hypothetical E(B–V) = 0 to 0.99 at E(B–V) = 0.35. The linearity breaks down at about E(B–V) ≈ 0.5. As described by Leibundgut (1988) the reddening depends on the intrinsic color of the observed object (Schmid-Kaler 1982). This implies that the color evolution inﬂuences the shape of the ﬁlter light curves (and not only the different proportions of the ﬂux in the ﬁlters 5.1 Method and Uncertainties 41 and consequently the shape of the bolometric light curve). A typical color evolution of B–V= 0.7 for SNe Ia in the ﬁrst 15 days results in an increase of ∆m15(B) by 0.2 × E(B–V) simply due to the color dependence of the reddening. The increase of ∆m 15 for blue ﬁlters is larger than for the redder pass bands. This diminishes the effect of the color dependence on ∆m 15(bol), which comes from the color evolution of the supernova and the selective absorption. Uncertainties introduced by the method The effect of ﬁtting the light curves before constructing the bolometric light curves can be seen in Figure 5.3. The bolometric ﬂux for SN 1992bc determined in this way is compared against the straight integration over the wavelengths of the ﬁlter observations. The symbols indicate the bolometric luminosity as calculated directly from the observations, asterisks for those epochs, when observations in 4 bands (BVRI) are available, squares for 3 bands (BVR or BVI), triangles for 2 bands (BR or VR) and diamonds for observations in one band only (B or R). The correction for missing bands is applied as described in Section 5.1.1. The dotted line is the bolometric luminosity calculated from the ﬁts to the individual pass bands. The agreement between the two approaches is excellent and no differences can be observed. This also applies to the correction for the missing pass bands. Even when more than 2 pass bands are not observed, the corrected ﬂux matches with the ﬂux calculated from the ﬁts. Deviations can be found only for those parameters derived from the light curve, which extrapolate far from the observed epochs, e.g. the rise time. The integration over wavelengths to calculate the bolometric light curve can be per- formed in different ways. A straight integration of the broad-band ﬂuxes has to take into account the transmission of, and any overlaps and gaps between, ﬁlters. Several integration techniques have been tried, but it was found that for all interpolation methods, the bolomet- ric ﬂux has been reproduced to within 2% at any considered epoch. This has already been shown for SN 1987A by Suntzeff & Bouchet (1990). The chosen method in this work is to cal- culate the bolometric ﬂux by summing the ﬂux at the effective ﬁlter wavelength multiplied with the ﬁlter bandwidth. 5.1.3 Comparison with Spectra To justify the applied procedure of constructing the bolometric light curves, the method has been tested by comparing the bolometric light curve with the ﬂux calculated by the straight integration over the spectrum. From the spectra of SNe 1990N (Leibundgut et al. 1991; Jeffery et al. 1992) and 1992A (Kir- shner et al. 1993) the ﬂuxes and magnitudes in the ﬁlter bands have been calculated. These magnitudes were then used to construct bolometric light curves with the method described above (see Section 5.1). Comparing the ﬂuxes with those gained from direct integration over wavelength of the spectrum shows an accuracy of better than 10% for the spectra with good wavelength coverage from U to I. This gives us further conﬁdence to use the method described above. The internal accuracy of the UBVRI ﬂux can be very high, since the broad- band photometry is known to a few percent everywhere. However, the external accuracy is much lower than this due to the non-rectangular bandpasses of the ﬁlters and the non-stellar nature of the spectrum (Bouchet et al. 1991). 42 5 Bolometric Light Curves -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 t (days after maximum) 41.5 42.0 42.5 43.0 43.5log L (erg/s) SN 1992bcSN 1992bc Figure 5.3: Constructing the bolometric light curves before and after ﬁtting the ﬁlter light curves of SN 1992bc.

The correction for missing bands is applied as described in Section 5.1.1. The dotted line is the bolometric luminosity calculated from the ﬁts to the individual pass bands. 5.1.4 SN 1998bu and the Contribution of JHK to the Bolometric Light Curve As for most SNe only UBVRI ﬁlter observations are available for the construction of the bolometric light curves, it is interesting to estimate the amount of ﬂux which is missed in the infrared. Some SNe (1998bu, 1980N, 1981D) have excellent optical observations as well as infrared light curves (infrared data for SNe 1980N and 1981D from Elias et al. (1981, 1985) and optical from Hamuy et al. (1991), for SN 1998bu see Table 3.1). SN 1998bu has been chosen to be shown here, because its IR light curve starts as early as 8.4 days before B maximum and has a fairly good coverage within the ﬁrst season of observations in the IR as well as at optical wavelengths (see Figure 5.4). The observations of Hernandez et al. (2000), Jha et al. (1999), Suntzeff et al. (1999), and Munari et al. (1998) have been combined. For the distance modulus and reddening the values given in Table 3.1 have been adopted. In Figure 5.5 the UBVRIJHK light curve of SN 1998bu is plotted. 5.1 Method and Uncertainties 43 0 20 40 60 t – tmax(B) (days) 16 14 12 10 8m U + 1.0 B V R – 0.4 I – 0.9 J – 2.4 H – 3.1 K – 3.8 Figure 5.4: UBVRIJHK light curves of SN 1998bu. The light curves have been shifted by the amount labelled. The solid lines show the ﬁt of Equation 4.1 to the well sam- pled UBVRI light curves. The ﬁts to JHK suffer from the non availability of late time observations (dotted lines). For the calculation of the bolometric light curve the light curves of the optical ﬁlters have been ﬁtted with the method described in Chapter 4 to get a continuous representation of the observations also at the epochs of IR observations. The combination of optical and IR observations leads to the UBVRIJHK light curve of SN 1998bu (crosses) and if those lumi- nosities are ﬁt, one gets the solid line for the UBVRIJHK light curve. As the IR observations are sparsely sampled and stop after about 33 days past maximum, consequently the ﬁt suf- fers from the non availability of the late decline. Also the secondary bump is not sampled till its end. Therefore the derived parameters of the UBVRIJHK light curve have to be han- dled with care. Only the observations with full wavelength coverage have been taken into account. For comparison the UBVRI light curve is shown as dotted line in Figure 5.5. The enhancement of the secondary bump and the shift of the time of maximum to about 0.5 days earlier caused by the inclusion of the IR data can be seen, too. The JHK light curves peak about 5 days earlier than in the B band (Hernandez et al. 2000). Although the contribution of the ﬂux in the IR is not large around maximum light, it is enough to shift the time of maximum to earlier epochs. 44 5 Bolometric Light Curves -10 0 10 20 30 40 t (days after UBVRI maximum) 42.4 42.6 42.8 43.0 43.2log L (erg/s) Figure 5.5: The UBVRIJHK light curve of SN 1998bu (crosses) and ﬁt (solid line) com- pared with the UBVRI light curve (dotted). The enhancement of the secondary bump and the shift of the maximum to earlier times can be seen. The contributions of the ﬁlter light curve to the total UBVRIJHK-ﬂux can be seen in Fig- ure 5.6 (left panel), where the increase of the redder ﬁlters can be seen. In the right plot of Figure 5.6 the fraction of the UBVRIJHK-ﬂux which can be observed in UBVRI is dis- played. The triangles show the epochs of the IR observations and the dotted line is the ﬁt to the UBVRI luminosity divided by the UBVRIJHK luminosity. The fraction of light in the infrared, which is missed because of limiting the integration to UBVRI, increases from about 10% around maximum to 25% 30 days after UBVRI maximum, where the contribution of the longer wavelengths is biggest (see also Figure 5.2). This is in perfect concordance with the results of Section 5.1.1 where the JHK ﬂux contribution of SNe 1980N and 1981D was estimated. With later data of SN 1998bu, which have been already observed but not yet published, the ﬂux in the IR of SNe Ia can be determined. Only the high extinction which SN 1998bu suffers from is a major uncertainty in the determination of the ﬂux distribution as well as of the bolometric light curve as described in Section 5.1.2. One could estimate the ﬂux in the IR from ﬁtting a blackbody spectrum to the observed magnitudes in the optical wavelength range. The magnitude can be converted to the ﬂux at the effective wavelength and then a blackbody spectrum is ﬁtted.

For SN 1998bu there are JHK observations and the ﬂux can be compared directly to the blackbody ﬂux. Minimizing χ2 in for optical wavelengths, the temperature of the blackbody is calculated. For high temperatures as before maximum, this approach leads to a reasonable estimation of the IR ﬂux (about 15%), whereas at later times (around 30 days past maximum) the ﬁt gets worse and the IR ﬂux is estimated to be around 40% which is by far in excess of the 25% derived from the JHK magnitudes in the previous paragraph. 5.2 Shape of the Bolometric Light Curves 5.2.1 Peak Light Curve Shape Inspection of Fig. 5.1 clearly shows the brighter SNe having wider primary peaks than the fainter SNe. In order to quantify this statement the width of the bolometric light curve has been mea- sured at half the peak luminosity (with t−1/2 denoting the time it takes to rise and t +1/2 to decline, see Tables 5.1 and A.2). For a descriptive illustration see Figure 2.3. There are sufﬁcient pre-maximum observations available for nine supernovae from which the full width of the peak can be reliably determined (SNe 1990N, 1991T, 1992A, 1992bc, 1992bo, 1994D, 1994ae, 1995bd, 1998de). In ﬁve cases the ﬁrst observations were obtained be- low the half-maximum ﬂux level; in the case of SN 1991T the bolometric light curve was ex- trapolated by about 1.5 days, for SN 1992A and SN 1992bc by about 2 days and for SN 1995bd by about 0.5 days. The bright SNe 1990N, 1991T, 1992bc and 1995bd show a peak width 46 5 Bolometric Light Curves Table 5.1: Parameters describing the light curve shape of the bolometric light curve: Width of the light curve at half the peak luminosity (t−1/2 and t+1/2), epoch of the max- ima and the minimum of the ﬁrst derivative (t1stdev max , t1stdev min and t1stdev 2ndmax, see Section 5.2.2) and the secondary maximum in I (tI 2ndmax) relative to bolometric maximum light.

The pre-maximum rise t−1/2 in the bolometric light curve is, in all cases, substantially faster than the decline t+1/2 by between 20 to 30% or a time difference of between 1.5 to almost 5 days (Table 5.1). The decline to half the supernova’s peak luminosity t+1/2 is available for 21 SNe (1989B, 1990N, 1991T, 1991bg, 1992A, 1992bc, 1992bo, 1993H, 1993O, 1993ag, 1994D, 1994ae, 1995D, 1995E, 1995ac, 1995al, 1995bd, 1996X, 1996bo, 1998bu, 1998de, see Table 5.1) and varies from 9 days to 14 days. A weak correlation between maximum brightness and half light width can be seen (Figure 5.7). For this analysis only SNe with sufﬁcient coverage (rise: ﬁrst ob- servation not later than 3 days after tmax − t−1/2, decline: ﬁrst observation before tmax(bol)) have been included. The half light time for the rise helps to characterize the rise to maximum light without extrapolating the light curve to epochs earlier than ever observed. As the rise to maximum is sensitive to the initial composition of the exploding white dwarf (H ¨oﬂich et al. 1998) quantifying the rise part of the light curve is of importance for investigating 5.2 Shape of the Bolometric Light Curves 47 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 42.4 42.6 42.8 43.0 43.2 43.4 42.4 42.6 42.8 43.0 43.2 43.4log Lmax (erg/s) t -1/2 (days) rise 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 42.4 42.6 42.8 43.0 43.2 43.4log Lmax (erg/s) t +1/2 (days) decline Figure 5.7: Rise to and decline from maximum in bolometric light curves.

It is not possible in all cases to quan- tify this secondary bump with the parameters of the ﬁtting function described in Chapter 4, because the ﬁt parameters are not independent and even the pre-maximum exponential rise still can affect the light curve shape 20 to 40 days after maximum, especially in the R and I light curves as already mentioned in Section 4.1. This may result in damped or enhanced second Gaussians of Equation 4.1. For that reason the ﬁrst derivative of the ﬁt is calculated: dm dt = γ − g0 (t − t0) exp [− (t−t0)2 2σ2 0 ] σ−2 0 − g1 (t − t1) exp [− (t−t1)2 2σ2 1 ] σ−2 1 [1 − exp ( τ−t θ )] − { f0 + γ (t − σ0) + g0 exp [− (t−t0)2 2σ2 0 ] + g1 exp [− (t−t1)2 2σ2 1 ]} exp ( τ−t θ ) [1 − exp ( τ−t θ )]2 θ . (5.1) Again the advantage of the model is that it is a continuous representation and a differen- tiable function. Almost all SNe with sufﬁcient observational data show two maxima and one minimum in the ﬁrst derivative (listed in Table 5.1). 48 5 Bolometric Light Curves -20 0 20 40 60 80 t (days after maximum) 41.5 42.0 42.5 43.0 43.5log Lbol (erg/s) 0 20 40 60 80 100 t (days after maximum) -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15first derivative (mag/days) Figure 5.8: First derivative of the bolometric light curve function of SN 1992bc (Right) with the position of the minimum and maxima and the zero-crossing of the ﬁrst deriva- tive also shown in the bolometric light curve (Left). The vertical lines denote the epochs of the maxima and minima of the ﬁrst derivative as well as of the light curve itself. The ﬁrst derivative of the bolometric light curve and the position of these maxima and of the minimum and the zero-crossing is shown in Figure 5.8 (Right) for SN 1992bc. The left panel shows the bolometric light curve for clariﬁcation, where the epochs of the minima and maxima of the ﬁrst derivative are indicated as solid vertical lines just as the maximum is as a dotted line. After maximum light the slope of the light curve increases, reaches its maximum at 12.6 days (point of inﬂection1) and gets ﬂatter again, obtains its minimum value 29.3 days after maximum, getting steeper again with a second maximum slope at 41.4 days before ﬁnally settling down to a constant slope of about 0.025 mag day−1 from 60 days on. In Figure 5.9 the maxima and the minimum of the ﬁrst derivative of the ﬁt function are plotted versus the position of the secondary maximum in the I light curve (Left) and versus t1/2 (Right). It shows that the second maximum in the I band is shortly after the minimum of the ﬁrst derivative of the bolometric light curve (dotted line in Figure 5.9 (Left)). Also the maximum slope is reached within a few days after t+1/2 (see Figure 5.9 (Right)). Not in all cases the slope differs a lot in its extreme values, sometimes the minimum of the ﬁrst derivative is very shallow with the slope at the second maximum being not much steeper. Therefore, the depth of the minimum is an indicator of the strength of the bump of the light curve. For example, the outlier in the left plot at t I 2ndmax = 23 is SN 1991T which has a very weak secondary maximum in I. This also means, that the minimum of the ﬁrst derivative is very shallow and thus uncertain. SN 1991T being an outlier has been tested by 1Hamuy et al. (1996d) have calculated the inﬂection point for their template light curves in B. They found that it correlates with ∆m15(B) as well as the bend of the light curve does with the time of the secondary maximum in I. 5.3 Derived Quantities from the Bolometric Light Curves 49 15 20 25 30 t2ndmax(I)(days after bolometric maximum) 10 20 30 40t (days after maximum) max2 min max1 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 t+1/2 (days) 10 20 30 40t (days after maximum) max2 min max1 Figure 5.9: Left: Epochs of the maxima and the minimum of the ﬁrst derivative of the bolometric light curve versus the position of the secondary maximum in the I light curve.

Using this value to test, SN 1991T is more than 3 σ away from the mean what clearly identi- ﬁes it as an outlier. As there is a correlation between t1/2 and Lmax (see Figure 5.7) it is not surprising that Lmax and the epochs of the extrema of the ﬁrst derivative are correlated, too. This is shown in Figure 5.10. The luminosity width relation also holds for the light curve shape at later times. 5.3 Derived Quantities from the Bolometric Light Curves 5.3.1 Radioactive Decay and γ–ray Escape As already mentioned in Chapter 2, the deposited and in the optical wavelength range rera- diated energy stems from the radioactive decay of 56Ni synthesized in the explosion. 50 5 Bolometric Light Curves 42.8 42.9 43.0 43.1 43.2 43.3 43.4 log Lmax (erg/s) 10 20 30 40t (days after maximum) max2 min max1 Figure 5.10: Epoch of the extrema of the ﬁrst derivative of the bolometric light curve versus Lmax. The asterisks and trian- gles indicate the epochs of the maxima of the ﬁrst derivative and the ﬁlled triangles the position of the minimum. There is also observational evidence for the decay from 56Ni to 56Co to 56Fe in SNe Ia (Kuchner et al. 1994), as the observed iron to cobalt ﬂux ratio derived from spectral features evolves as expected when the 56Fe/56Co abundance ratio follows the 56Ni to 56Co to 56Fe decay. A compilation of the radioactive properties of 56Ni and 56Co can be found in Nadyozhin (1994). 56Ni decays to 56Co via electron capture with a half-life time of T1/2 = 6.10 days (λNi = ln 2/T1/2 = 1/8.8 days−1) and a total energy emitted via gamma photons of QNi γ = 1.75 MeV whereas QNi ν = 0.41 MeV is carried away by neutrinos. 56Co transforms to the stable isotope 56Fe with a half-life time of T1/2 = 77.12 days (λCo = 1/111.3 days−1) in 81% via electron capture and in 19% via positron decay. The total energy emitted via gamma photons is QCo γ = 3.61 MeV, the total kinetic energy of the positrons is Q Co e+ = 0.12 MeV and QCo ν = 0.84 MeV are carried away by neutrinos. As long as the energy input from 56Ni decay plays a role, the optical depth for γ–rays is still very large, the 56Ni γ–rays can not escape but thermalize. Also, for the epochs analyzed in this work, the positrons are completely trapped. At later times they can escape, depending on the geometry of magnetic ﬁelds (Ruiz-Lapuente & Spruit 1998; Milne et al. 1999). A fraction of exp (−τ) γ–rays from the 56Co decay can escape (Jeffery 2001), where τ is the mean of the effective γ–ray absorption opacity optical depth of the beam path, which is assumed to be location- and direction-independent in the optical thin limit with only one radioactive species. This is summarized in the equation for the energy deposition of N Ni 0 56Ni atoms: Edep = ENi + ECo e+ + [1 − exp (−τ)] ECo γ = λNiNNi 0 exp (−λNit) QNi γ (5.2) + λCoNNi 0 λNi λNi − λCo [exp (−λCot) − exp (−λNit)] {QCo e+ + QCo γ [1 − exp (−τ)]} .

The curve for complete trapping (dashed-dotted) approaches the energy input from the 56Ni and the 56Co decay respectively asymptotically (thin solid lines). In the case of free escape (dashed line) the line follows the 56Ni decay longer because the only energy input from the 56Co decay is from annihilating electron- positron pairs and the positron channel is taken only in 19% of the decays and, in addition, is less energetic. 5.3.2 Nickel Mass Nickel mass derived from the bolometric luminosity at maximum light Given the peak luminosity it is straight forward to derive the amount of 56Ni, the so-called “nickel mass”, which powers the supernova emission. Arnett (1982) has shown, that the lu- minosity at peak was equal to the instantaneous energy deposition rate under the assump- tion of constant opacity both in space and time, a constant-density structure, and the require- ment that the radial distribution of the energy deposition was identical to that of the thermal energy. Thus the luminosity at the maximum is directly related to the total amount of 56Ni synthesized in the explosion (“Arnett’s law”: see Arnett 1982; Arnett et al. 1985; Pinto & Eastman 2000). Pinto & Eastman (2000) have included more eigenmodes for the description of the shape of the energy density. The higher order modes describe variations of the energy density on smaller spatial scales. As these energy variations do not have far to go to diffuse out to smoother distributions, the power in these modes declines rapidly. If the energy depositon is uniform over the entire star, the higher order modes have to be taken into account, as 52 5 Bolometric Light Curves 14.0 16.0 18.0 20.0 22.0 24.0 trise (days) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5MNi log Lmax = 42.3 log Lmax = 43.0 log L max = 43.3 Figure 5.12: Variation of the amount of 56Ni dependent on the rise time trise shown for three bolometric luminosities. The de- pendence has been calculated assuming Arnett’s law and the 56Ni to 56Co to 56Fe decay as described in the text. the energy deposited near the surface suffers less from adiabatic decompression. The light curve peaks earlier and at a higher luminosity. But if 56Ni does not extend beyond 85% of the radius, the distribution of the radioactivity has little effect on the light curve. For the calculation of the 56Ni mass the simple equation Lmax = 2.2 ± 0.2 × 10 43 MNi erg s−1 M⊙−1 (5.3) of Arnett et al. (1985) has been used. Since not all the emerging energy from the SNe Ia is sampled by UBVRI, but is restricted to the optical ﬂuxes, the total luminosity is underestimated. As in Section 5.1.1 and 5.1.4 described, about 10% of the bolometric ﬂux is not accounted by the optical ﬁlters near maxi- mum light. We use this estimate as a lower limit of the bolometric ﬂux. All masses thus had to be increased by a factor 1.1. The nickel masses are listed in Table 5.2. Another uncertainty is the exact rise time, which is an important parameter in the calcu- lation. Equation 5.3 corresponds to the energy deposition of Equation 5.2 with a rise time of about 17 days to the bolometric maximum and complete trapping of γ–rays. It is likely that there are signiﬁcant differences in the rise times and this would alter the estimates for the Ni mass. A longer rise time would imply a larger nickel mass for a given measured luminos- ity. This is shown in Figure 5.12. Decreasing the rise time to 12 days yields only 70% MNi of the values given in Table 5.2. Such a short rise time is excluded for most of the SNe Ia, where observations as early as 14 days have been recorded (SN 1990N: Leibundgut et al. (1991), Lira et al. (1998), SN 1994D: Vacca & Leibundgut (1996)), but could still be feasible for SN 1991bg. For a more realistic range of 16 to 20 days between explosion and bolometric maximum the nickel mass would change by only ∓10% from the values provided here. If the relation between the bolometric luminosity and t−1/2 (Figure 5.7) is taken as a measurement of the dependence of the rise time on the bolometric luminosity, this trend would make the brighter SNe even more 56Ni rich relative to less luminous SNe. 5.3 Derived Quantities from the Bolometric Light Curves 53 Table 5.2: Gamma escape ﬁt parameters, MNi and t0.

With the currently best available distances the SNe span a range of 2.5 in the 56Ni mass (excluding SNe 1991bg and 1998de, which have about 1/10 of the 56Ni mass of the brightest objects). Comparison with other determinations of the 56Ni masses For a few of the supernovae, nickel masses have been measured by other methods. As both the applied distance moduli (µ) and the values of the total absorption (A bol) used from different authors vary the following equation has to be used to compare nickel masses: MNi = M∗ Ni 100.4(µ−µ∗+Abol−A∗ bol). (5.4) For the total bolometric absorption Abol = −2.5 log Lred L (Lred and L being the reddened and dereddened bolometric luminosity) at the bolometric maximum the following dependence on E(B–V) has been derived from the ﬂux distribution of SN 1991T at maximum (valid for 54 5 Bolometric Light Curves E(B–V) between 0 and 2): Abol =[3.55 − 0.57 E(B–V)] E(B–V). (5.5) SN 1991T has an upper limit for the radioactive nickel produced in the explosion of about 1 M⊙ based on the 1.644 µm Fe lines (Spyromilio et al. 1992). This value depends on the exact ionization structure of the supernova one year after explosion and a conservative range of 0.4 to 1 M⊙ had been derived. This is consistent with the estimate from the bolometric luminosity at maximum. Bowers et al. (1997) have derived nickel masses for several SNe Ia in a similar way. Their best estimates for SN 1991T, SN 1994ae, and SN 1995D are all about half the value found here, when converted to their distances and extinctions (with Equation 5.4). However, they point out that their values should be increased by a factor of 1.2 to 1.7 to account for ionization states not included in their analysis. With this correction a fair agreement is found. Cappellaro et al. (1997) derived masses from the late V light curves using a simple Monte Carlo code for the γ–ray and positron deposition to calculate the bolometric light curve. For the escape of the optical photons a grey opacity is assumed. M Ni determines the absolute luminosity, and the total mass of the ejecta Mej determines the optical depth for the radiation from the radioactive decay. Fitting both the light curve around maximum and the late de- cline results in a single set of these two parameters. There are four objects in common with our study: SN 1991bg, SN 1991T, SN 1992A, and SN 1994D. Adjusting the determinations to the same distances and re-normalizing to the SN 1991T 56Ni mass found in this work, there is a general agreement, although there are differences at the 0.1 M⊙ level. Nickel masses were also derived from the line proﬁles of [ Fe II ] and[Fe III ] lines in the optical by Mazzali et al. (1998). These measurements depend critically on the ionization structure in the ejecta and had been normalized to a nickel mass of SN 1991T of 1 M⊙. They assume that the line width deﬁnes the volume of the 56Ni sphere and that this translates directly into a 56Ni mass. Thus the 56Ni masses scale with v3. They ﬁnd that SN 1986G has 0.3 times the mass of SN 1991T, SNe 1981B and 1992A have 0.4 − 0.5, and SNe 1990N and 1994D have 0.5 − 0.6, the very subluminous SN 1991bg has only 0.01 times the mass of SN 1991T. As this SN has a lower degree of ionization the investigated lines are not blended (the fractional abundance of the Fe III is smaller). When their masses are scaled to our measurements a reasonable agreement is found. 5.3.3 γ–ray Escape and the Total Mass of SNe Ia The nickel mass is determined from the bolometric luminosity at maximum light (see Sec- tion 5.3.2), while the energy deposition can be calculated from the late decline of the bolo- metric light curve. A ﬁt of Equation 5.2 to the observed bolometric luminosity (dotted line) at epochs later than 50 days past maximum (vertical dotted line), when thermalized pho- tons can escape freely, is shown in Figure 5.13 (solid line). Like in Figure 5.11, the dashed- dotted line indicates the energy deposition with complete trapping (τ = ∞)of γ–rays and positrons, and the dashed line shows the energy deposition for γ–rays from the 56Co decay escaping freely (while the γ–rays from the 56Ni decay and the positrons from the 56Co decay are completely trapped). The bolometric light curves have been corrected for missing pass bands, but they only have been used, if at least BVI are observed till day 70. The ﬁt has been restricted to the 5.3 Derived Quantities from the Bolometric Light Curves 55 40.5 41.0 41.5 42.0 42.5 43.0 43.5log L (ergs/s) MNi = 1.14 t0 = 38.10 91T MNi = 0.84 t0 = 35.12 92bc -20 0 20 40 60 80 t (days after maximum) 40.5 41.0 41.5 42.0 42.5 43.0 43.5log L (ergs/s) MNi = 0.41 t0 = 27.90 94D 0 20 40 60 80 100 t (days after maximum) MNi = 0.10 t0 = 23.78 91bg Figure 5.13: Fit of Equation 5.2 to the observed bolometric luminosity (solid line).

Note that at these epochs basically all 56Ni has decayed to 56Co and contributes a negli- gable amount to the deposited energy. If there is only a single radioactive species, the mean optical depth ¯τ has a simple t−2 time dependence: ¯τ = t2 0 t2 . (5.6) Following the discussion in Jeffery (2001) one gets for the ﬁducial time t0, i.e. roughly the time of transition between the optically thick and thin epochs: t0 = √ M κ q 8π 1 ve . (5.7) q is a general form factor and describes the initial 56Ni concentration. It is large for high concentration to the center (with a maximum value of 1), small for low concentration and 56 5 Bolometric Light Curves 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 MNi 20 25 30 35 40 45t0 (days) Figure 5.14: Fiducial time t0 versus amount of 56Ni. 1/3 for evenly spread 56Ni. M is the total mass and κ a constant opacity. t0 is independent of the distance, because it only depends on the shape of the light curve. The range of t0 together with the velocities obtained from Mazzali et al. (1998) show, that the physical parameters q, κ or/and M have to vary for the different SNe. If one assumes that the distribution of 56Ni and κ is constant, the total mass has to differ by a factor of 2.4 (ex- cluding SN 1991bg). To accomplish for a factor of 2.4 only with changing the concentration factor q, this parameter would have to change more than its expected range. 56Ni is synthe- sized most where the density of the white dwarf is highest, making it most concentrated in the center. t0 itself spans a range of a factor of 1.55 (see Table 5.2). In Figure 5.14 the ﬁducial time t0 is plotted versus the 56Ni mass. A strong correlation can be seen. Chapter 6 Conclusions In this work, a new method (Vacca & Leibundgut 1996; Contardo et al. 2000) to analyze Type Ia supernova light curve data was extended and for the ﬁrst time thoroughly applied. It is a useful tool for uniform determination of light curve parameters. I estimated the error budget and applied our method to two speciﬁc questions to show the advantages and differences compared to other methods. Our method gives a continuous representation of the often too sparse observational data. This continuous representation can be used to derive important light curve parameters. Assumptions as in template ﬁt methods are avoided, allowing the parameters to be derived more individually. An afﬂuent collection of light curves and parameters is given in Appendix A. This catalogue will be a valuable base for further analysis. By analyzing the epochs of maximum light in different wavelength regimes it has been demonstrated, that Type Ia supernovae do not act like an expanding cooling sphere. The determination of the rise time – the time it takes the supernova to reach maximum light – has shown differences and problems of our approach compared to other studies. The major disadvantage is that the ﬁt of the rising part of the light curve might be inﬂuenced by the availability or absence of observations after maximum light. The ﬁts of the light curves in UBVRI have been used to construct optical bolometric light curves; the continuous representation of the light curve again being an advantage. The inte- grated ﬂux in UBVRI provides a reliable measure of the bolometric luminosity and therefore represents a meaningful physical quantity. This quantity depends directly on the amount of nickel produced in the explosion, on the energy deposition, and on the γ–ray escape. The error budget has been investigated and the bolometric light curves constructed from the broadband ﬁlters have been compared with direct calculations from observed spectra. Using the early IR observations of SN 1998bu, the ﬂux in the infrared can be estimated. The contin- uous form of the UBVRI light curves allows to calculate the bolometric ﬂux UBVRIJHK at the epochs of the IR observations. I analyzed the shape of the peak light curve and found a weak correlation between the maximum brightness and half light time for both rise and decline. The half light time for the rise may be used to characterize the rise to maximum light without the need to extrapolate the light curve to epochs earlier than observed. Compared to the rise time, I thus get a more reliable parameter for the region of the light curve, which is sensitive to the initial composition of the exploding white dwarf. The secondary bump which is seen in most red and infrared light curves is still visible in the bolometric light curves and can be quantiﬁed by the maxima and minima of the ﬁrst derivative. I found a correlation between 58 6 Conclusions the maximum luminosity and the epochs of the extrema of the ﬁrst derivative. This shows that the luminosity width relation also holds for the light curve shape at later times. The bolometric light curves can be used to derive further quantities. As the energy radi- ated in the optical wavelength range stems from the radioactive decay of 56Ni synthesized in the explosion, the amount of 56Ni can be calculated. Following Arnett’s law – the lu- minosity at peak being equal to the instantaneous energy deposition rate – the amount of 56Ni has been derived. These 56Ni masses are consistent with other determinations. The γ–ray escape fraction can be determined by ﬁtting theoretical curves to the bolometric light curves. Combining these results with other parameters derived from observations, it can be shown that the total mass, the distribution of 56Ni and the opacity of the ejecta have to have different values throughout the sample of SNe analyzed in this work. Appendix A Catalogue A.1 Introduction Using published observations of Type Ia SNe (see Table 3.1), a catalogue of ﬁt parameters (Table A.1) and light curve parameters (A.2) has been compiled. Figures A.1 to A.60 show the observations and ﬁts. In Table A.1 the ﬁt parameters of all analyzed SN light curves are shown. The 10 ﬁt parameters of Equation 4.1 described in Section 4.1, the time range of the ﬁt and the re- duced χ2 are given. It has to be noted, that χ2 depends on the adopted errors of the data points, which are taken from the published values. As a consequence, if χ2 of SNe ob- served by different groups are compared, the smaller χ2 not necessarily means the better ﬁt. When for a single SN data sets of more than one group are considered, this may result in over/underestimating the weight of some observations in the ﬁt. In a few cases (SN 1991bg, SN 1994D, SN 1997br) the errors had to be set to an reasonable value (0.1, 0.1, 0.03 mag), because of the non-availability of errors in at least one data set so as to result in a χ2 of the order of 1. If the resulting χ2 is much smaller than 1 the ﬁt converges too fast and maybe not to the minimum χ2. But as all data points are set to the same error, the late data (less luminous and therefore more noisy) get too much weight if the errors have to be ﬁxed to a single value. For some SNe parts of the light curve are not well sampled with observations. Therefore, some ﬁt parameters had to be ﬁxed (printed in italics). The dashes signify the ﬁts without exponential rise or second Gaussian respectively. The second Gaussian has not been ﬁtted for the U and B light curves or if there were not enough observations. The bolometric light curves have all been ﬁtted with two Gaussians and with errors chosen to be 0.01 regarding the fact that they were ﬁtted to the bolometric light curves constructed from the ﬁts in the ﬁlter light curves. Exceptions to this procedure are listed in Section A.2. Table A.2 presents the light curve parameters which were derived from the ﬁts shown in Table A.1 and Figures A.1 to A.60. The rise time trise is calculated from the ﬁt as the time the SN takes to rise from 30 mag below maximum to maximum light, tmax, mmax, tmin, mmin, t2ndmax, and m2ndmax are the epoch (in JD +2440000) and magnitude (in mag) at the ﬁrst maximum, the minimum and the second maximum, as calculated from the ﬁt respectively. The now classical decline parameter ∆m15 is the difference in magnitude from maximum to 15 days later. The width of the light curve at half the peak luminosity is measured, t−1/2 denoting the time (in days) it takes to rise and t +1/2 to decline. Furthermore, the slope of the 60 A Catalogue late decline (in mag/day) between 50 and 80 days after maximum is shown. This slope is not necessarily the same as the ﬁt parameter γ as especially in I the secondary Gaussian and even the exponential rise have still not negligible inﬂuence on the late light curve. Usually the late slope as calculated from the ﬁtted light curve is bigger than γ. All these parameters are only shown, if the time range important for the parameter is covered by observations, e.g. if the SN is not observed at maximum, the peak magnitude and the epoch of maximum is not shown and ∆m15 either. For SNe 1989B, 1990N, 1990af, 1991T, 1991bg, 1992A, 1992al, 1992bc, 1992bg, 1992bo, 1992bp, 1993B, 1993H, 1993O, 1993ag, 1994D, 1994M, 1994S, 1994ae, 1995D, 1995E, 1995ac, 1995ak, 1995al, 1995bd, 1996C, 1996X, 1996bo, 1997br, 1998bu, 1998de the uncertainties are shown in the second row as given by the Monte Carlo simulations described in Section 4.2. For both tables (Table A.1 and A.2), the bolometric luminosities have been converted to an arbitrary magnitude system to allow for the same treatment as the ﬁlter light curves (using a constant of 120): mbol = const. − 2.5 log Lbol. (A.1) As the zero points of the bolometric magnitude scale in the literature differ, the bolometric magnitude is replaced by Equation A.1 for simplicity. For the light curve shape the nor- malization does not matter and using the absolute ﬂuxes is preferred for the comparison to models. In Figures A.1 to A.60 the individual UBVRI and bolometric light curves as well as the residuals of the data are shown. The dotted line represents the ﬁt, the solid line indicates the time range over which the ﬁt was restricted. The symbols are the data points. The left axis shows the observed apparent magnitudes and the right axis the magnitude below maximum light or (if no maximum magnitude could be calculated) relative to the observation with maximum ﬂux. The time axis is relative to the B maximum. For those ﬁlters where no ﬁt could be achieved only the observations are shown. In the panels of the bolometric light curves the solid line shows the bolometric light curve constructed from the ﬁts to the ﬁlter observations and corrected for missing ﬁlters within UBVRI as described in Section 5.1. The dotted line is the extension also to epochs, when not the maximum number of ﬁlters (as written in column 2 of Table 3.1) is available. The bolometric ﬂux as calculated from the observations is shown as asterisks only for epochs with simultaneous observations in all ﬁlters (compare to Figure 5.3). In most cases the computation of the bolometric luminosity gives the same result no matter whether it was calculated from the ﬁts to the ﬁlter light curves or directly from the observations. But the two values can differ signiﬁcantly, if it was not possible to ﬁt one or more of the ﬁlter light curves (e.g. SN 1991U, Figure A.9): The bolometric luminosities from the observations have been calculated from all available observations (BVRI), but the ﬁtted light curve is from fewer bands (B band only for SN 1991U). The bolometric luminosity from the ﬁt (solid line) is the B band light curve corrected for missing pass bands as described in Section 5.1. As it has to be corrected for more bands than were available, the slope of the bolometric luminosity differs and is not reliable. A.2 Annotations to Individual SNe 61 A.2 Annotations to Individual SNe In the following the ﬁts to the observations of the individual SNe are discussed. All bolo- metric light curves have been ﬁtted with all 10 ﬁt parameters, even if the ﬁlter light curves have not. The time range of the observations has been restricted to 150 days after maximum unless stated otherwise. The U and B light curves have been ﬁtted with only one Gaussian. If some parameters have been ﬁxed or the rise or the second Gaussian have not been ﬁtted, it is mentioned in the discussion and can be seen in Table A.1 (dashes for not ﬁtted parts of the light curve and italics for ﬁxed values). SN 1989B UBV light curves have been calculated with no rise because of lack of pre-maximum data. SN 1990N As there is a big gap in the observations between JD 2448125 and 2448250 all ﬁts had to include data until after 200 days past maximum (not shown) to ﬁx the late decline. Also around the time where the second maximum is expected, there are no data. Those two gaps make it impossible to ﬁt the R and I light curves. The secondary bump is by far overestimated. But there are early pre-maximum data which makes the ﬁts reliable around maximum. SN 1990O There are no pre-maximum data, again a big gap between JD 2448160 and 2448350 and only about 10 observations. Therefore the ﬁts had to be restricted in the number of parameters. All light curves have been ﬁtted without rise and only I with a second Gaussian. SN 1990T There are no observations at maximum, but the B and V light curves can be used for the determination of the late slope and postmaximum data. There are not enough observations for ﬁtting the second peak in R and I well. For I the width of the second Gaussian had to be ﬁxed. SN 1990Y As there are no pre-maximum data, the rise has not been ﬁtted. The B and V light curves can be used for the late slope and for a continuous representation of the postmaximum data. As there are only 10 observations in R, the secondary peak is not reliable. SN 1990af There are B and V observations until 25 days after maximum. Even ﬁtting the V light curve with only one Gaussian produces strange results (small bump 6 days after maximum). SN 1991S The B and V light curves are neither observed at maximum nor at late times. SN 1991T The rise times of U and I are not reliable because there are not enough pre-maximum observations. SN 1991U Only the B light curve could be ﬁtted, but neither the maximum nor the late light curve is observed. SN 1991ag There are no observations at maximum light and there are not enough data in V, I and R for ﬁtting the second Gaussian. SN 1991bg The maximum in B is not observed, but otherwise the light curves could be ﬁtted without problems. As there are no errors given in the literature, a observational uncertainty of 0.1 mag has been assumed. 62 A Catalogue SN 1992A The light curves could be ﬁtted very well, but as in all well observed light curves with enough data, ondulations in the residuals especially in the I band can be seen. This indicates the imperfections of the adopted model. SN 1992J As there are not a lot of observations the light curves can not be ﬁtted well. SN 1992K The maximum is not observed, but the late slope could be ﬁtted well in BV. For the I ﬁt there are not enough data, several parameters had to be ﬁxed. SN 1992P There are no pre-maximum data and there is a gap after maximum. No second Gaussian could be ﬁtted and in I there are not enough observations to get a good representation for the light curve at all. SN 1992ae In B and V the ﬁt can give some hint for the light curve, but there are no observations at maximum light and at later times. SN 1992ag There are neither pre-maximum data nor late observations and the B observations are discrepant by 0.5 mag 30 days after maximum. Fitting a second Gaussian was not possible. SN 1992al No second Gaussian could be ﬁtted in V, but otherwise the light curve ﬁtting had no problem. SN 1992aq Because of the lack of observations at maximum and at late times, the light curves could not be ﬁtted very well. Fitting a second Gaussian was not possible. SN 1992au The SN was not observed at maximum light and not for a long time. Again the light curves could not be ﬁtted well. SN 1992bc SN 1992bc did not make trouble at all. SN 1992bg The observations in I are too sparse to be ﬁtted well, but B and V give continuous representations within the observed epochs, even without ﬁtting the second Gaussian in V. SNe 1992bh, 1992bk and 1992bl Again the second Gaussian in V could not be ﬁtted because of the lack of late and pre-maximum data. The I light curves suffer from not enough observations. SN 1992bo There are not enough data in the time range of the second bump to ﬁt a second Gaussian in V. This observational gap at the time of the second bump makes the secondary maximum in R and I uncertain. SN 1992bp The second Gaussian in V could not be ﬁtted because of the lack of late and pre-maximum data. The I light curves suffer from not enough observations. SN 1992br There are not enough data to ﬁt the second Gaussian in V and difﬁculties in the ﬁt to B light curve because of the early end of the light curve due to the dimness of the SN. SN 1992bs The second Gaussian in V could not be ﬁtted because of the lack of late and pre-maximum data. The I light curves suffer from not enough observations. SN 1993B The second Gaussian in V could not be ﬁtted because there are not enough data. A.2 Annotations to Individual SNe 63 SN 1993H No second Gaussian could have been ﬁtted in R because of a gap of observations around those epochs and no pre-maximum data which would ﬁx the exponential rise. SN 1993O The exponential rise could not be ﬁtted in I. SN 1993ae The maximum was not observed and the width of the second Gaussian had to be ﬁxed in I and R because of a gap in the observations of about 20 days. SN 1993ag The I ﬁt at maximum overestimates the light curve, but the exponential rise had to be included because of the steep late slope and the minimum (see discussion in Section 4.1). In V there are not enough data to ﬁt a second Gaussian. SN 1993ah There are not enough observations for ﬁtting all parameters and a gap of about 40 days. SN 1994D There was no problem in ﬁtting the light curves, but again the ondulations in the residuals can be seen. As observations by different observers with and without errorbars have been compiled, an observational uncertainty of 0.1 mag has been assumed. SN 1994M The second Gaussian in V is not very well sampled and therefore overestimated. SN 1994Q There were not enough data in V, R and I to ﬁt the exponential rise and to get a good continuous representation of the observations. SNe 1994S and 1994T The light curves are sparsely sampled with no late observations. SNe 1994ae and 1995D There have been no problems ﬁtting SN 1994ae and SN 1995D. SN 1995E The second Gaussian could not be ﬁtted in V. SN 1995ac As there are no data later than 60 days after maximum, the width of the second Gaussian had to be ﬁxed. SN 1995ak No exponential rise could be ﬁtted, what is problematic in I, but there are not enough data for ﬁtting 10 parameters. SN 1995al The light curve is sampled well for more than 100 days, but the V light curve is only ﬁtted with one Gaussian. SN 1995bd The second Gaussians (with a ﬁxed width in V) are determined mainly by a single observation. SN 1996C Although there are no pre-maximum data, R and I had to be ﬁtted with exponential rise, I also with a ﬁxed width of the second Gaussian. SN 1996X There have been no restrictions in the ﬁt, but the pre-maximum observations do not constrain the ﬁt well especially in R. SN 1996Z There are only a few observations with a big gap, which could be ﬁtted with one Gaussian only. SN 1996ab The same applies for SN 1996ab, for B even the late slope had to be ﬁxed. 64 A Catalogue SN 1996ai There is a gap around the time of the secondary bump, which makes the secondary Gaussians very undetermined. In I the slope and the width of the second Gaussian has been ﬁxed. SN 1996bk There are big gaps between the sparse observations. Fitting the light curves with only one Gaussian and without exponential rise (besides in B) has been tried. SN 1996bl SN 1996bl is lacking of early and late observations. This makes it impossible to ﬁt a second Gaussian in V.In R and I the slope had to be ﬁxed. SN 1996bo Again the slope had to be ﬁxed in V, R and I. SN 1996bv The observations are very sparse; it was not possible to ﬁt the exponential rise. In I this was necessary so three other parameters had to be ﬁxed. SN 1997br I has not been observed at maximum hence the time of the ﬁrst Gaussian had to be ﬁxed and no exponential rise could be ﬁtted. B has a gap in the observations at maximum light, which lets the ﬁt overestimate the maximum brightness. SN 1997cn Only the V light curve could be ﬁtted with only one Gaussian as in the other ﬁlters there are not enough late time data and the maximum is not observed. SN 1998bu For the JHK light curves (not included in Figure A.59, but shown in Figure 5.4), the slope had to be set to 0, because the light curves do not extend after the second maximum. As the error estimates of the two datasets disagree, the late ﬁt in I is determined by the Suntzeff et al. (1999) data as they give smaller errors. The U and B light curves could be ﬁtted better with a second Gaussian to account for the non-symmetry of the maximum. SN 1998de All light curves have been ﬁtted without a second Gaussian.

This model is ideally suited to objectively evaluate the variety among individual Type Ia Supernova light curve parameters, because it provides a continuous representation of the observational data and avoids a-priori assumptions commonly made. The ﬁlter light curves also can be used to construct bolometric light curves. They form an important link between theoretical models and observations. A number of physical parameters of the supernovae are derived directly from the bolometric light curves, e.g. the amount of 56Ni synthesized during the explosion and the γ–ray transport. Zusammenfassung Lichtkurven von Typ Ia Supernovae wurden mittels einer analytischen Methode untersucht. Deren kontinuierliche Form erm ¨oglicht eine gr ¨undliche Analyse und eine unabh¨angige Pa- rameterstudie. Exemplarisch wurden zwei Parameter – die Epochen der maximalen Hel- ligkeit in Filtern und die Ansteigezeit – eingehend untersucht. Die Filterlichtkurven eignen sich auch zur Konstruktion von bolometrischen Lichtkurven. Diese Gr ¨oße l¨asst einen Ver- gleich mit theoretischen Modellen zu. Auch die Menge des w¨ahrend der Explosion syn- thetisierten 56Ni wurde berechnet und Aussagen ¨uber die Absorption der γ–Strahlung in den Ejekta gemacht. 162 Danksagung An erster Stelle m ¨ochte ich mich bei meinem Betreuer Dr. Bruno Leibundgut daf ¨ur be- danken, dass er mich die gesamte Zeit hindurch mit Ausdauer begleitet und unterst ¨utzt hat.
