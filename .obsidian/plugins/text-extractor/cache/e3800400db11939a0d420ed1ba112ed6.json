We then choose the positions of the ﬁrst letter in “AB” or “BA”. There are 4 choices, namely positions 1, 2, 3, 4. We are left with three positions in which the letters C, D, E can be placed in ay order. The number of ways that this can be done is the number of permutations of these three letters, namely, 3! = 3 · 2 · 1 = 6. Thus, the answer is 2 · 4 · 6 = 48.
