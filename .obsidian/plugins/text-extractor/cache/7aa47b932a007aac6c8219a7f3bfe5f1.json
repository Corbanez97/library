In every case, heat and cold determine, conjoin, and change things. Thus, hot and cold we describe as active, for combining is a sort of activity. Things dry and moist, on the other hand, are the subjects of that determination. In virtue of their being acted upon, they are thus passive.

Writing it has been in my mind for a while. The main reason for wanting to write a book like this was that, simply, no such text in atmospheric thermodynam- ics exists. Do not get me wrong here. Excellent books treating the subject do exist and I have been positively inﬂuenced and guided by them in writing this one. However, in the past, atmo- spheric thermodynamics was either treated at graduate level or at undergraduate level in a partial way (using part of a general book in atmospheric physics) or too fully (thus making it diﬃ- cult to ﬁt it into a semester course). Starting from this point, my idea was to write a self-contained, short, but rigorous book that provides the basics in atmospheric thermodynamics and prepares undergraduates for the next level. Since atmospheric thermody- namics is established material, the originality of this book lies in its concise style and, I hope, in the eﬀectiveness with which the material is presented. The ﬁrst two chapters provide basic deﬁni- tions and some useful mathematical and physical notes that we employ throughout the book. The next three chapters deal with more or less classical thermodynamical issues such as basic gas laws and the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics. In Chapter 6 we introduce the thermodynamics of water, and in Chapter 7 we discuss in detail the properties of moist air and its role in atmospheric processes. In Chapter 8 we discuss atmospheric sta- bility, and in Chapter 9 we introduce thermodynamic diagrams as tools to visualize thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere and to forecast storm development. Chapter 10 serves as an epi- logue and brieﬂy discusses how thermodynamics blends into the weather prediction problem. At the end of each chapter solved examples are supplied. These examples were chosen to comple- ment the theory and provide some direction for the unsolved problems. ix x PREFACE Finally, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Ms Gail Boviall for typing this book and to Ms Donna Genzmer for draft- ing the ﬁgures. Anastasios A. Tsonis Milwaukee CHAPTER ONE Basic definitions • Thermodynamics is deﬁned as the study of equilibrium states of a system which has been subjected to some energy transformation. More speciﬁcally, thermodynamics is concerned with transforma- tions of heat into mechanical work and of mechanical work into heat. • A system is a speciﬁc sample of matter. In the atmosphere a par- cel of air is a system. A system is called open when it exchanges matter and energy with its surroundings (Figure 1.1). In the atmosphere all systems are more or less open. A closed system is a system that does not exchange matter with its surroundings. In this case, the system is always composed of the same point- masses (a point-mass refers to a very small object, for example a molecule). Obviously, the mathematical treatment of closed systems is not as involved as the one for open systems, which are extremely hard to handle. Because of that, in atmospheric thermodynamics, we assume that most systems are closed. This assumption is justiﬁed when the interactions associated with open systems can be neglected. This is approximately true in the following cases. (a) The system is large enough to ignore mixing with its surroundings at the boundaries. For example, a large cumulonimbus cloud may be considered as a closed system but a small cumulus may not. (b) The system is part of a larger homo- geneous system. In this case mixing does not signiﬁcantly change its composition. A system is called isolated when it exchanges neither matter nor energy with its surroundings. • The state of a system (in classical mechanics) is completely speci- ﬁed at a given time if the position and velocity of each point-mass is known. Thus, in a three-dimensional world, for a system of N point-masses, 6N variables need to be known at any time. When 1 2 1 BASIC DEFINITIONS Figure 1.1 In an open system mass and energy can be exchanged with its environment. A system is defined as closed when it exchanges energy but not matter with its environment, and as isolated if it exchanges neither mass nor energy. Mass and energy Open system N is very large (like in any parcel of air) this dynamical deﬁni- tion of state is not practical. As such, in thermodynamics we are dealing with the average properties of the system. If the system is a homogeneous ﬂuid consisting of just one com- ponent, then its thermodynamic state can be deﬁned by its geometry, by its temperature, T , and pressure, p. The geometry of a system is deﬁned by its volume, V , and its shape. How- ever, most thermodynamic properties do not depend on shape. As such, volume is the only variable needed to characterize geom- etry. Since p, V, and T determine the state of the system, they must be connected. Their functional relationship f (p, V, T )=0 is called the equation of state. Accordingly, any one of these vari- ables can be expressed as a function of the other two. It follows that the state of a one-component homogeneous system can be completely deﬁned by any two of the three state variables. This provides an easy way to visualize the evolution of such a sys- tem by simply plotting V against p in a rectangular coordinate system. In such a system, states of equal temperature deﬁne an isotherm. Any other thermodynamic variables that depend on the state deﬁned by the two independent state variables are called state functions. State functions are thus dependent variables and state variables are independent variables; the two do not diﬀer in other respects. That is why in the literature there is hardly any distinction between state variables and state functions. State variables and state functions have the property that their changes depend only on the initial and ﬁnal states, not on the particular way by which the change happened. If the system is composed of a homogeneous mixture of several components, then in order to deﬁne the state of the system we need, in addition to p, V, T , the concentrations of the diﬀerent components. If the system is non- homogeneous, we must divide it into a number of homogeneous 1 BASIC DEFINITIONS 3 parts. In this case, p, V, and T of a given homogeneous part are connected via an equation of state. For a closed system, the chemical composition and its mass describe the system itself. Its volume, pressure, and tempera- ture describe the state of system. Properties of the system are referred to as extensive if they depend on the size of the sys- tem and as intensive if they are independent of the size of the system. An extensive variable can be converted into an intensive one by dividing by the mass. In the literature it is common to use capital letters to describe quantities that depend on mass (work, W , entropy, S) and lower case letters to describe inten- sive variables (speciﬁc work, w, speciﬁc heat, q). The mass, m, and temperature, T , will be exceptions to this rule. • An equilibrium state is deﬁned as a state in which the system’s properties, so long as the external conditions (surroundings) remain unchanged, do not change in time. For example, a gas enclosed in a container of constant volume is in equilibrium if its pressure is constant throughout and its temperature is equal to that of the surroundings. An equilibrium state can be stable, unstable, or metastable. It is stable when small variations about the equilibrium state do not take the system away from the equi- librium state, and it is unstable if they do. An equilibrium state is called metastable if the system is stable with respect to small variations in certain properties and unstable with respect to small changes in other properties. • A transformation takes a system from an initial state i to a ﬁnal state f .Ina(p, V ) diagram such a transformation will be rep- resented by a curve I connecting i and f . We will denote this as i I −→ f . A transformation can be reversible or irreversible. Formally, a reversible transformation is one in which the succes- sive states (those between i and f ) diﬀer by inﬁnitesimals from equilibrium states. Accordingly, a reversible transformation can only connect those i and f states which are equilibrium states. It follows that a reversible process is one which can be reversed anywhere along its path in such a way that both the system and its surroundings return to their initial states. In practice a reversible transformation is realized only when the external con- ditions change very slowly so that the system has time to adjust to the new conditions. For example, assume that our system is a gas enclosed in a container with a movable piston. As long as the piston moves from i to f very slowly the system adjusts and all intermediate states are equilibrium states. If the piston does not move slowly, then currents will be created in the expanding gas and the intermediate states will not be equilibrium states. From this example, it follows that turbulent mixing in the atmo- sphere is a source of irreversibility. If a system goes from i to 4 1 BASIC DEFINITIONS f reversibly, then it could go from f to i again reversibly if the same steps were followed backwards. If the same steps cannot be followed exactly, then this transformation is represented by another curve I ′ in the (p, V ) diagram (i.e. f I′ −→ i) and may or may not be reversible. In other words the system may return to its initial state but the surroundings may not. Any transforma- tion i −→ f −→ i is called a cyclic transformation. Given the discussion above we can have cyclic tansformations which are reversible or irreversible (Figure 1.2). A transformation i I −→ f is called isothermal if I is an isotherm, isochoric if I is a constant volume line, isobaric if I is a constant pressure line, and adiabatic if during the transformation the system does not exchange heat with its surroundings (environment). Note and keep in mind for later that adiabatic transformations are not isothermal. • Energy is something that can be deﬁned formally (we have to wait a bit for this), but its concept is not easily understood by deﬁning it. We all feel we understand what is meant by energy, but if we verbally attempt to explain what energy is we will get upset with ourselves. At this point, let us just recall that for a point-mass with a mass mp moving with speed v in a uni- form gravitational ﬁeld g, Newton’s second law takes the form Figure 1.2 (a) A reversible cyclic process; (b) an irreversible cyclic process. f p p (a) (b) V V I I = reversible I ′ = reversible I = reversible I ′ = irreversible i I ′ f I i I ′ 1 BASIC DEFINITIONS 5 d(K + P )/dt = 0 where K = mpv2/2,P = mpgz, t is the time, and z is the height. K is called the kinetic energy and P is called the potential energy. The total energy of the point-mass E = K + P is, therefore, conserved. If we consider a system of N interacting point-masses that may be subjected to external forces (other than gravity), then the total energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy about the centre of gravity of all point-masses (internal kinetic energy), the kinetic energy of the centre of gravity, the potential energy due to interactions between the point-masses (internal potential energy), and the potential energy due to external forces. The sum of the internal kinetic and internal potential energy is called the internal energy of the system, U . A system is called conservative if dU/dt =0 and dissipative otherwise. For systems considered here we are interested in the internal energies only. CHAPTER TWO Some useful mathematical and physical topics 2.1 Exact differentials If z is a function of the variables x and y, then by deﬁnition dz = ( ∂z ∂x ) y dx + ( ∂z ∂y ) x dy (2.1) where dz is an exact diﬀerential. Now let us assume that a quan- tity δz can be expressed according to the following diﬀerential relationship δz = Mdx + Ndy (2.2) where x and y are independent variables and M and N are functions of x and y. If we integrate equation (2.2) we have that ∫ δz = ∫ Mdx + ∫ Ndy. Since M and N are functions of x and y, the above integration cannot be done unless a functional relationship f (x, y)=0 between x and y is chosen. This relationship deﬁnes a path in the (x, y) domain along which the integration will be performed. This is called a line integral and its result depends entirely on the prescribed path in the (x, y) domain. If it is that M = ( ∂z ∂x ) y ,N = ( ∂z ∂y ) x (2.3) then equation (2.2) becomes δz = ( ∂z ∂x ) y dx + ( ∂z ∂y ) x dy. The right-hand side of the above equation is the exact or total diﬀerential dz. In this case δz is an exact diﬀerential. If we 7 8 2 SOME USEFUL MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL TOPICS now integrate δz from some initial state i to a ﬁnal state f we obtain ∫ f i δz = ∫ f i dz = z(xf ,yf ) − z(xi,yi). (2.4) Clearly, if δz is an exact diﬀerential its net change along a path i −→ f depends only on points i and f and not on the particular path from i to f . We say that in this case z is a point function. All three state variables are exact diﬀerentials (i.e. δp = dp, δT = dT, δV = dV ). It follows that all quantities that are a function of any two state variables will be exact diﬀerentials. If the ﬁnal and initial states coincide (i.e. we go back to the initial state via a cyclic process), then from equation (2.4) we have that ∮ δz =0. (2.5) The above alternative condition indicates that δz is an exact diﬀer- ential if its integral along any closed path is zero. At this point we have to clarify a point so that we do not get confused later. When we deal with pure mathematical functions our ability to evaluate ∮ δz does not depend on the direction of the closed path, i.e. whether we go from i back to i via i I −→ f I′ −→ i or via i I′ −→ f I −→ i (see Figure 1.2). When we deal with natural systems we must view the condition ∮ δz = 0 in relation to reversible and irreversible processes. If, somehow, it is possible to go from i back to i via i I −→ f I′ −→ i but impossible via i I′ −→ f I −→ i (for example, when I ′ is an irreversible transformation), then computation of δz depends on the direction and as such it is not unique. Therefore, for physical systems, the condition ∮ δz = 0 when δz is an exact diﬀerential applies only to reversible processes. Note that since ∂ ∂y ∂z ∂x = ∂2z ∂y∂x = ∂2z ∂x∂y = ∂ ∂x ∂z ∂y it follows that an equivalent condition for δz to be an exact diﬀerential is that ∂M ∂y = ∂N ∂x . (2.6) Equations (2.3)–(2.6) are equivalent conditions that deﬁne z as a point function and subsequently δz as an exact diﬀerential. If a thermodynamic quantity is not a point function or an exact diﬀer- ential then its change along a path depends on the path. Moreover, its change along a closed path is not zero. Such quantities are path functions. For a path function the thermodynamic processes must be speciﬁed completely in order to deﬁne the quantity. For the rest of this book an exact diﬀerential will be denoted by dz whereas a non-exact diﬀerential will be denoted by δz. Finally, note that if δz 2.2 KINETIC THEORY OF HEAT 9 is not an exact diﬀerential and if only two variables are involved, a factor λ (called the integration factor) may exist such that λδz is an exact diﬀerential. 2.2 Kinetic theory of heat Let us consider a system at a temperature T , consisting of N point-masses (molecules). According to the kinetic theory of heat, these molecules move randomly at all directions traversing rectilin- ear lines. This motion is called Brownian motion. Because of the complete randomness of this motion, the internal energies of the point-masses not only are not equal to each other, but they change in time. If, however, we calculate the mean internal energy, we will ﬁnd that it remains constant in time. The kinetic theory of heat accepts that the mean internal energy of each point-mass, U ,is proportional to the absolute temperature of the system (a formal deﬁnition of absolute temperature will come later; for now let us denote it by T ), U = constant × T (2.7) Let us for a minute assume that N = 1. Then the point has only three degrees of freedom which here are called thermodynamic degrees of freedom and are equal to the number of independent vari- ables needed to completely deﬁne the energy of the point (unlike the degrees of freedom in Hamiltonian dynamics which are deﬁned as the least number of independent variables that completely deﬁne the position of the point in state space). The velocity v of the point can be written as v2 = v2 x + v2 y + v2 z. Because we only assumed one point, then the total internal energy is equal to its kinetic energy. Thus, U = mpv2 2 or Ux = mpv2 x 2 ,Uy = mpv2 y 2 ,Uz = mpv2 z 2 where to each component corresponds one degree of freedom. According to the equal distribution of energy theorem, the mean kinetic energy of the point, U , is distributed equally to the three degrees of freedom i.e. U x = U y = U z. Accordingly, from equation (2.7) we can write that U i = AT, i = x, y, z where the constant A is a universal constant (i.e. it does not depend on the degrees of freedom or the type of the gas). We denote this 10 2 SOME USEFUL MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL TOPICS constant as k/2 where k is Boltzmann’s constant (k =1.38 × 10−23 JK −1) (for a review of units, see Table A1 in the Appendix). There- fore, the mean kinetic energy of a point with three degrees of freedom is equal to U = 3kT 2 (2.8) or mpv2 2 = 3kT 2 . The theorem of equal energy distribution can be extended to N points. In this case, the degrees of freedom are 3N and N∑ i=1 mpv2 i 2 = 3NkT 2 or 1 N N∑ i=1 mpv2 i 2 = 3 2 kT or 〈 mpv2 2 〉 = 3 2 kT (2.9) where ⟨ mpv2 2 ⟩ is the average kinetic energy of all N points. Note that the above is true only if the points are considered as monatomic. If they are not, extra degrees of freedom are present that corre- spond to other motions such as rotation about the center of gravity, oscillation about the equilibrium positions, etc. The kinetic theory of heat has found many applications in the kinetic theory of ideal gases. An ideal gas is one for which the following apply: (a) the molecules move randomly in all directions and in such a way that the same number of molecules move in any direction; (b) during the motion the molecules do not exert forces except when they collide with each other or with the walls of the container. As such the motion of each molecule between two collisions is linear and of uniform speed; (c) the collisions between molecules are considered elastic. This is necessary because otherwise with each collision the kinetic energy of the molecules will be reduced thereby resulting in a temperature decrease. Also, a collision obeys the law of specular reﬂection (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection); (d) the sum of the volumes of the molecules is negligible compared with the volume of the container. Now let us consider a molecule of mass mp whose velocity is v and which is moving in a direction perpendicular to a wall (Figure 2.1). The molecule has a momentum P = mpv. Since we accept that the 2.2 KINETIC THEORY OF HEAT 11 Figure 2.1 A molecule of mass mp moving with a velocity v and hitting a surface S.If this collision is assumed elastic and specular, then the change in momentum is 2mpv. V S vdt collision is elastic and specular, the magnitude of the momentum after the collision is −mpv. Thus the total change in momentum is mpv − (−mpv)=2mpv. According to Newton’s second law, F = dP/dt. If we consider N molecules occupying a volume V we can calculate the change in momentum dP of all molecules in the time interval dt by multiplying the change in momentum of one molecule (2mpv) by the number of molecules dN that hit a given area S on the wall, i.e. dP =2mpvdN (2.10) Note that here we have assumed that all molecules have the same speed. The number dN of molecules hitting area S during dt is equal to the number of molecules which move to the right and which are included in a box with base S and length vdt. Since the motion is completely random, we can assume that 1 6 of the molecules will be moving to the right, 1 6 will be moving to the left, and 4 6 will be moving along the directions of the other two coordinates. Since the volume of the box is Svdt and the number of molecules per unit volume is N/V then the number of molecules inside the box is N V Svdt. Accordingly, the number of molecules moving to the right and colliding with S is dN = N 6V Svdt (2.11) From equations (2.10) and (2.11) it follows that dP =2mpv2 N 6V Sdt. 12 2 SOME USEFUL MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL TOPICS Recalling the deﬁnition of pressure, p (pressure = force/area), and Newton’s second law we obtain p = 1 3 N V mpv2. The above formula resulted by assuming that all molecules move with the same speed. This is not true, and because of that mpv2 in the above equation should be replaced by the average of all points, ⟨mpv2⟩. We thus arrive at p = 1 3 N V ⟨mpv2⟩. (2.12) It can easily be shown that by combining equations (2.9) and (2.12), we can derive an equation that includes all three state variables: pV = NkT. (2.13) Equation (2.13) provides the functional relationship of the equation of state f (p, V, T ) and it is called the ideal gas law. More details follow in the next chapter. CHAPTER THREE Early experiments and laws At the end of Chapter 2 we derived theoretically the equation of state or the ideal gas law. This law was ﬁrst derived experimentally. The relevant experiments provide many interesting insights about the properties of ideal gases and conﬁrm the theory. As such a little discussion is necessary. 3.1 The first law of Gay-Lussac Through experiments Gay-Lussac was able to show that, when pres- sure is constant, the increase in volume of an ideal gas, dV ,is proportional to the volume V0 that it has at a temperature (mea- sured in the Celsius scale) of θ =0 ◦C and proportional to the temperature increase, dθ: dV = αV0dθ. (3.1) The coeﬃcient α is called the volume coeﬃcient of thermal expan- sion at a constant pressure and it has the value of 1/273 deg−1 for all gases. The physical meaning of α can be understood if we solve equation (3.1) for α: α = 1 dθ dV V0 . From the above equation it follows that if we increase the temper- ature of an ideal gas by 1 ◦C, while we keep the pressure constant, the volume will increase by 1/273 of the volume the gas occupies at 0 ◦C. By integrating equation (3.1) we obtain the relationship between V and θ: ∫ V V0 dV = ∫ θ 0 αV0dθ or V − V0 = αV0θ 13 14 3 EARLY EXPERIMENTS AND LAWS Figure 3.1 Graphical representation of the first law of Gay-Lussac. p = constant 0 V –273 θ (°C) or V = V0(1 + αθ). (3.2) This is a linear relationship and its graph is shown in Figure 3.1. 3.2 The second law of Gay-Lussac Again through experimentation Gay-Lussac was able to show that for a constant volume the increase in pressure of an ideal gas, dp, is proportional to the pressure p0 that it has at a temperature of 0 ◦C and proportional to the increase in temperature dθ: dp = βp0dθ. The coeﬃcient β is the pressure coeﬃcient of thermal expansion at a constant volume and has the value 1/273 deg−1 for all gases: β = 1 dθ dp p0 . The above formula indicates that an increase in temperature by 1 ◦C (while V is constant) results in an increase in pressure by 1/273 of the pressure the gas had at 0 ◦C. As in the ﬁrst law again it follows that (Figure 3.2) p = p0(1 + βθ). (3.3) Application The second law of Gay-Lussac can easily explain why, in the winter, heating a house at a much greater temperature than the outside temperature does not increase the pressure enough to break the windows. A diﬀerence of 20 ◦C between the inside and the out- side air increases the pressure inside the house by 7.3%. Glass can withstand such pressure changes easily. 3.4 ANOTHER FORM OF THE GAY-LUSSAC LAWS 15 Figure 3.2 Graphical representation of the second law of Gay-Lussac. V = constant 0 p –273 θ (°C) 3.3 Absolute temperature From equation (3.2) it follows that if we extrapolate to θ = −273 ◦C, then V =0. This means that if we were able to cool an ideal gas to −273 ◦C, while keeping the pressure constant, the volume would become zero. Similarly, from equation (3.3) it follows that if we were able to cool an ideal gas to the temperature of −273 ◦C, while keeping the volume constant, the pressure would become zero. This temperature of −273 ◦C we call absolute zero. Up to now for the measurement of temperature the Celsius scale has been used, start- ing from the temperature “zero Celsius”. If we extend the Celsius scale to the absolute zero (i.e. −273 ◦C), then the temperature mea- sured from the absolute zero is called absolute temperature, T . This deﬁnes a new scale called the Kelvin scale (T = 273 + θ). 3.4 Another form of the Gay-Lussac laws Using the absolute temperature we can present the Gay-Lussac laws as follows. From Figure 3.3 it follows from the similarity of triangles ABC and AB′C ′ that his ﬁrst law can be expressed as for p = constant, V V ′ = T T ′ . (3.4) Similarly from Figure 3.4, his second law can be expressed as for V = constant, p p′ = T T ′ . (3.5) Verbally stated, the volumes of an ideal gas under constant pressure and the pressures under constant volume are proportional to the absolute temperatures. 16 3 EARLY EXPERIMENTS AND LAWS Figure 3.3 Expressing Gay-Lussac’s first law for two states C and C ′.

The law is expressed as follows: pV = p′V ′. (3.6) 3.6 Avogadro’s hypothesis The formal deﬁnition of a mole is the amount of substance which contains the same number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons) as there are in 12 grams of 12C. This number of atoms is equal to N =6.022 × 10 23 and it is known as Avogadro’s number. It is obtained under the condition that one mole of carbon weighs 12 grams. In general, a substance of a weight equal to its molecular weight contains one mole of the substance. Thus 25 grams of water contain 27/18 = 1.5 mole of water. In 1811 the Italian physicist 3.7 THE IDEAL GAS LAW 17 and mathematician Amedeo Avogadro proposed his hypothesis that the volume of a gas, V , is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the gas, N ′, V = aN ′ where a is a constant. To relate to this hypothesis, simply imagine inﬂating a balloon. The more the air you pump into it, the bigger the volume. It follows that at constant temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain the same number of molecules. For one mole N ′ = N . Since N is the same for one mole of any gas, Avogadro’s hypothesis (actually a law by now) can be stated simply as: A mole of any gas at constant temperature and pressure occupies the same volume. This volume for the standard state T0 =0 ◦C, p0 = 1 atmosphere has the value (see equation (2.13)) VT0,p0 =22.4 liters mol−1 = 22 400 cm3 mol−1. 3.7 The ideal gas law Let us consider an ideal gas at a state p, V, T which is heated under constant volume to a state p1,V,T ′ (Figure 3.5). Then, according to Gay-Lussac’s second law p1 = p T ′ T . If subsequently we keep the temperature constant and increase the volume to V ′ the gas goes to a state p′V ′T ′. Then, according to Boyle’s law, p′V ′ = p1V. By combining the above two equations we obtain p′V ′ = p T ′ T V or pV T = p′V ′ T ′ . (3.7) This is called the Boyle–Gay-Lussac law and it indicates that if we change the pressure, the volume, and the temperature the value of PV /T remains constant. Thus, equation (3.7) can be written as pV = AT (3.8) where A is, according to equation (3.7), a constant depending on the type and mass of the gas. The dependence on the mass follows 18 3 EARLY EXPERIMENTS AND LAWS Figure 3.5 The three steps used to derive the ideal gas law experimentally. V p p1, V, T ′ p, V, T Isotherm p′, V ′, T ′ from the fact that if we consider twice the mass and keep the pres- sure and the temperature constant, then the volume will double (Avogadro’s hypothesis). Therefore, the value of pV /T (i.e. A) will double. Accordingly, we can write A = mR where m is the mass of the gas and R is a constant independent of the mass but dependent on the gas. This constant is called the speciﬁc gas constant. We can then write equation (3.8) as pV = mRT. (3.9) Since m = Nmp (where N is the total number of molecules each having mass mp), equation (3.9) is identical to equation (2.13) with R = k/mp. Equation (3.9) is thus the equation of state or ideal gas law which is now derived experimentally. Equation (3.9) can be written as p = ρRT where ρ = m/V is the mass density. By deﬁning the speciﬁc volume a =1/ρ, the ideal gas law takes the form pa = RT. If M denotes the molecular weight of the gas then the number of moles is n = m/M . It follows that pV = nM RT 3.8 A LITTLE DISCUSSION ON THE IDEAL GAS LAW 19 or pV = nR∗T (3.10) or pa = R∗ M T where R∗ = MR. Considering that R = k/mp it follows that R∗ = Mk/mp = mk/nmp = Nk/n. Now recall that the number of molecules in one mole, NA, is equal to 6.022 × 1023 (Avogadro’s number). Then, N = nNA. In this case R∗ = NAk, which is the product of two constants. This new constant is called the universal gas constant and its value is 8.3143 J K −1mol−1. 3.8 A little discussion on the ideal gas law • Because the ideal gas law relates three variables (rather than two), we have to be careful when we interpret changes in one of the variables. For example, temperature increases when pressure increases but only if the volume (density) increases (decreases) or remains constant or decreases (increases) by a smaller amount compared with pressure. Let us consider the ideal gas law pV = mRT or p = ρRT and diﬀerentiate it: pdV + Vdp = mRdT dp = RT dρ + RρdT. We can easily see that if dp > 0 and dV ≥ 0 then dT > 0. Also, if dp > 0 and dV < 0 and |Vdp| > |pdV | then dT > 0. And so on! It follows that cold air is denser than warm air only if pressure remains constant or if its change does not oﬀset the temperature diﬀerence. Similarly, if we consider the ideal gas law in the form pa = R∗ M T or p = ρ R∗ M T we can reason that moist air (in which some of the dry air of molecular weight 28 g mol−1 has been replaced by water vapor of molecular weight 18 g mol−1) is less dense than dry air at more or less the same pressure and temperature. This explains some interesting statistics in the American game of baseball where more home runs occur when the weather is hot and humid. In a warmer and more moist environment where p = constant, the density of air is smaller. Therefore, the ball has less resistance. 20 3 EARLY EXPERIMENTS AND LAWS For a path of 400 feet or so the eﬀect can be signiﬁcant, resulting in higher chances for a home run. • Recall equations (2.9) and (3.2). According to equation (2.9) T = 0 K when v = 0. Because of this one might interpret the zero absolute temperature as the temperature where all motion in an ideal gas ceases. On the other hand, when equation (3.2) is extrapolated to the temperature at which V = 0 it results in Tabsolute =(− 1 α ) ◦C= −273 ◦C = 0 K. While this tempera- ture corresponds to vanishing volumes, it is not necessarily the temperature at which motion ceases. If both V = 0 and v =0 are true when T = 0 K, then pressure can be anything, but this does not invalidate the ideal gas law, both sides of which will equal zero. To avoid confusion, we must keep in mind that these issues emerge when these equations are extrapolated to states where one cannot assume that a gas behaves as an ideal gas. At those states, equations (2.9) and (3.2) simply do not mean much. 3.9 Mixture of gases – Dalton’s law Consider a mixture of two gases occupying a volume V and con- sisting of N1 molecules of gas 1 and N2 molecules of gas 2. The total pressure on the walls will be the result of all the collisions, i.e. the collisions by the molecules of gas 1 and the collisions by the molecules of gas 2. Thus we can write equation (2.13) as p = (N1 + N2) V kT or p = N1kT V + N2kT V . The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the above equation is exactly the pressure that gas 1 would create if all its N1 molecules occupied the volume V , i.e. the partial pressure of gas 1. The same is valid for the second term. We thus conclude that the total pres- sure is the sum of the partial pressures. This expresses Dalton’s law which states that for a mixture of K components, each one of which obeys the ideal gas law, the total pressure, p, exerted by the mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures which would be exerted by each gas if it alone occupied the entire volume at the temperature of the mixture, T : p = K∑ i=1 pi. EXAMPLES 21 If the volume of the mixture is V and the mass and molecular weight of the i th constituent are mi and Mi respectively, then for each constituent pi = R∗ Mi mi V T. Applying Dalton’s law, we then can write that for a mixture p = K∑ i=1 R∗T V mi Mi or p = R∗T V K∑ i=1 mi Mi . Since the total mass of the mixture m = ∑K i=1 mi, the above equation becomes p = R∗Tm V ∑K i=1 mi Mi∑K i=1 mi or p = R∗T a ∑K i=1 mi Mi∑K i=1 mi (3.11) In order for the mixture to obey the ideal gas law, it must satisfy the equation p = RT a = R∗T aM (3.12) where M is the mean molecular weight of the mixture. By compar- ing equations (3.11) and (3.12) we see that this would be possible if M = ∑K i=1 mi ∑K i=1 mi Mi . (3.13) This provides the proper way to compute the mean molecular weight for a mixture and indicates that the mixture follows the ideal gas law as long as there is no condensation (if there is, then some mi’s may not remain constant). Examples (3.1) Determine the mean molecular weight of dry air. For our planet, the lowest 25 km of the atmosphere is made up almost entirely by nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), argon (A), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (75.51%, 23.14%, 1.3%, and 0.05% 22 3 EARLY EXPERIMENTS AND LAWS by mass, respectively). Thus, for dry air the mean molecular weight is M = mN2 + mO2 + mA + mCO2 mN2 MN2 + mO2 MO2 + mA MA + mCO2 MCO2 or M = 75.51+23.16+1.3+0.05 75.51 28.02 + 23.14 32.0 + 1.3 39.94 + 0.05 44.01 g mol−1 or M =28.97 g mol−1 or M =0.02897 kg mol −1. It follows that the speciﬁc gas constant for dry air is Rd = R∗/M = 287Jkg −1 K −1. (3.2) Determine the mean molecular weight of a mixture of dry air saturated with water vapor at 0 ◦C and 1 atmosphere pressure. The partial pressure of water vapor at 0 ◦C is 6.11 mb. The mixture consists of dry air and water vapor. If pd is the pressure due to dry air and pv the pressure due to water vapor, then the pressure of the mixture is p = pd + pv.If we recall that the number of moles n = m/M , then we can write equation (3.13) as M = ∑K i=1 niMi ∑K i=1 ni = ∑K i=1 niMi n = K∑ i=1 ni n Mi (3.14) where ni and n are the corresponding number of moles of the constituents of the mixture and the total number of moles in the mixture. Assuming that both dry air and water vapor are ideal gases we have that pV = nR∗T for the mixture piV = niR∗T for each of the constituents. From these two equations it follows that p pi = n ni . Combining the above relationship and equation (3.14) yields M = K∑ i=1 pi p Mi. EXAMPLES 23 In our case i =1, 2. Thus, M = p1 p M1 + p2 p M2 or changing 1 → d (dry air) and 2 → v (water vapor) M = pd p Md + pv p Mv or M = p − pv p Md + pv p Mv or M =28.9 g mol−1. The above estimated mean molecular weight is not very much diﬀerent from the mean molecular weight of dry air. The diﬀerence becomes more apparent for higher temper- atures. For example for T =35 ◦C the partial pressure of water vapor is 57.6 mb and M =28.3 g mol−1 . (3.3) Two containers A and B of volumes VA = 800 cm3 and VB = 600 cm3, respectively, are connected with a tube that closes and opens by a hinge. The containers are filled with a gas under pressures of 1000 mb and 800 mb, respectively. If we open the connection what will the final pressure be in each of the con- tainers? Assume that the temperature remains constant. Once the connection is open, each gas will expand to ﬁll the total volume V = VA+VB thereby equalizing the diﬀerence in pressure between the two containers. Thus the ﬁnal pressure in each container will be the same. Let us ﬁrst assume that container B is empty. Since the gas in container A expands at a constant temperature we have (Boyle’s law) pf Vf = piVi where i and f stand for initial and ﬁnal. It follows that pf = 571 mb. Similarly if we assume that container A is empty the ﬁnal pressure in both containers will be p′ f = piVi Vf = 343 mb. Since pf (p′ f ) is the pressure the gas in A(B) would exert if it occupied the total volume VA + VB,pf and p′ f can be consid- ered as partial pressures of two gases. Then from Dalton’s law it follows that the ﬁnal pressure in each container should be 914 mb. 24 3 EARLY EXPERIMENTS AND LAWS (3.4) If Boyle had observed √pV = constant, what would the equa- tion of state for an ideal gas be? In this case calculate the temperature of a sample of nitrogen which has a pressure of 800 mb and a specific volume of 1200 cm3 g–1. How does this temperature differ from that estimated when the correct law pV = constant is observed? Can you explain the difference? If we follow the procedure to arrive at equation (3.7) but with the new Boyle’s law, we have that p1 = p T ′ T √ p′V ′ = √p1V. By combining the above equations we have that √ p′V ′ = √p √ T ′ T V or √p′V ′ √T ′ = √pV √T = constant. As we know, if we keep the temperature and pressure con- stant and double the mass, the volume will double. As such, here as well the ratio √pV /√T will double. Then we can write that √pV /√T = mR where m is the total mass and R is the speciﬁc gas constant. Thus, the ideal gas law in this case will be √pa = R∗ M √T. Solving for T we have that √T =1.143 or T =1.07 K. Under normal circumstances (i.e. when pa =(R∗/M )T ), we ﬁnd that T = 323.3 K which makes more sense. The tremendous diﬀerence is due to the fact that the square root in √pa = constant introduces two corrections to the ideal gas law (both pressure and temperature appear under a square root) having the net result of signiﬁcantly reducing T .

(3.7) An ideal gas of p, V, T undergoes the following successive changes: (1) it is warmed under a constant pressure until its volume doubles, (2) it is warmed under constant volume until its pressure doubles, and (3) it expands isothermally until its pressure returns to p. Calculate in each case the values of p, V, T and plot all three changes in a (p, V ) diagram. CHAPTER FOUR The first law of thermodynamics 4.1 Work As we have already mentioned, in atmospheric thermodynamics we will be dealing with equilibrium states of air. If a system (par- cel of air, for example) is at equilibrium with its environment no changes take place in either of them. We can imagine the “shape” of the parcel remaining unchanged in time. If the pressure of the surroundings changes, then the force associated with the pressure change will disturb the parcel thereby forcing it away from equilib- rium. In order for the parcel to adjust to the pressure changes of the surroundings, the parcel will either contract or expand. If the parcel expands we say that the parcel performs work on the envi- ronment and if the parcel contracts we say that the environment performs work on the parcel. By deﬁnition, if the volume change is dV then the incremental work done, dW ,is dW = pdV. Accordingly, when the system changes from an initial state i to a ﬁnal state f the total work done, either by the system or on the system, is W = ∫ f i pdV. The above equation indicates that the work done is given by an area ina(p, V ) diagram (Figure 4.1) [or a (p, a) diagram, where a is the speciﬁc volume]. If dV > 0 (the system expands) it follows that W> 0 and if dV < 0 (system contracts) it follows that W< 0. Thus, positive work corresponds to work done by the system on the environment and negative work corresponds to work done to the system by the environment. Now let us consider a situation where the system expands through a reversible transformation from i to f and then contracts 27 28 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Figure 4.1 The shaded area gives the work done when a system changes from an initial state i to a final state f . Vf VVi p pf f W = pdV f i i pi Figure 4.2 The shaded area gives the work done during a cyclic reversible transformation. p W = Ai1f 2i 1 2 Vf VVi f i from f to i along exactly the same path in the (p, V ) diagram. Then, the total work done will be W = ∫ f i pdV + ∫ i f pdV = ∫ f i pdV − ∫ f i pdV =0. If, however, the system expands from i to f and then contracts from f to i but along a diﬀerent reversible transformation (diﬀerent path), then the total work done would be (see Figure 4.2) W = [∫ f i pdV ] 1 + [∫ i f pdV ] 2 = area under curve 1 − area under curve 2 = Ai1f 2i ̸=0 where Ai1f 2i is the area enclosed by the two paths. It follows that∮ dW = ∮ pdV ̸= 0 and thus dW is not an exact diﬀerential, which means that work is not a state function. As such it depends on the particular way the system goes from i to f . Because of this from now on we will denote the incremental change in work as δW not as dW . 4.2 DEFINITION OF ENERGY 29 If we write dV = dAds (where dA is an area element and ds a distance element) we have that δW = pdAds = Fds = Fvdt or that δW dt = Fv or δW dt = m dv dt v or δW dt = d dt ( 1 2 mv2) or δW dt = dK dt (4.1) where v denotes the velocity of the parcel and K is the kinetic energy of the parcel. It follows that the work done and the kinetic energy are related. The last equation indicates that one way by which a thermodynamic system can exchange energy with its envi- ronment is by performing work. The other is through transfer of heat. More on that will follow soon. According to (4.1) the units for work are those of energy. Thus, the unit for work in the MKS system is the joule which is deﬁned asJ=N m where the newton N = kgms−2. In the cgs system, the unit is the erg which is deﬁned as erg = dyn cm where dyn = g cm s−2. It follows that 1 joule = 10 7 erg. 4.2 Definition of energy The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics expresses the principle of con- servation of energy for thermodynamical systems. The idea here is that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only change from one form to another. In this regard if during a transforma- tion the energy of the system increases by some amount, then this amount is equal to the amount of energy the system receives from its surroundings in some other form. Let us consider a closed system contained in an adiabatic enclosure. In this case the energy of the system, U , is equal to the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of all its molecules. The sum of the energies of all molecules depends on the state of the system at a given moment (i.e. on the values p, V, T ) but obviously is indepen- dent of past states. It follows that the internal energy of the system depends on the state in which it exists but not on the way it arrived at that state. Thus, in a transformation i → f, ΔU = Uf − Ui. Then, for a cyclic transformation, ∮ ΔU = 0 which means that for an inﬁnitesimal process dU is an exact diﬀerential. If no external forces are acting upon the system (i.e. the system is at equilibrium 30 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Figure 4.3 The work done by an external force on a system that is taken adiabatically from a reference state O or a reference state O′ to a state A. In this case the work done depends on the initial and final states, not on the particular path from an initial state to a final state. O ′ –W A ad ′ A ad –W A –WO ′ ad O with its environment), then its energy remains the same (ΔU = 0). If some external force acts upon the system taking it from state i to state f then the conservation of energy principle dictates that Uf − Ui = −W ad (4.2) where −W ad is the work done adiabatically by the external force on the system (+W ad is the work done by the system). Note that equation (4.2) implies that the work done in this case depends only on states i and f , not on the particular transformation i → f . This is contrary to what we proved previously – that the work done is not an exact diﬀerential and that it depends on the particular transformation i → f . The discrepancy is due to the fact that here we are dealing with adiabatic transformations. Only in this case does the work done not depend on the particular transformation. Assume now a standard state O of this system where by deﬁnition UO = 0 and a state A where UA ̸= 0. Assume further that through some external inﬂuences we take the system from state O to state A. Then according to equation (4.2) the energy of state A is UA = −W ad A . (4.3) Apparently, equation (4.3) (and hence any deﬁnition of energy) depends on the standard state O. If instead of O we had chosen another standard state O′ we would have obtained U ′ A. In this case (see Figure 4.3) we would have (since W ad depends on initial and ﬁnal states only) −W ad A = −W ad′ A − W ad O′ or UA = U ′ A + UO′ or UA − U ′ A = UO′ where UO′ is the energy of the standard state O′ and thus is a constant. It follows that had we chosen a diﬀerent standard state, U ′ A would diﬀer by a constant (additive) amount. This constant is an essential feature of the concept of energy which has no eﬀect on 4.3 EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN HEAT AND WORK DONE 31 the ﬁnal results when we are working with diﬀerences (changes) of energy and not with actual amounts. 4.3 Equivalence between heat and work done Consider a sample of water at a state i where the temperature is Ti and at a state f where the temperature is Tf >Ti. In how many diﬀerent ways can we take the system from i to f ? Obviously we can simply warm up the system. In this case, and as long as Tf is low enough for evaporation to be negligible, the volume of the system remains unchanged and therefore no work is done by the external forces. This is the ﬁrst way. The second way is to raise the temperature via friction. Just imagine a set of paddles rotating inside the system. In this case, we will observe that as long as the paddles continue to rotate the temperature of the water increases. Since the water resists the motion of the paddles we must perform mechanical work in order to keep the paddles moving until Tf is reached. Thus, the work performed by the system depends on whether we go from i to f by means of the ﬁrst or the second way. If we assume that the principle of the conservation of energy holds, then we must admit that the energy transmitted to the water in the form of mechanical work from the rotating paddles is transmitted to the water in the ﬁrst way in a non-mechanical form called heat. It follows that heat and (mechanical) work are equivalent and two diﬀerent aspects of the same thing: energy. In the ﬁrst way, where no work is performed, the change of energy can be expressed as ΔU = QW =0 where QW =0 is the amount of heat received. In the second way (the experiment can be thought of as taking place in some adiabatic enclosure) the change in energy can be expressed as ΔU = −W ad. When both work and heat are allowed to be exchanged, we replace the above equations by the general expression ΔU + W = Q. (4.4) The quantity QW =0 required to raise 1 g of water from 14.5 ◦Cto 15.5 ◦C is by deﬁnition equal to 1 cal. In this case W ad turns out to be equal to 4.185 J. This value is known as the mechanical equiv- alent of heat. Note that since δW is not an exact diﬀerential, δQ is not either. Thus, for an inﬁnitesimal process the above equation takes the form dU + δW = δQ. (4.5) 32 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Note that for a cyclic transformation ∮ dU = 0 and thus W = Q. Equation (4.5) is the mathematical expression of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. Since δW = pdV we can write the ﬁrst law as: dU + pdV = δQ (4.6) or for unit mass du + pda = δq. (4.7) 4.4 Thermal capacities Since dU is an exact diﬀerential we can write it as: dU = ( ∂U ∂T ) V dT + ( ∂U ∂V ) T dV (4.8) or as: dU = ( ∂U ∂T ) p dT + ( ∂U ∂p ) T dp (4.9) or as: dU = ( ∂U ∂p ) V dp + ( ∂U ∂V ) p dV. (4.10) By combining equations (4.6) and (4.8) we get ( ∂U ∂T ) V dT + [ p + ( ∂U ∂V ) T ] dV = δQ (4.11) By combining equations (4.6) and (4.9) and using the fact that dV = ( ∂V ∂p ) T dp + ( ∂V ∂T ) p dT we arrive at [( ∂U ∂T ) p + p ( ∂V ∂T ) p ] dT + [( ∂U ∂p ) T + p ( ∂V ∂p ) T ] dp = δQ. (4.12) By combining (4.6) and (4.10) we get ( ∂U ∂p ) V dp + [( ∂U ∂V ) p + p ] dV = δQ. (4.13) We deﬁne as thermal capacity, C, the ratio δQ/dT and we denote it as CV if the thermal capacity is measured at a constant V and as Cp if it is measured at constant p. According to this deﬁnition if in a process at constant volume there is no change of the physical and 4.4 THERMAL CAPACITIES 33 chemical state of a homogeneous system, then the heat absorbed is proportional to the variation in temperature δQ = CV dT or δQ = cV mdT where m is the mass of the system and cV is the speciﬁc heat capacity at constant volume (i.e. cV = CV /m). Another speciﬁc heat is the molar speciﬁc heat cVm = CV /n where n is the number of moles. Similarly, at constant pressure δQ = CpdT or δQ = cpmdT. From equation (4.11) if we set dV = 0 we obtain CV = δQ dT = ( ∂U ∂T ) V and (4.14) cV = ( ∂u ∂T ) a . From equation (4.12) if we set dp = 0 we obtain Cp = ( ∂U ∂T ) p + p ( ∂V ∂T ) p . By deﬁning here a new state function, the enthalpy, H = U + pV (h = u + pa), it follows from the above equation that Cp = ( ∂H ∂T ) p and (4.15) cp = ( ∂h ∂T ) p . Again here we can deﬁne the molar speciﬁc heat at constant pres- sure as cpm = Cp/n. Also, since pV = nR∗T , for ideal gases the enthalpy is a function of two state variables (U, T ) and as such it can be expressed as an exact diﬀerential. Note that for isobaric pro- cesses dH = dU + pdV = δQ, i.e. the change in enthalpy equals the amount of heat absorbed or given away. 34 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Figure 4.4 The experimental design of Joule’s proof that U = U (T ). AB Thermometer Calorimeter 4.5 More on the relation between U and T (Joule’s law) As we have stated earlier, any thermodynamical quantity can be expressed as a function of two state variables. As such we can assume that U = f (V, T ). In Chapter 2 we discussed the fact that the kinetic theory of heat accepts that U is proportional to the absolute temperature. This indicates that U is a function of only one state variable, U = f (T ). An experimental proof of this was provided by Joule, who performed the following experiment. He constructed a calorimeter and placed in it a container having two chambers, A and B, separated from each other by a stopcock (see Figure 4.4). He ﬁlled A with an ideal gas and evacuated B. After the whole system settled to a thermal equilibrium (as indicated by the thermometer in the calorimeter), Joule opened the stopcock thus allowing the ideal gas to ﬂow from A to B until pressure every- where equalized. He observed that this did not cause any change in the temperature reading. From the ﬁrst law we thus have Q =0 or from equation (4.4) ΔU = −W. Now note that since the volume of the system (the container) does not change, the system performs no work. As such W = 0 and ΔU = 0. But, you may ask, how about the gas inside chamber A?. Its volume increases as it expands to ﬁll container B. What is the eﬀect of that? Since there was no temperature change and no variation in energy during the process we must conclude that a variation in volume at a constant temperature produces no variation in energy. In other words U ̸= f (V ) which means that U is only a function of T : U = U (T ). (4.16) Later in problem 6.2 you will be asked to prove this mathematically. 4.5 THE RELATION BETWEEN U AND T ( JOULE’S LAW) 35 More on thermal capacities Because of equation (4.16), (∂U/∂T )V = dU/dT . As such we can write equation (4.14) as CV = dU dT (4.17) cV = du dT . Similarly, H = U + pV = U + nR∗T = H(T ) and Cp = dH dT (4.18) cp = dh dT . In the atmospheric range of temperatures, cV and cp are nearly constant. From equation (4.17) we then have that U = ∫ CV dT + constant or U = CV T + constant. Since only diﬀerences in internal energy (and thus in enthalpy) are physically relevant, we can set the integration constant to zero and obtain U ≈ CV T. Similarly H ≈ CpT, u ≈ cV T , and h ≈ cpT . Equations (4.17) and (4.18) can be combined to obtain Cp − CV = nR∗ (4.19) which implies that cp − cV = R, cpm − cV m = R∗. (4.20) Recall now from Chapter 2 (equation (2.8)) that for a monatomic gas consisting of N point-masses the total internal energy is U = 3 2 NkT. It follows that CV = dU dT = 3 2 Nk = 3 2 mR = 3 2 nM R = 3 2 nR∗, 36 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS and cVm = 3 2 R∗,cV = 3 2 n m R∗ = 3 2 R. Similarly, Cp = dH dT = dU dT + nR∗ = 5 2 nR∗, and cpm = 5 2 R∗,cp = 5 2 R. For a diatomic gas these values change to CV = 5 2 nR∗,cV m = 5 2 R∗,cV = 5 2 R and Cp = 7 2 nR∗,cpm = 7 2 R∗,cp = 7 2 R. Note that often in the literature the values of CV and cV m or Cp and cpm are assumed the same. This is correct only in the case of one mole. From the above it follows that Cp CV = cpm cV m = cp cV . We will denote these ratios as γ. Dry air is considered a diatomic gas. According to the above relationships we estimate that for dry air γd =1.4 cV d = 718Jkg−1 K −1 = 171 cal kg−1 K −1 cpd = 1005 J kg−1 K −1 = 240 cal kg−1 K −1 Rd = 287Jkg−1 K −1. According to the above deﬁnitions we can write the ﬁrst law as: CV dT + pdV = δQ (4.21) or cV dT + pda = δq Considering that CV = Cp − nR∗ and that pV = nR∗T , equation (4.21) becomes (Cp − nR∗)dT +(nR∗dT − Vdp)= δQ or CpdT − Vdp = δQ. (4.22) For convenience Table 4.1 summarizes all the diﬀerent expressions of the ﬁrst law. 4.6 CONSEQUENCES OF THE FIRST LAW 37 Table 4.1. Expressions of the ﬁrst law For a gas of mass m For unit mass dU + δW = δQ du + δw = δq dU + pdV = δQ du + pda = δq CV dT + pdV = δQ cV dT + pda = δq CpdT − Vdp = δQ cpdT − adp = δq 4.6 Consequences of the first law Let us look at the form of the ﬁrst law in the following special cases. • Isothermal transformations: i T =constant −→ f During such transformations dT = 0 and as such from equation (4.21) it follows that δQ = δW . Then the amount of heat exchanged is Q = ∫ f i δW = ∫ f i pdV or Q = nR∗T ∫ f i dV V or Q = nR∗T ln Vf Vi . • Isochoric transformations: i V =constant −→ f In this case dV = 0 and from the ﬁrst law it follows that δQ = dU = CV dT or ΔU = Q = CV ∫ f i dT = CV (Tf − Ti). • Isobaric transformations: i p=constant −→ f In this case it follows that δQ = CpdT or Q = Cp(Tf − Ti), δW = pdV or W = p(Vf − Vi). 38 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS and ΔU = Cp(Tf − Ti) − p(Vf − Vi) • Cyclic transformations i −→ f −→ i As we know, in cyclic transformations ∮ dU = 0. Then, from the ﬁrst law it follows that ∮ δW = ∮ δQ. • Adiabatic transformations – Poisson’s relations During an adiabatic process there is no exchange of heat between a system and its surroundings by virtue of temperature diﬀerences between them. Thus, δQ = 0. Then the ﬁrst law can be expressed as dU = −δW or CV dT = −pdV or CpdT = Vdp or dT T = V Cp dp T or using pV = mRT dT T = mR Cp dp p or dT T = nR∗ Cp dp p or using Cp − CV = nR∗ dT T = (1 − CV Cp ) dp p or dT T = (1 − 1 γ ) dp p . (4.23) Integrating equation (4.23) yields ln T = (1 − 1 γ ) ln p + ln(constant) or ln T =ln p γ−1 γ + ln(constant) 4.6 CONSEQUENCES OF THE FIRST LAW 39 Figure 4.5 The various relationships between adiabats, isotherms, isobars, and isochores in partial and in the complete state spaces. p V V (a) (c) (d) p T (b) Adiabat IsothermAdiabat Isochore T T p IsobarAdiabatIsotherm VIsochore Adiabat Isobar or T = constant × p γ−1 γ or Tp 1−γ γ = constant. (4.24) Through the ideal gas law we can then derive the following equivalent expressions of equation (4.24): TV γ−1 = constant (4.25) pV γ = constant. (4.26) Equations (4.24)–(4.26) express Poisson’s relations for adiabatic processes. Since for dry air γ =1.4 > 0 equation (4.25) proves something that we all more or less know: that as an air parcel rises and expands (i.e. V increases), its temperature must decrease. For adiabatic expansion, since δQ is zero this decrease is due to expansion work that the parcel performs on the environment. From the ideal gas law it follows that isotherms are given by the equation pV = constant. Thus on a (p, V ) diagram isotherms are equilateral hyperbolas (Figure 4.5(a); an equilateral hyperbola is one whose asymptotes are perpendicular to each other). From equation (4.26) we see that the adiabats on a (p, V ) diagram will also be equilateral hyper- bolas but since γ> 1 the adiabats will be steeper than the 40 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS isotherms. Obviously in a (p, V ) diagram isobaric and isochoric transformations are represented by straight lines on the p and V axis, respectively. On a (p, T ) diagram the isochores are given by the equation V = nR∗T p = constant ′ or Tp−1 = constant which is the equation of a straight line. From equation (4.24) it also follows that in a (p, T ) diagram the adiabats are again hyper- bolas (Figure 4.5(b)). On a (T, V ) diagram (Figure 4.5(c)) the isobars are straight lines (as before TV −1 = constant) and the adi- abats are hyperbolas (see equation (4.25)). The complete (p, V, T ) space and transformations are shown in Figure 4.5(d). Since they require no heat exchange between a parcel and its environment (i.e. they require perfect isolation), adiabatic processes are idealizations that never happen in nature. However, for processes that happen quickly, energy transfer is not very signiﬁcant. Such processes are thus adiabatic to a good approximation. • Polytropic transformations During an isothermal transformation the system can exchange heat with its environment but its temperature remains constant. This, however, is an ideal situation. In reality the equiliza- tion of temperatures does not happen instantaneously. Simi- larly, an adiabatic transformation is an ideal situation since it requires perfect heat insulation. The same comments can be made for isobaric and isochoric transformations. Thus, the rela- tions pV = constant,pV γ = constant,T p−1 = constant, and TV −1 = constant are special cases of the general relationship pV η = constant where η can take on any value. Such transforma- tions are called polytropic transformations (in Greek polytropic means multi-behavioral). If we assume that η = γ/ϵ where ϵ is a constant, we can work our way backwards from equation pV η = constant or Tp 1−η η = constant to arrive at dT T = (1 − ϵ γ ) dp p . Considering that γ = Cp CV the above equation can be expressed as dT T = ( Cp − CV ϵ Cp ) dp p or dT T = ( Cp − CV − CV ϵ + CV Cp ) dp p 4.6 CONSEQUENCES OF THE FIRST LAW 41 or dT T = ( Cp − CV Cp ) dp p + CV (1 − ϵ) Cp dp p or dT T = nR∗ Cp dp p + (1 − ϵ) γ dp p or dT T = V Cp dp T + (1 − ϵ) γ dp p or CpdT = Vdp + (1 − ϵ)CpT γp dp or CpdT = Vdp − Cp(ϵ − 1) γ V nR∗ dp. Then, according to the ﬁrst law, the second term on the right- hand side is the heat exchanged, which is zero if ϵ = 1 (i.e. η = γ, adiabatic process), greater than zero (i.e. the system absorbs heat from the environment) if η< γ (ϵ> 1) and dp < 0, or η> γ (ϵ< 1) and dp > 0, and less than zero (i.e. the system gives away heat to the environment) if η> γ and dp < 0, or η< γ and dp > 0. From the above equation we also ﬁnd that for ϵ = 0 (i.e. η = ∞) nR∗dT = Vdp, which owing to the ideal gas law implies dV =0. For ϵ = γ (i.e. η = 1), it reduces to CpdT = 0, while for ϵ = ∞ (i.e. η = 0) it dictates that dp = 0. As such a polytropic process pV η = constant reduces to an isobaric, to an isothermal, to an adiabatic, and to isochoric process for η =0, 1,γ, and ∞, respectively. Having said this we must add that in the atmosphere over a rather wide range of motions the timescale for an air parcel (our system) needed to adjust to environmental changes of pressure, and to perform work, is short compared with the corresponding timescale of heat transfer. For example, above the boundary layer and outside the clouds the timescale of heat transfer is about two weeks whereas the timescale of displacements that aﬀect a parcel is of the order of hours to a day. It thus appears that adiabatic approximations are good approximations for many atmospheric phenomena. • Dry adiabatic lapse rate From equation (4.24) we have T = constant · p γ−1 γ . By taking the logarithmic derivative of the above equation we have d ln T = γ − 1 γ d ln p 42 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS or dT T = γ − 1 γ dp p or 1 T dT dz = γ − 1 γ 1 p dp dz . (4.27) For large-scale motions the hydrostatic approximation states that pressure gradient force balances the force due to gravity. Therefore, dp dz = −ρg. (4.28) For a parcel of air rising in the atmosphere, equation (4.27) is valid as long as its ascent is an adiabatic process. For the same parcel equation (4.28) is valid only if dp/dz experienced by the parcel is equal to that of the large scale (surroundings). We assume this is more or less true but in equation (4.28) ρ rep- resents the density of the surroundings which from the ideal gas law is ρ = p RTS (4.29) where TS denotes the temperature of the surroundings. In this case by combining equations (4.27)–(4.29) we have that dT dz = − γ − 1 γ g R T TS . Recall that by deﬁnition an adiabatic ascent or descent is one in which there is no exchange of energy with its surroundings by virtue of temperature diﬀerences between them. Accordingly, if the parcel remains dry (i.e. no condensation takes place) we may deﬁne from the above equation the dry adiabatic lapse rate, Γd,as the atmospheric temperature proﬁle such that the temperature of the parcel is always at the temperature of its surroundings. For such a proﬁle T = TS and as such for dry air Γd = − dT dz = γ − 1 γ g Rd = g cpd =9.8 ◦Ckm−1. (4.30) This value is larger than the observed average decrease of envi- ronmental temperature with altitude. The diﬀerence is mainly due to the fact that in the derivation of Γd we neglected the presence of water vapor. When vapor is present we have new lapse rates, which we will discuss in a later chapter. Recalling that h = u + pa and that h = cpdT we can write equation (4.30) as dh dz = −g 4.6 CONSEQUENCES OF THE FIRST LAW 43 or d dz (h + gz) = 0 (4.31) where h + gz is deﬁned as the dry static energy. The above equations indicate (1) that enthalpy of a parcel decreases as it rises adiabatically because it is doing gravitational work, and (2) that the static energy (the sum of enthalpy and the gravitational potential energy) is conserved in an adiabatic motion (ascent or descent). Enthalpy is thus the speciﬁc internal energy plus the term pa that accounts for the work done by the parcel on the surroundings. • Potential temperature Let us assume that there is a variable θ deﬁned by the relation θ = AT p−β where A and β are constants. By taking the loga- rithm on both sides we get ln θ =ln A +ln T − β ln p. Then by diﬀerentiating we arrive at d ln θ = d ln T − βd ln p. Consider now the ﬁrst law in the form cpdT −adp = δq and divide it by T . Then with the help of the ideal gas we obtain d ln T − R cp d ln p = δq cpT . For β = R/cp the above two equations combine to give d ln θ = δq cpT . (4.32) For adiabatic processes δq = 0 and thus d ln θ = 0. As such we should expect that in adiabatic processes there should exist a measure θ which is conserved. This measure can be deﬁned as follows. From equation (4.24) we have T pk = T0 pk 0 where k =(γ−1)/γ =1−cV /cp = R/cp =0.286 (for dry air). The state (T0,p0) can be taken as a reference state. As such we can choose p0 = 1000 mb and denote the corresponding temperature as T0. The above equation is expressed as T0 = T ( p0 p )k or (4.33) T0 = pk 0Tp−k. 44 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS If we compare the above expression to θ = AT p−β we see that T0 = θ for A = pk 0 and β = k. We call θ the potential tempera- ture and we regard it as the temperature a parcel will have if it is compressed or expanded adiabatically from any state (T, p)tothe 1000 mb level. It follows that the potential temperature remains invariant during an adiabatic process. Thus, under adiabatic con- ditions, θ can be used as a tracer of air motion. On timescales for which a parcel can be considered as adiabatic, constant values of θ track the motion of this parcel, which takes place on a surface of constant θ. From equation (4.33) it is clear that the distri- bution of θ in the atmosphere depends on the distribution of T and p. In the atmosphere dp/dz ≫ dT /dz (just think that 5 km above the surface pressure decreases on the average from about 1000 mb to 500 mb while the temperature decreases from 288 K to 238 K). Therefore, surfaces of constant θ tend to be like isobaric surfaces. Before, we saw that for an ascent (descent) the parcel’s temperature must decrease (increase) owing to the work done by the parcel (by the surroundings). With the deﬁnition of potential temperature we can extend this statement to read as follows: dur- ing an adiabatic ascent (descent) the parcel’s temperature must decrease (increase) but in such a proportion as to preserve the parcel’s potential temperature. Note that equation (4.32) indi- cates that for non-adiabatic processes the change in the potential temperature is a direct measure of the heat exchanged between the parcel and its environment. As a result a non-adiabatic par- cel will drift across potential temperature surfaces in proportion to the net amount of heat exchanged with its environment. Examples (4.1) One mole of a gas expands from a volume of 10 liters and a temperature of 300 K to (a) a volume of 14 liters and a temper- ature of 300 K and (b) a volume of 14 liters and a temperature of 290 K. What is the work done by the gas on the environment in each case? (a) According to the deﬁnition of work W = ∫ V2 V1 pdV = ∫ V2 V1 nR∗T V dV. Since the temperature remains the same the above equation gives W = nR∗T ln V2 V1 = 839 J. EXAMPLES 45 (b) In this case T does not remain constant. As such it cannot be taken outside the integral and the above equation cannot be applied. When T does not remain constant, in order to calculate the work done we must have the explicit function describing the path from i to f in the (p, V ) diagram, not just i and f .An approximation to this would be to deﬁne a temperature T or a pressure p that satisﬁed the relationship ∫ V2 V1 TdV V ≈ T ∫ V2 V1 dV V or the relationship ∫ V2 V1 pdV = p ∫ V2 V1 dV Since in our case no clues are given about the function describing the path from i to f we are free to make (rea- sonable) assumptions. We can thus assume that i and f are connected by a straight line. From the data we can estimate that pi = 249 420 Pa and pf = 172 200 Pa. From Figure 4.6 it is easy to see that the work done is the area of the trapezoid if Vf Vi. Because of the equality of the shaded triangles this area is equal to the area of the rectangle deﬁned by the lines p =0,p = p, V = Vi,V = Vf where p = p1 + p2/2. Thus W = p(Vf − Vi) = 843 J. Figure 4.6 Diagram for example 4.1. p pi p pf Vi Vf V f i 46 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Figure 4.7 Diagram for example 4.2. Vi Vf p pi pf V i m′ f m T = constant (4.2) Consider an initial, i, and a final, f , state of a gas on an isotherm with Vf >Vi. The gas goes from i to f via an isobaric expansion and subsequent isochoric cooling; sketch on a (p, V ) diagram the complete transformation and find the work done. If instead the gas goes from i to f via an isochoric cooling followed by an isobaric expansion, will the work done be different from before? In the ﬁrst case the gas goes from i to m (isobaric from Vi to Vf ) and then from m to f (isochoric from pi to pf ) (Figure 4.7). The total work done from i → f will be the sum of the work done from i → m and from m → f W1 = ∫ Vf Vi pdV + ∫ Vf Vf pdV = pi ∫ Vf Vi dV = pi(Vf − Vi). In the second case the gas goes from i to m ′ (isochoric from pi to pf ) and then from m′ to f (isobaric from Vi to Vf ). As before we have that the total work from i → f is W2 = ∫ Vi Vi pdV + ∫ Vf Vi pdV = pf ∫ Vf Vi dV = pf (Vf − Vi). Since pi ̸= pf it follows that W1 ̸= W2. (4.3) Calculate Q, W , and ΔU for the following processes (Figure 4.8): (a) isothermal reversible compression from state i =(pi,Vi) to state f =(pf ,Vf ); EXAMPLES 47 Figure 4.8 Diagram describing the processes in example 4.3. Isochore Adiabat Isotherm T m′mf i pf pi Vf ViVm p V (b) adiabatic reversible compression from state i =(pi,Vi) to state m =(pf ,Vm) and a subsequent isobaric reversible compression to state f =(pf ,Vf ); (c) reversible isochoric increase of the temperature from state i =(pi,Vi) to state m′ =(pf ,Vi) and a subse- quent reversible isobaric decrease in temperature to state f =(pf ,Vf ). Express all answers in terms of pi,pf , and T , where T is the temperature of the isotherm in (a). (a) During this transformation Ti = Tf = T, ΔT = 0 and ΔU = 0. Then from the ﬁrst law it follows that Q = W = ∫ f i pdV = nR∗T ∫ f i dV V = nR∗T ln Vf Vi = nR∗T ln pi pf . (b) This transformation consists of two branches (i → m and m → f ). From (a), the initial and ﬁnal temper- ature is the same, i.e. ΔU = 0. Thus, again we have 48 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Q = W with ΔU =ΔUi→m +ΔUm→f Q = Qi→m + Qm→f and W = Wi→m + Wm→f . Since the branch i → m is adiabatic it follows that Qi→m = 0 and Wi→m = −ΔUi→m = −CV (Tm − Ti). (4.34) Tm and Ti are related via the equation Tip 1−γ γ i = Tmp 1−γ γ m , where pm = pf . It follows that Tm = Ti ( pi pf ) 1−γ γ = T ( pi pf ) 1−γ γ . Then from equation (4.34) we obtain Wi→m = −CV T [( pi pf ) 1−γ γ − 1 ] . (4.35) Branch m → f is isobaric. Thus, Wm→f = ∫ f m pdV = pf (Vf − Vm). (4.36) Vm and Vi are related via Poisson’s equation as follows piV γ i = pmV γ m. Since pm = pf the above equation becomes ( Vm Vi )γ = pi pf or Vm = Vi ( pi pf )1/γ . Then equation (4.36) can be written as Wm→f = pf [ Vf − Vi ( pi pf )1/γ] = pf Vf [ 1 − Vi Vf ( pi pf )1/γ] EXAMPLES 49 = nR∗T [ 1 − pf pi ( pi pf )1/γ] = nR∗T [ 1 − ( pi pf ) 1−γ γ ] (4.37) From equations (4.35) and (4.37) it follows that overall Q = W = − CV T [( pi pf ) 1−γ γ − 1 ] + nR∗T [ 1 − ( pi pf ) 1−γ γ ] = CpT [ 1 − ( pi pf ) 1−γ γ ] . (c) Here also the transformation consists of two branches, i → m ′ and m ′ → f . Branch i → m ′ is isochoric, so Wi→m′ =0. Branch m ′ → f is isobaric, which gives Wm′→f = ∫ f m′ pdV = pf (Vf − Vm′)= pf (Vf − Vi) or Wm′→f = pf Vf (1 − Vi Vf ) = nR∗T (1 − pf pi ) Here again Ti = Tf = T, ΔT = 0 and ΔU =0. Thus, overall Q = W = nR∗T (1 − pf pi ) . (4.4) This following problem is due to Iribarne and Godson (1973). Students should try to solve it before looking at the solution here. Figure 4.9 shows an insulated box with two compartments A and B. Both compartments contain a monatomic ideal gas and they are separated by a wall that on one hand does not allow any heat through it but on the other hand is flexible enough to ensure equalization of pressure in both compartments.The initial 50 4 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Figure 4.9 Diagram for example 4.4. B A conditions for both compartments are the same: Ti = 273 K, Vi = 1000 cm3, and pi = 1 atmosphere (1013 × 102 Pa). Then, by means of an electrical resistance, heat is supplied to the gas in A until its pressure becomes ten times its initial pressure. Estimate: (a) the final temperature of the gas in B, (b) the work performed on the gas in B, (c) the final temperature of the gas in A, and (d) the heat absorbed by the gas in A. (a) The heat that is supplied to gas in A results in an increase in all its state variables. As it expands, it com- presses the gas in B but it does not provide it with any of its heat because of the insulating wall between them. Since the wall is ﬂexible the gas in B is compressed adiabatically until its pressure equals that inside com- partment A. As such pBf = 10 atmospheres. From Poisson’s equation we can then solve for TBf TBi p 1−γ γ Bi = TBf p 1−γ γ Bf Since the gas is monatomic γ =1.666. Thus, TBf = ( pBi pBf )−0.4 TBi ≈ 686 K. Having TBf we can use the other form of Poisson’s equation to ﬁnd VBf : TBiV γ−1 Bi = TBf V γ−1 Bf or VBf = ( TBi TBf )1/γ−1 VBi = ( 273 686 )1.5 VBi =0.25 VBi = 250 cm3. PROBLEMS 51 (b) The work performed on the gas in B is given by W = −ΔU = −CV (TBf − TBi)= −413 CV J. As we know, for a monatomic gas CV = 3 2 nR∗. The number of moles n can be found from the ideal gas law and the initial conditions. It follows that n = piVi R∗Ti =0.0446 mol. Accordingly, CV = 0.556 J K −1 and W ≈−230 J or W ≈−55 cal. (c) Since the ﬁnal volume in B is 250 cm3 it follows that the ﬁnal volume in A is 1750 cm3. By applying the ideal gas law for the initial and ﬁnal conditions in A we ﬁnd that TAf = pAf VAf pAiVAi TAi = 4777 K. (d) The heat absorbed by the gas in A is given from the ﬁrst law Q =ΔU + W. Here W = 55 cal (i.e. the opposite of the work done on gas B), and ΔU = CV (TAf − TAi) = 2504 J = 598 cal. Thus Q = 598 + 55 = 653 cal.

The ﬁrst law, even though it implies that we can- not create or destroy energy, places no limits on how energy can be transformed from one form to another. Thus, on the basis of the ﬁrst law, heat can be transformed into work, work into heat, work can be done at the expense of internal energy, and so on. However, if no other laws existed the ﬁrst law would allow certain phenom- ena to happen that never happen in reality. For example, consider a heavy body falling on the ground. We will observe that during the impact the body will warm. The opposite phenomenon according to which a body at rest on the ground begins to rise by itself while it is cooling is impossible. Similarly, no engine has yet been built which, for instance, would receive heat from the sea, transform it to work, and then set a ship in motion. Both the above examples are not in disagreement with the ﬁrst law since the work would be done at the expense of the internal energy of the soil or the sea. The impossibility of these phenomena is due to the second law of thermodynamics, often hailed as the supreme law of nature. We will start our discussion of this law with the following example. 5.1 The Carnot cycle The Carnot cycle is a thermal engine. A thermal engine is one that receives from some source an amount of heat, part of which it transforms into work. In thermodynamical terms the Carnot cycle is a cyclic transformation consisting of the following four steps (Figure 5.1): Step 1: reversible isothermal expansion (1 −→ 2),T = T1 = constant Step 2: reversible adiabatic expansion (2 −→ 3),θ = θ1 = constant 55 56 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Figure 5.1 Steps in a Carnot cycle. p θ2 θ1 1 4 2 3 V1 V4 V2 V3 V T1 T2 < T1 Step 3: reversible isothermal compression (3 −→ 4),T = T2 = constant Step 4: reversible adiabatic compression (4 −→ 1),θ = θ2 = constant with T2 <T1,θ2 <θ1. Let us now calculate the work done and heat absorbed when an ideal gas is subjected to this cycle. The change in internal energy is zero because the overall transformation is a cyclic one. We will consider each step separately. Step 1 ΔT =0 W12 = ∫ V2 V1 pdV = nR∗T1 ∫ V2 V1 dV V = nR∗T1 ln V2 V1 ΔU12 = CV ΔT =0 Q12 = W12 Since V2 >V1 it follows that W12,Q12 > 0 indicating that during step 1 work was done by the gas and heat was absorbed by the gas from the heat source at temperature T1. Step 2 Q23 =0 ΔU23 = CV (T2 − T1) < 0 W23 = −ΔU23 = −CV (T2 − T1) > 0 Step 3 ΔT =0 W34 = ∫ V4 V3 pdV = nR∗T2 ln V4 V3 5.1 THE CARNOT CYCLE 57 ΔU34 =0 Q34 = W34 Since V4 <V3 it follows that W34,Q34 < 0 indicating that now work is done on the gas and heat is given away by the gas to the source at temperature T2. Step 4 Q41 =0 ΔU41 = CV (T1 − T2) > 0 W41 = −ΔU41 = −CV (T1 − T2) < 0 From the above it follows that the total work done is W = W12 + W23 + W34 + W41 = nR∗T1 ln V2 V1 + nR∗T2 ln V4 V3 (5.1) Because transformations 2 → 3 and 4 → 1 are adiabatic the following relations apply: T1V γ−1 2 = T2V γ−1 3 and T1V γ−1 1 = T2V γ−1 4 . By dividing the above two equations we have V2 V1 = V3 V4 . Accordingly, equation (5.1) can be written as W = nR∗T1 ln V2 V1 − nR∗T2 ln V2 V1 or W = nR∗ (ln V2 V1 ) (T1 − T2). The total amount of heat absorbed during this cycle is Q = Q12 + Q34 = W12 + W34 (5.2) or Q = W = nR∗ (ln V2 V1 ) (T1 − T2) (5.3) For simplicity we will now denote the amount of heat absorbed by the gas from the heat source at T1 (i.e. Q12)as Q1 and the amount of heat given by the gas to the source at T2 (i.e. Q34)as Q2. Since W is the area enclosed by the cycle it follows that W> 0. Then 58 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS from equation (5.3) it follows that Q> 0. Since W = Q1 + Q2 and Q2 is negative it follows that only part of the heat absorbed by the gas at the source T1 (higher temperature) can be transformed into work. The other part is surrendered to the source at T2 (lower temperature). We deﬁne the eﬃciency of the Carnot cycle, η,as the ratio between the work done and the heat absorbed by the gas at the source T1. η = Q1 + Q2 Q1 =1 + Q2 Q1 (Q1 > 0,Q2 < 0). By considering the relations derived for Q1 and Q2 we can write the above ratio as η =1 + nR∗T2 ln V4 V3 nR∗T1 ln V2 V1 or η =1 − T2 T1 (5.4) 5.2 Lessons learned from the Carnot cycle • According to equation (5.4) the thermodynamic eﬃciency of the cycle depends only on the temperatures of the two heat sources and it becomes zero if T2 = T1 (i.e. if the two sources collapse into one source). As such we conclude that doing work via a thermal engine operating at only one source of heat is impossible. This is known as Kelvin’s postulate and is an expression of the second law of thermodynamics. Another way of stating this postulate is that it is impossible to construct an engine which transforms heat into work without surrendering some heat to a source at a lower temperature. This explains why stones on the ground do not rise in the air or why no machine has been discovered which by taking heat from the sea or the air sets in motion a ship or a car. According to the second law, apart from the warm heat source (sea or air), a second colder heat source would be required which we do not really have. I use the word really because some diﬀerences in temperature do exist in both the oceans and the atmosphere. For example, the temperature of the surface air is around 35 K warmer than the air at 5 km, and the temperature at the surface of the oceans is about 20 K warmer than at a depth of 1 km. In both cases, however, it turns out that the Carnot eﬃ- ciency is about 10%. This is a low eﬃciency given the tremendous expenses that would be required to build such engines. On the other hand if the atmosphere, in the horizontal, is thought of as a Carnot cycle operating at T1 = equatorial temperatures and T2 = polar temperatures we can explain why in the winter the 5.2 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CARNOT CYCLE 59 circulation is stronger. Recall from above that η =1 + Q2 Q1 =1 − T2 T1 or Q1 + Q2 Q1 = T1 − T2 T1 . If we think of summer as the limiting case where T1 − T2 → 0, then during summer Q2 →−Q1 and η → 0. On the other hand if we think of winter as the limiting case where T2 << T1, then during winter η → 1 and Q2 → 0. It follows that the eﬃ- ciency of this “machine” is higher in the winter than in the summer. Accordingly, the amount of heat given by the atmo- sphere to the cold source is smaller in the winter, than in the summer. Since the amount of heat absorbed by the atmosphere from the warm source is more or less constant, this means that there is more heat “remaining” in the atmosphere in the win- ter than in the summer that can be transformed into kinetic energy. Apart from the impossibility of transformations whose only ﬁnal result is to transform into work heat extracted from only one source of heat, there is another type of transformation that is impossible. Such transformations refer to transfer of heat from a cold body to a warm body without work being done. This phenomenon is allowed by the ﬁrst law (since heat lost by the cold body will be exactly equal to the heat gained by the warm body) but has never been observed. Of course transformations that result in heat ﬂow from a colder body to a warmer body are allowed if work is done (such as in refrigerators). This leads to another expression of the second law of thermodynamics. A transformation whose only ﬁnal result is to transfer heat from a body at a given temperature to a body at a higher temperature is impossible. This is known as Clausius’s postulate. It is easy to show that both postulates are equivalent and two expressions of the same law. To do that we shall prove that if Clausius was wrong then Kelvin would be wrong and vice versa. If Kelvin was wrong and we could transform into work heat extracted from only one heat source, then we could transform this work (by means of friction) into heat and with this heat raise the temperature of a given body of a higher initial temperature. This would be a violation of Clausius’s postulate. Now if Clausius was wrong and we could transfer a certain amount Q1 from a source at T2 to a source at T1 (T2 <T1) in such a way that no other change in the state of the system occurred, then with the help of a Carnot cycle we could absorb this amount and produce an amount of work, W . Since the source T1 receives and gives up the same amount of heat (Q1) it suﬀers no ﬁnal change. But 60 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS what we have just described is a process whose only ﬁnal result is to transform into work the heat extracted from a source at the same temperature T2 throughout. This is contrary to Kelvin’s postulate. • From the deﬁnition of eﬃciency it follows that η =1 + Q2 Q1 =1 − T2 T1 T2 T1 = − Q2 Q1 (Q1 > 0,Q2 < 0). Based on the above relationship an important application of Carnot cycle is that it oﬀers a deﬁnition of the absolute tempera- ture (Kelvin) scale based on pure thermodynamic arguments. For this we only need to have a value for a given temperature. An example for such value could be the melting point of ice. As such if we choose for the melting point of ice the value T1 = 273 ◦C every other temperature T2 can be deﬁned via a Carnot cycle operating between heat source T1 (consisting of melting ice) and a heat source T2. If we then measure Q1 and Q2 we can apply the above relationship to calculate T2. This thermodynamic def- inition of the Kelvin scale allows us to present a thermodynamic deﬁnition of absolute zero: the absolute zero is the temperature of a heat source (assumed to be the cold source of a Carnot cycle) which absorbs no heat (i.e. Q2 = 0) even though the cycle produces work. • In reality natural processes are irreversible processes. However, if some processes happen very slowly and the heat losses are small enough not to aﬀect the temperature (which supposes that friction is also negligible), then the results will not diﬀer from those expected from perfectly reversible processes. Such processes are often called partially reversible. If on the other hand fric- tion and heat ﬂow are important then the degree of reversibility decreases. In nature the degree of reversibility varies between almost perfectly reversible and perfectly irreversible. If in a thermal engine we increase the degree of irreversibility (for example, by increasing friction or direct leakages of heat), then the work from a given amount of heat will decrease. If the thermal losses keep on increasing we will end up with a perfectly irreversible engine. It follows that the eﬃciency of a thermal engine can take on values from zero (corresponding to the worst thermal engine operating at perfectly irreversible condi- tions) to some maximum value (corresponding to the best engine operating at perfectly reversible conditions). The Carnot cycle is a perfectly reversible cycle and as such it gives the maximum value the eﬃciency can take. This expresses the Carnot theorem 5.2 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CARNOT CYCLE 61 which states that it is impossible to construct an engine oper- ating between two heat sources which would have an eﬃciency greater than the eﬃciency of a Carnot cycle operating between the same heat sources. However, this maximum value will not be equal to one as this would require that T2 = 0 K which is practically impossible. Recall from section 5.1 that Q1 = nR∗T1 ln V2 V1 and Q2 = nR∗T2 ln V4 V3 . It follows that Q1 T1 = nR∗ ln V2 V1 and Q2 T2 = −nR∗ ln V2 V1 or Q1 T1 + Q2 T2 =0 (Q1 > 0,Q2 < 0) · (5.5) Now by considering equation (5.4) we can, for the reversible Carnot cycle, rewrite equation (5.5) as Q1ηrev T1 − T2 + Q2 T2 =0. Since Q2/T2 is less than zero it follows that Q1ηrev/(T1 − T2) must be greater than zero. Since their sum must equal zero and, as we discussed above, the value of η is maximum for per- fectly reversible processes, it follows that for irreversible processes where η becomes smaller Q1ηirrev T1 − T2 + Q2 T2 < 0. This proves that 2∑ i=1 Qi Ti ≤ 0 where the equality applies to reversible processes. The above argument can be extended to any cyclic transformation in which the system receives heat from or surrenders heat to a set of tem- peratures T1,T2,...,TN (Fermi, 1936). If the amounts of heat exchanged are Q1,Q2,...,QN (positive when heat is given to the system, negative otherwise) it can be shown that N∑ i=1 Qi Ti ≤ 0 62 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS where again the equality applies to reversible processes. In the limit where N →∞ the above equation takes the form ∮ δQ T ≤ 0. (5.6) We may conclude that with the aid of the Carnot cycle we can introduce a quantity, which for reversible processes is an exact diﬀerential. This quantity, δQ/T , is deﬁned as dS, where S is a new state function called entropy. Since δQ/T is, for reversible processes, an exact diﬀerential it follows that for any reversible transformation i −→ f ∫ f i δQ T =ΔS = Sf − Si. (5.7) In other words the change in entropy depends only on the initial and ﬁnal states, not on the particular transformation. This result is fundamental in the formulation of the second law. Since S is a state function it follows that entropy changes are due to changes in both temperature and volume (or pressure). Using the ﬁrst law we have that for a reversible process dS = δQ T = CV dT T + p dV T or dS = CV dT T + nR∗ dV V or dS CV = dT T + nR∗ CV dV V or dS CV = dT T +(γ − 1) dV V or Sf = Si + CV ln ( Tf V γ−1 f TiV γ−1 i ) . (5.8) Equation (5.8) provides the change in entropy of an ideal gas (since the ideal gas law was used) as a function of the initial and ﬁnal temperature and volume. This relation cannot, therefore, be used for liquids or solids. For liquids or solids CV ≡ Cp = C and one can show (but we will not go into this proof here) that in this case the entropy change is dominated by the temperature change. As such for liquids or solids and for reversible processes Sf − Si = C ln Tf Ti (5.9) 5.3 MORE ON ENTROPY 63 5.3 More on entropy As in the case of energy, we will choose an arbritary equilibrium state O as the standard state where by deﬁnition SO is zero. Then we will deﬁne the entropy SA of an equilibrium state A as SA = ∫ A O δQ T where the integral is taken over a reversible transformation. It can easily be shown that if instead of a standard state O we had chosen a standard state O′ then the entropy of state A would diﬀer from the original one by an additive constant: from the above equation we have S′ A = ∫ A O′ δQ T . From equation (5.7) it follows that S′ A = SA − SO′ or SA − S′ A = SO′. Since O′ is ﬁxed, SO′ is some constant. The entropy is thus deﬁned except for an additive constant. As in the case of energy this does not present a problem as long as we are dealing with diﬀerences, not actual values of entropy. Now let us consider the cyclic trans- formation shown in Figure 5.2. The path i R −→ f represents a reversible transformation and the path f I −→ i represents an irre- versible transformation. As we know, for any cycle ∮ δQ/T ≤ 0. As such ∮ iRf Ii δQ T ≤ 0 or [∫ f i δQ T ] R + [∫ i f δQ T ] I ≤ 0. Figure 5.2 A cyclic transformation consisting of a reversible part from i to f (R) and an irreversible part from f to i(I). I f R i 64 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Since i R −→ f is reversible we have that Sf − Si = [∫ f i δQ T ] R . Combining the last two equations leads to Sf − Si + [∫ i f δQ T ] I ≤ 0 or [∫ i f δQ T ] I ≤ Si − Sf . By interchanging i and f we conclude that for any process ∫ f i δQ T ≤ Sf − Si (5.10) or ΔS ≥ ∫ f i δQ T (5.11) or dS ≥ δQ T (5.12) where the equality applies to reversible processes only. Equation (5.12) is the general expression of the second law of thermody- namics and it indicates that the upper bound to the heat that can be absorbed by the system during a given change is δQ = TdS. For a completely isolated system (δQ = 0) equation (5.10) translates to Sf ≥ Si. (5.13) This is an important conclusion as it indicates that for any spon- taneous irreversible transformation (i.e. one not related to external inﬂuences) occurring in an isolated system, the ﬁnal entropy is greater than the initial entropy. It follows that when an isolated system has attained a state of maximum entropy it cannot undergo any further transformation because any change would decrease its entropy, and this is not allowed by equation (5.13). Thus the state of maximum entropy is a state of stable equilibrium. Note that if the isolated system consists of a number of microscopic subsystems it would be possible for some of the subsystems to reduce their entropy but only at the expense of the rest of the subsystems, whose entropy must increase enough that the over- all entropy of the system increases. A perfect isolated system is our universe (assuming that no other universes exist with which our universe can interact). It follows that the entropy of our uni- verse increases in time. Equations (5.10)–(5.12) as well as equation 5.4 SPECIAL FORMS OF THE SECOND LAW 65 (5.13) are the basic mathematical expressions of the second law of thermodynamics. 5.4 Special forms of the second law Given the above deﬁnitions of the second law we can derive its expression for special cases such as the following. • Finite isothermal transformations (ΔU =0) From equation (5.11) it follows that in this case ΔS ≥ 1 T ∫ f i δQ or ΔS ≥ Q T or ΔS ≥ W T . (5.14) • Adiabatic transformations Using equation (5.12) we obtain dS ≥ 0. (5.15) • Isentropic transformations An isentropic transformation is one during which the entropy does not change. In this case it is clear that (recall equation (5.12)) δQ ≤ 0. (5.16) Note that according to equation (5.15) a reversible adiabatic process is isentropic. • Isochoric transformations From the ﬁrst law we have that when dV = 0 then δQ = CV dT . As such for isochoric transformations dS ≥ CV dT T or ΔS ≥ CV ln Tf Ti . (5.17) • Isobaric transformations In this case δQ = CpdT and it follows that dS ≥ Cp dT T 66 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS or ΔS ≥ Cp ln Tf Ti . (5.18) From equation (5.14) it follows that irreversible work increases a system’s entropy. From equation (5.17) it follows that in the absence of work the change in entropy depends on the relation between Tf and Ti. 5.5 Combining the first and second laws Consider the following form of the ﬁrst law: δQ = CpdT − V dp. Combining the above equation with dS ≥ δQ T yields TdS ≥ CpdT − V dp. Recalling that Cp = dH/dT we can reduce the above equation to TdS ≥ dH − Vdp or dH ≤ TdS + V dp. (5.19) Similarly, from δQ = CV dT + pdV we arrive at TdS ≥ dU + δW or dU ≤ TdS − pdV. (5.20) It is often convenient to introduce two new functions: the Helmholtz function F = U − TS and the Gibbs function G = H − TS = U + pV − TS. Since S = S(T, V ) and U = U (T ) it follows that both F and G are state functions (i.e. F = F (T, V ),G = G(T, V )), and thus are exact diﬀerentials. The advantage of these functions is that they can be used to express equations (5.19) and (5.20) in a form where the pairs (T, p) and (T, V ) appear as the independent vari- ables instead of the pairs (S, p) and (S, V ). In this case equations (5.20) and (5.19) can be written as: dF ≤−SdT − pdV (5.21) and dG ≤−SdT + V dp. (5.22) The interpretation of the above functions is that for isothermal processes dF ≤−δQ or dF ≤−δW which makes F the energy 5.6 SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE SECOND LAW 67 available for conversion into work. The usefulness of G becomes clearer for isothermal-isobaric transformations. During such trans- formations (which apply in phase transitions, for example water to vapor) dG = 0 and therefore G is conserved. Relations (5.19)–(5.22) are often referred to as the fundamental relations. 5.6 Some consequences of the second law Thermodynamic definition of temperature As we know, the integral ∫ f i δQ depends on the path from i to f , not just the states i and f . In this chapter we showed that the integral ∫ f i δQ/T depends only on the initial and ﬁnal states, not on the particular path from i to f . As such 1/T is the integration factor that makes δQ an exact diﬀerential. It follows that in ther- modynamical terms temperature is the inverse of the integration factor of the diﬀerential of heat in reversible processes. The statistical nature of thermodynamics The change in entropy during a reversible cooling at constant pressure of m grams of dry air from T1 to T2 (T1 >T2)is ΔS = ∫ T2 T1 δQ T . Since p = constant we have that δQ = mcpddT where cpd is the speciﬁc heat capacity of dry air. It follows that ΔS = ∫ T2 T1 mcpd dT T or assuming that cpd does not vary signiﬁcantly with temperature ΔS = ST2 − ST1 = mcpd ln T2 T1 . Since m and cpd are greater than zero and ln T2 T1 < 0 it follows that ΔS< 0. Thus, the entropy decreases during the cooling. This decrease does not violate the second law. Even though the dry air decreases its entropy the environment that provided the heat suﬀers a positive change so that the overall entropy change of the system is positive. We can extend the above arguments to show that as the temperature goes down so does the entropy (or as temperature goes up so does the entropy). The question is why and what is the physical meaning of this. Kinetic theory provides an explanation for the above. According to the theory, at very low temperatures the motion of the molecules is very slow with the molecules being 68 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Figure 5.3 The situation in (a) represents greater order and a lower number of complexions than in (b) where the number of complexions and disorder have increased. (a) (b) N1 = N N1 = N/2 N2 = N/2 A B A B N2 = 0 more or less uniformly distributed in space. This is a picture of a high order, with complete order (motionless molecules uniformly spaced) presumably achieved at absolute zero. As the temperature increases the motion of the molecules increases and the order is soon destroyed. If we combine this with the above result it follows that we can associate entropy with order or disorder. Accordingly, decreas- ing entropy implies increasing order and increasing entropy implies increasing disorder. This association justiﬁes the word entropy, which in Greek means the “inner behavior” (ϵντρoπ´ια). Now if such an association is correct we should be able to ﬁnd a measure that deﬁnes disorder which should be mathematically related to entropy. Let us consider a volume V consisting of two compartments A and B, with N total particles moving around. Let us denote with N1 the number of particles in compartment A and with N2 the number of particles in compartment B. Statistics tells us that the number of diﬀerent ways, P , in which N1 particles will be found in A and N2 particles in B is P = N ! N1!N2! . (5.23) Now consider two cases as shown in Figure 5.3. In the ﬁrst case all particles are found in A (Figure 5.3(a)), and in the second case the particles are all over the box (Figure 5.3(b)). The ﬁrst case (N1, = N, N2 = 0) obviously represents a state of more order than the second where it can be assumed that N1 = N2 = N/2. Applying equation (5.23) to both cases yields Case 1: P = N ! N !0! =1 5.6 SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE SECOND LAW 69 Case 2: P = N ! N/2! N/2! ≫ 1. We thus see that we have a measure P (often called the number of complexions) that increases as disorder increases. If we consider the ﬁrst case as the initial state and the second case as the ﬁnal state we can conclude (since i → f is an irreversible process) that as the entropy increases P increases. So P is a possible candidate to relate disorder to entropy. But how can we ﬁnd their functional relationship? The derivation of this relationship (one of the most beautiful yet simplest ones) is due to Boltzmann (Fermi, 1936). From the above we saw that as S increases, P increases and vice versa. So let us start with a general relationship of the form S = f (P ). Next, consider a system consisting of two subsystems and let S1 and S2 be the entropies and P1 and P2 the corresponding number of complexions. Then, S1 = f (P1) and S2 = f (P2). For the whole system we can then write that S = S1 + S2 and P = P1P2 or f (P1P2)= f (P1)+ f (P2) i.e. the function f obeys the functional equation f (xy)= f (x)+ f (y). Since the above equation is true for all values of x and y we may take y =1 + ϵ with ϵ ≪ 1. Then we can write it as f (x + xϵ)= f (x)+ f (1 + ϵ). (5.24) Expanding both sides of the above equation using Taylor’s theorem and neglecting terms higher than ﬁrst order we get f (x)+ xϵf ′(x)= f (x)+ f (1) + ϵf ′(1) (5.25) where f ′ indicates the ﬁrst derivative. For ϵ = 0 from equation (5.24) we have that f (1) = 0. Therefore, equation (5.25) reduces to xϵf ′(x)= ϵf ′(1) or xf ′(x)= f ′(1). 70 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Since f ′(1) is a derivative evaluated at a value of 1 it is a constant. Thus xf ′(x)= k or f ′(x)= k x or f (x)= ∫ k x dx or f (x)= k ln x + constant or by changing x → P , S = k ln P + constant. (5.26) This equation relates order and entropy and constitutes a funda- mental relationship connecting statistical mechanics and thermo- dynamics, thereby giving thermodynamics a statistical character. Entropy and potential temperature Recall that the potential temperature θ is given by θ = T ( 1000 p )R/cp . By taking the logarithms of both sides we obtain ln θ =ln T + R cp ln 1000 − R cp ln p or cpd ln θ = cpd ln T − Rd ln p. (5.27) From the ﬁrst law we have δQ = CpdT − Vdp or δQ T = Cp dT T − V dp T or δQ T = Cp dT T − mR dp p or (for reversible processes) ds = cp dT T − R dp p (5.28) 5.6 SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE SECOND LAW 71 Figure 5.4 A hypothetical upper-level flow and the trajectory followed by a parcel. TRE (λ) 1 2 3 N where ds is the speciﬁc entropy. Combining (5.28) and (5.27) leads to ds = cpd ln θ (5.29) or s = cp ln θ + constant. (5.30) Thus, except for an additive constant, the speciﬁc entropy of a sys- tem is given by the logarithm of the potential temperature. When θ remains constant the entropy remains constant. It follows that a reversible adiabatic process is isentropic. For an irreversible adia- batic process ds > 0,dθ = 0. In this case, the increase in entropy comes from irreversible work (for example, dissipation of kinetic energy due to friction). It follows that an isentropic process is adiabatic, but an adiabatic process may not be isentropic. Atmospheric motions Figure 5.4 shows a hypothetical upper-level ﬂow close to some lat- itude λ. Along this latitude the radiative-equilibrium temperature TRE(λ) is assumed to be the same. Such thermal structure can be achieved if the motion is completely zonal (i.e. parallel to lati- tude circles), since air parcels then have inﬁnite time to adjust to local thermal equilibrium. If at position 1 a parcel is allowed to move with the ﬂow two possibilities exist. If the motion is very slow the parcel has time to come into equilibrium with its sur- roundings, so its temperature diﬀers from TRE only inﬁnitesimally. Therefore, we can assume that heat transfer along the trajectory of the parcel is reversible. Then for positions 1 and 2 we have that ∫ 2 1 cpd ln θ = ∫ 2 1 ds = ∫ 2 1 δq T . 72 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS If we assume that δq depends only on the parcel’s temperature (for example, δq = Tf (T )) then we can write the above equation as ∫ 2 1 cpd ln θ = ∫ 2 1 df (T )= f (T2) − f (T1). Since T2 = T1 = TRE the above relationship reduces to ∫ 2 1 cpd ln θ =0 or θ2 = θ1. Thus, the parcel is restored to its initial thermodynamic state when it returns to the original latitude. Since θ depends on p and p depends on height it follows that under the slow motion condi- tions, successive crossings of the initial latitude result in zero net vertical motion and zero heat transfer. On the other hand if the motion is fast enough that reversibility cannot be assumed, then ∫ 2 1 cpd ln θ< ds ̸=0 and therefore θ2 ̸= θ1. In this case when the parcel returns to the initial latitude it is displaced vertically and the net heat trans- fer is not zero. Vertical motion resulting from irreversibility in the atmosphere plays an important role in maintaining meridional circulations, heat and moisture transfer, etc. Examples (5.1) Imagine a volume V divided into two smaller volumes V1 and V2 by a partition. Assume that m1 grams of an ideal gas at temperature T1 occupy volume V1 and m2 grams of another ideal gas at temperature T2 occupy volume V2. Then the partition is removed. If the specific heat capacities at constant volume of the gases are cV1 and cV2, find (a) the limiting temperature of the mixture, and (b) the change in entropy for each gas and for the system as a whole. (a) We assume that while the two gases exchange heat between them and perform work, the system as a whole does not exchange heat with its surroundings and its volume remains constant (V = V1 + V2). In other words for the whole system the process of mixing is adiabatic, with no work being done. As such, ΔU = 0. The total internal energy before mixing is CV1T1 + CV2T2 and EXAMPLES 73 after the mixing it is CV1T + CV2T (here we have made use of the approximation U ≈ CV T + constant and then neglected the constant). Since ΔU = 0 it follows that CV1T1 + CV2T2 = CV1T + CV2T which yields T = CV1 CV1 + CV2 T1 + CV2 CV1 + CV2 T2. (5.31) Considering that CV1 = cV1m1 and CV2 = cV2m2 the above equation becomes T = cV1m1 cV1m1 + cV2m2 T1 + cV2m2 cV1m1 + cV2m2 T2 (b) From equation (5.8) and the additive property of entropy it follows that for each gas the total entropy change is the sum of the entropy change due to the temperature change of the gas alone and the entropy change due to the volume change of the gas alone, i.e. ΔS1 =ΔS1T +ΔS1V ΔS2 =ΔS2T +ΔS2V where the lower limits for ΔS1T , ΔS1V , ΔS2T , and ΔS2V are given by (recall equation 5.8) ΔS1T = CV1 ln T T1 ΔS2T = CV2 ln T T2 ΔS1V = CV1 ln ( V1 + V2 V1 )γ1−1 = m1R1 ln V1 + V2 V1 and ΔS2V = CV2 ln ( V1 + V2 V2 )γ2−1 = m2R2 ln V1 + V2 V2 where R1 and R2 are the speciﬁc gas constants of the two gases. For the system as a whole the lower limit for the total entropy change is ΔS =ΔS1 +ΔS2 or ΔS =(ΔS1T +ΔS2T )+(ΔS1V +ΔS2V )=ΔST +ΔSV 74 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS or ΔS = [ cV1m1 ln T T1 + cV2m2 ln T T2 ] (5.32) + [ m1R1 ln V1 + V2 V1 + m2R2 ln V1 + V2 V2 ] . In equation (5.32) the second term on the right-hand side (ΔSV ) is necessarily greater than zero. The ﬁrst term (ΔST ) is either positive or zero when T1 = T2 (see problem 5.13). As such for the whole system ΔS> 0 which according to (5.12) indicates irreversible process. This proves that mixing is irreversible. (5.2) Calculate the change in air pressure if the specific entropy decreases by 0.05 J g–1 K–1 and the air temperature decreases by 5%. Assuming that the process is reversible we have dS = Cp dT T − V T dp = Cp dT T − nR∗ dp p . Since we do not have any information on the mass of the air involved in the process we will write the above per unit mass: ds = cp dT T − R dp p or dp p = cp R dT T − ds R or considering the air as dry ln pf pi = 1005 287 ln ( 0.95Ti Ti ) − (−50) 287 or pf =0.994 Pi The pressure will decrease by a small amount of about 0.6%. (5.3) In example 4.3, what is the change in entropy in each of the three transformations? (a) The ﬁrst transformation is an isothermal reversible compression. Thus, EXAMPLES 75 ΔS = ∫ f i δQ T = 1 T ∫ f i δQ = Q T = nR∗ ln Vf Vi = nR∗ ln pi pf . (b) The second transformation consists of two branches. The ﬁrst one is a reversible adiabatic transforma- tion. Thus, the entropy change in the ﬁrst branch is zero. The second branch is an isobaric reversible com- pression. As such the entropy change of the second transformation is (recall that since Ti and Tf lie on the same isothermal Ti = Tf = T ) ΔS = ∫ f m δQ T = Cp ∫ f m dT T = Cp ln Tf Tm = Cp ln Ti Tm = Cp ln ( pf pi ) 1−γ γ = −nR∗ ln pf pi = nR∗ ln pi pf (c) The third transformation also consists of two branches: one reversible isochoric and one reversible isobaric. The total change in entropy is the sum of the changes in entropy in the two branches ΔS =ΔS1 +ΔS2 = ∫ m ′ i δQ T + ∫ f m′ δQ T = ∫ m ′ i CV dT T + ∫ f m′ Cp dT T = CV ln Tm′ Ti + Cp ln Tf Tm′ During this transformation piVi = nR∗Ti and pf Vi = nR∗Tm′.Thus Tm′ = pf pi Ti. If we substitute the above value of Tm′ in the previous equation we obtain ΔS = CV ln pf pi + Cp ln Tf Ti pi pf . Since Tf = Ti = T it follows that ΔS = CV ln pf pi + Cp ln pi pf 76 5 THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS or ΔS = nR∗ ln pi pf . Thus, in all transformations the change in entropy is the same. Problems (5.1) Starting from the ﬁrst law show that δQ/T is an exact diﬀerential. (5.2) Derive the so-called Maxwell relations for reversible pro- cesses ( ∂T ∂V ) S = − ( ∂p ∂S ) V ( ∂S ∂V ) T = ( ∂p ∂T ) V ( ∂T ∂p ) S = ( ∂V ∂S ) p ( ∂S ∂p ) T = − ( ∂V ∂T ) p .

CHAPTER SIX Water and its transformations The fundamental equations derived in the previous chapter can only be applied to closed systems (i.e. to systems that do not exchange mass) that are homogeneous (i.e. they involve just one phase). In such cases we do not need to specify how thermodynamic functions depend on the composition of the system. Only two independent variables (T and p,or p and V ,or p and T ) need to be known. Since the total mass (m) remains constant, if we know the values of the extensive variables per unit mass we can extend the equa- tions to any mass by multiplying by m or by n (the number of moles). A heterogeneous system involves more than a single phase. In this case we are concerned with the conditions of internal equilibrium between the phases. Even if the heterogeneous system is assumed to be (as a whole) a closed system the phases constitute homogeneous but open “subsystems” which can exchange mass between them. In this case the fundamental equations must be modiﬁed to include extra terms to account for the mass exchanges. These extra terms involve a function μ called the chemical potential, μ = μ(T, p). We will not go into the details of deﬁning μ; we will only accept that in the case of open systems something else must be included to account for the heterogeneity of the system. In this book we are concerned with a heterogeneous system that involves dry air (N2,O2,CO2, Ar) and water, with the water existing in vapor and possibly one of the condensed phases (water or ice). Then one component of the system is the dry air (which is assumed to remain always unchanged and in a gaseous state) and the other component is the water substance which can exist in two phases. Thus dry air is a closed system whereas the two phases are two open systems. The system composed of dry air, water vapor, liquid water, and ice is also of interest but it is quite unstable and as a result it cannot exist in equilibrium. 79 80 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS 6.1 Thermodynamic properties of water In this chapter we will put aside dry air and we will concentrate on the one-component heterogeneous system “water” comprised of vapor and one of the condensed phases. Water vapor, like dry air, can be treated to a good approximation as an ideal gas. Accordingly, water vapor obeys the equation of state and if it existed only by itself its states would be determined by two independent variables. When, however, water vapor coexists with liquid water or ice things become a little complicated (or less complicated depending on the point of view). In this case, the mixture does not constitute an ideal gas and the equations applicable to ideal gases do not apply. One phase requires two independent variables (p and T ) and the other phase two more (p′ and T ′). Then, equilibrium between the phases will require that p = p′ and T = T ′. However, since the mass of each open subsystem does not remain constant another criterion for equilibrium must be considered. This criterion is given by μ = μ ′ and expresses equilibrium in the terms responsible for the mass exchange. Accordingly, for equilibrium between the two phases the following three constraints must be satisﬁed: p = p′ T = T ′ μ = μ ′. The ﬁrst two equations reduce the number of independent variables to two (say p and T ). Then, the third equation μ = μ(p, T )= μ ′(p′,T ′)= μ ′(p, T ) reduces the number of independent variables by one more. Since μ(p, T )= μ ′(p, T ) it follows that p = f (T ). Thus, if we ﬁx the temperature at which the phases exist in equilibrium the value of pressure also becomes ﬁxed. This deﬁnes curves along which equilibrium between two phases can exist. We conclude that in the case of a one-component system involving two phases in equilibrium the number of independent variables (otherwise known as degrees of freedom) is one, not four. Let us now consider the case of a one-component system involving all its phases (vapor, liquid, solid). Following the same arguments as above the following constraints must be satisﬁed for equilibrium p = p′ = p′′ T = T ′ = T ′′ μ = μ ′ = μ ′′. Then the ﬁrst two equations reduce the number of independent variables from six to two. The ﬁrst equality of the third equation reduces them by one more and the second equality by yet one more. 6.1 THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF WATER 81 Thus, we remain with zero independent variables, meaning that all values are ﬁxed, which implies that coexistence of all phases at equi- librium requires just a point, called the triple point, in the p, V, T state space. It follows that the greater the number of phases the fewer the degrees of freedom. The following formula suggested by Gibbs generalizes the above as it gives the number of independent state variables, N , for a heterogeneous system involving C diﬀerent and non-reactive components in a total of P phases: N = C +2 − P. (6.1) Figure 6.1 shows the triple point for water as well as the curves p = f (T ) representing the phase transition equilibria. We call the three equilibria vaporization (gas ↔ liquid), fusion (liquid ↔ ice), and sublimation (gas ↔ solid). Along the curves for vaporiza- tion and sublimation, vapor is in equilibrium with water and ice, respectively. As such these curves provide the equilibrium vapor pressure for water and ice. Vapor in equilibrium with a condensed phase is often called saturated and the corresponding equilibrium vapor pressure is called saturation vapor pressure. There is no real distinction between the two terms. Note that the extension of the vaporization curve to temperatures below the triple point corre- sponds to supercooled water, with vapor pressure over supercooled water being greater than that over ice. This is a metastable equi- librium where supercooled water and water vapor coexist. Here the system of supercooled water and water vapor may be stable with respect to small changes in temperature and pressure but intro- duction of ice in the system makes it unstable and as a result water freezes. The triple point corresponds to pt =6.11 mb and T = 273 K (more accurately 273.16 K). Because of the diﬀerent densities of liquid water, ice, and water vapor, the speciﬁc volumes for liquid Figure 6.1 Phase-transition equilibria for water. t Vaporization Sub lim a t i o n 0 C A A1 A3 A26.11 1013 221 000 p (mb) 100 VAPORFusionLIQUID SOLID 374 T (°C) 82 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS water, aw, ice, ai, and water vapor, av, at the triple point are: aw =1.000 × 10−3 m3 kg−1 ai =1.091 × 10−3 m3 kg−1 av = 206 m3 kg−1. An interesting feature of Figure 6.1 is that the vaporization curve ends at point C where the temperature (TC)is374 ◦C and the pres- sure (pC) is approximately 2.21 × 10 5 mb. Beyond this critical point there is no line to separate liquid from vapor. Otherwise stated, beyond point C there is no discontinuity between the liquid and the gaseous phase. This indicates that beyond point C we cannot diﬀerentiate between the liquid and the vapor phase. In order to understand the signiﬁcance of critical point C let us consider point A representing the temperature and the pressure of a sample of water vapor below critical point C. If we decrease the volume while keeping the temperature constant the pressure increases until it becomes equal to the pressure at point A1 where it will condense. Similarly, if we keep the pressure constant and cool the gas until its temperature becomes equal to the temperature corresponding to point A2, the gas will condense. Obviously the gas will condense if we perform any intermediate process described by line AA3. Thus, there are three ways by which the gas can become liquid. We either have to cool it at constant pressure or compress it at constant temperature or simultaneously compress it and cool it. All three ways require crossing the equilibrium line. The fact that there is an end to the vaporization curve means that above TC we cannot liquefy a gas by compressing it at a constant temperature and that above pC we cannot liquefy a gas by cooling it at a constant pres- sure. Because in our atmosphere temperature and pressure are well below the critical point, water vapor can condense. For the other gases in the atmosphere (N2,O2, Ar) the critical temperatures are very low (−147 ◦C, −119 ◦C, −122 ◦C, respectively) and so they do not condense. Let us now consider phase changes along isotherms in the (p, V ) domain. Such a domain (shown in Figure 6.2) is called an Amagat– Andrews diagram. We start with a sample of water vapor at a state corresponding to point A in Figure 6.1 (i.e. at a temperature T1 and pressure p1 greater than the triple point temperature Tt and pres- sure pt. If we compress the vapor isothermally the pressure increases until we reach point A1. At this point liquid water and water vapor coexist in equilibrium. This means that some water vapor has con- densed to form liquid water and that liquid and vapor are in equilib- rium. Now what will happen if we further compress the vapor? Since we are on the equilibrium curve the pressure of the vapor depends 6.2 EQUILIBRIUM PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS – LATENT HEAT 83 Figure 6.2 An Amagat–Andrews diagram. V A C B A1 B1 Tt T1 T2 Tc Vc pt pc p (mb) Gas Vapor Triple pointWater Liquid Water and vapor Ice Ice and vapor only on temperature. As such, since the transformation is isother- mal, as long as liquid and vapor coexist a further decrease in volume cannot change the pressure. Do not get confused here. The ideal gas law does not apply to the mixture. Thus, if we keep on compress- ing the vapor we will observe that more vapor condenses to form liquid water (with liquid and vapor being always in equilibrium) until we reach point B where all vapor is condensed. This part will be represented in the (p, V ) diagram by the horizontal (constant p) stretch A1B. A further (small) compression causes the liquid water’s pressure to increase rapidly (owing to the low compress- ibility of liquids). This part is indicated by the segment BB1. The complete isotherm is depicted in Figure 6.2 by the line AA1BB1. For higher temperatures we observe that the horizontal stretch of the isotherms decreases until it reduces to a point. This is the point C corresponding to the critical state TC,pC,VC. The isotherms above the critical temperature are monotonic decreasing functions with no discontinuity. They go over into equilateral hyperbolas which is how ideal gases behave. For temperatures below T1 the horizontal stretch of the isotherms increases. A solid line in Fig- ure 6.2 connects the beginning and end points of the horizontal stretches. This line together with the critical isotherm and the isotherm corresponding to the triple point temperature (Tt) par- tition the diagram into six regions: vapor, gas, liquid water, ice, liquid water plus vapor, and ice plus vapor. Here the distinction between gas and vapor reﬂects only the fact that above TC no two-phase discontinuity for condensation exists. 6.2 Equilibrium phase transformations – latent heat In the case of a homogeneous system undergoing an isobaric transformation that does not result in a phase change the heat 84 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS exchanged is proportional to the temperature change (the proportionality constant is Cp). In the case of a heterogeneous sys- tem involving two phases we say that when the two phases are in equilibrium a ﬁxed temperature implies a ﬁxed pressure, meaning that isobaric transformations are also isothermal transformations. Thus, even though the masses of the two phases change, the tem- perature of the system does not (recall the horizontal stretches in Figure 6.2). In such cases, the amount of heat exchanged depends only on mass changes (which modify the internal energy of each sub- system) and on the work done owing to possible volume changes (the volume can change because the mixture does not obey the ideal gas law). By deﬁnition, the latent heat, L, of a transformation is the heat absorbed (or given away) by the system during an isobaric phase transition L = δQp = constant. Recall that enthalpy is deﬁned as H = U + pV . Diﬀerentiation of this equation gives dH = dU +pdV +Vdp. Since the change of phase takes place at a constant pressure it follows that dH = dU + pdV . The right-hand side of this equation is according to the ﬁrst law equal to δQ. It follows that L = dH. (6.2) Thus, the latent heat of a phase change is the change in enthalpy during the transformation. The latent heats of vaporization (liquid ↔ vapor), fusion (ice ↔ liquid), and sublimation (ice ↔ vapor) are denoted by Lv,Lf, and Ls, respectively. Note that the above latent heats are positive when during the transformation heat is absorbed (liquid → vapor, ice → liquid, ice → vapor) and negative when heat is released (vapor → liquid, liquid → ice, vapor → ice). Lv,Lf, and Ls are also called the enthalpy of vaporization, fusion, and sublimation, respectively. According to the above, Lv = Hv − Hw = Uv − Uw + pwv(Vv − Vw) Lf = Hw − Hi = Uw − Ui + pwi(Vw − Vi) (6.3) Ls = Hv − Hi = Uv − Ui + pvi(Vv − Vi) where here p stands for the equilibrium pressure between two phases. At the triple point pwv = pvi = pwi =6.11 mb. It follows that at the triple point the speciﬁc latent heats lv,lf, and ls satisfy the relationship ls = lf + lv. Obviously, the latent heats depend on temperature (see Table A.3). Nevertheless, in the range of temper- atures observed in the troposphere they do not vary signiﬁcantly. Because of that it is often assumed that the latent heats are inde- pendent of temperature. It is easy to show that the ﬁrst law in the case of an isobaric change of phase can be written as dU = L − pdV . For fusion dV ≈ 0 and for vaporization and sublimation 6.3 THE CLAUSIUS–CLAPEYRON (C–C) EQUATION 85 dV = Vvapor−Vliquid water or ice ≈ Vvapor. Thus, the ﬁrst law reduces to dU = L for fusion dU = L − mRvT for vaporization or sublimation (6.4) where Rv is the gas constant for water vapor. 6.3 The Clausius–Clapeyron (C–C) equation Before we proceed and to avoid confusion with too many subscripts we need to make a change in our notation. From now on we shall represent the water vapor pressure as e. Furthermore, during phase transitions the equilibrium (saturation) vapor pressure over water will be denoted as esw and equilibrium vapor pressure over ice will be denoted as esi. For an ideal gas we saw how the equation of state p = f (V, T ) relates changes of pressure, temperature, and volume. In the case of a heterogeneous system involving two phases we saw that p = es = f (T ). Does this indicate that a relationship similar to the equation of state for ideal gases exists for heterogeneous systems? Let us consider the transformation described by isothermal T1 in Figure 6.2 and focus our attention on segment A1B. Going from A1 to B a change of phase takes place (vapor → liquid). As we discussed before, between A1 and B vapor is in equilibrium with liquid water and p = esw = f (T ). Because of that any other state variable or function is a function of temperature only. Let us assume that at point C (Figure 6.3) the mass of the liquid phase is mw and the mass of the vapor phase is mv. Then the total volume and internal energy of the system at point C are V = mwaw + mvav U = mwuw + mvuv Figure 6.3 The isotherm T1 of Figure 6.2. For any given change C −→ C ′ the change in volume is dV . This causes an amount dm of liquid water to evaporate. V T1 A1B p (mb) CC ' dV 86 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS where aw,av,uw,uv are the speciﬁc volumes and internal energies of the two phases. Now assume that the system moves from C to C ′. This change corresponds to a change in volume dV and causes an amount dm of liquid to evaporate. The volume at point C ′ will be V + dV =(mw − dm)aw +(mv + dm)av or using the previous equation dV =(av − aw)dm. (6.5) Similarly dU =(uv − uw)dm. (6.6) Recall from equation (6.3) that during this change uv − uw + esw(av − aw)= lv. (6.7) Dividing equation (6.6) by (6.5) yields dU dV = uv − uw av − aw or using equation (6.7) dU dV = lv av − aw − esw. (6.8) Here is as good a place as any to restate that while general deﬁni- tions such as the ﬁrst law (equation (4.5)), the second law (equation (5.12)), enthalpy (H = U +pV ), speciﬁc heat (equation (4.14)), etc. are valid for any system, variations or expressions derived using the ideal gas law (for example, equations (4.22) and (4.18)) are not valid for any system but ideal gases. According to problem 6.1, for any system ( ∂U ∂V ) T = T ( ∂p ∂T ) V − p. (6.9) Also, according to problem 6.2, for an ideal gas (∂U/∂V )T =0 (Joule’s law). However, water in equilibrium with its vapor is not an ideal gas and U and esw are functions of temperature only. Then since the transformation is isothermal we can write that ( ∂U ∂V ) T = dU dV and ( ∂esw ∂T ) V = desw dT . Accordingly, equation (6.9) becomes dU dV = T desw dT − esw. 6.4 CONSEQUENCES OF THE C–C EQUATION 87 Combining this equation with equation (6.8) yields T desw dT − esw = lv av − aw − esw or desw dT = lv T (av − aw) . (6.10) Equation (6.10) is called the Clausius–Clapeyron (C–C) equation. In its general form, des dT = l T Δa , (6.11) it relates the equilibrium pressure between two phases to the tem- perature of the heterogeneous system. Here l is the speciﬁc latent heat (or speciﬁc enthalpy) of the change of phase and Δa is the diﬀerence in the speciﬁc volumes between the two phases at tem- perature T . It is for heterogeneous systems what the equation of state is for ideal gases. 6.4 Approximations and consequences of the C–C equation • Temperature dependence of enthalpy of vaporization By diﬀerentiating equation (6.3) we have ∂Lv ∂T = ∂Hv ∂T − ∂Hw ∂T = Cpv − Cpw where Cpv and Cpw are the heat capacities at constant pressure for vapor and liquid water, respectively. Since Lv is the enthalpy diﬀerence between the vapor and liquid water phases at equilibrium, it depends only on temperature. As such the above equation can be written as dLv dT = Cpv − Cpw. (6.12) For a wide range of temperatures (−20 ◦Cto30 ◦C), Cpv and Cpw vary very little (about 1%). Because of that we can consider them independent of temperature and integrate equation (6.12) to get Lv = Lv0 +(Cpv − Cpw)(T − T0) or lv = lv0 +(cpv − cpw)(T − T0) (6.13) where lv0 is the speciﬁc latent heat of vaporization at the ref- erence state T0. For the reference state T0 = 273 K with lv0 = 2.5 × 10 6 Jkg−1,cpv = 1850 J kg−1 K −1, and cpw = 4218 J kg−1 K −1, 88 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS equation (6.13) provides a very good approximation of lv over the range from −20 ◦Cto30 ◦C. We can repeat the above for sublimation and fusion to arrive at dLs dT = Cpv − Cpi dLf dT = Cpw − Cpi or ls = ls0 +(cpv − cpi)(T − T0) (6.14) lf = lf0 +(cpw − cpi)(T − T0). Recall that the speciﬁc heat for constant volume is cV = δq/dT . Since water vapor is considered an ideal gas (recall Joule’s law), it follows that cV v = δq dT = duv dT . For liquid water (not an ideal gas) cV w = δq dT = duw dT + p daw dT . Since aw varies very little with T the above equation reduces to cV w = duw dT . Similarly, for ice cV i = dui/dT . Now since h = u + pa it follows that for water vapor cpv = dhv/dT = duv/dT + Rv. Therefore for water vapor cpv ̸= cV v. Liquid water and ice do not behave as ideal gases. Therefore pa ̸= RT . In this case cpw = dhw dT = duw dT + p daw dT + aw dp dT ≈ duw dT (because dp = 0 and daw/dT ≈ 0). Thus, cpw ≈ cV w = cw. Similarly cpi ≈ cV i = ci. Using the values of cpv,cV v,cw, and ci at T = 0 ◦C (1850, 1390, 4218, and 2106 J kg−1 K −1, respectively) and using equations (6.13) and (6.14) we ﬁnd that dlv dT ≈−2368 J kg−1 K −1 dls dT ≈−256Jkg−1 K −1 dlf dT ≈ 2112 J kg−1 K −1. These rates are small compared with the values of lv,ls, and lf at 0 ◦C(2.5×106, 2.834×106, and 0.334×106Jkg−1 K −1, respectively). 6.4 CONSEQUENCES OF THE C–C EQUATION 89 We can thus conclude that all latent heats vary very little with temperature. As such the above equations justify approximating lv,ls, and lf as constants. An improvement to this approximation is given by equations (6.13) and (6.14) which express them as linear functions of T . • Temperature dependence of equilibrium (saturation) vapor pressure In the case of vaporization, av ≫ aw and C–C equation can be approximated as desw dT = lv Tav . (6.15) By combining equations (6.15) and (6.13) and considering vapor as an ideal gas (i.e. eswav = RvT ) we obtain 1 esw desw dT = lv0 +(cpw − cpv)T0 RvT 2 − cpw − cpv RvT or ∫ esw at T esw at T0 desw esw = lv0 +(cpw − cpv)T0 Rv ∫ T T0 dT T 2 − cpw − cpv Rv ∫ T T0 dT T or ln esw es0 = lv0 +(cpw − cpv)T0 Rv ( 1 T0 − 1 T ) − cpw − cpv Rv ln T T0 . Considering as the reference state the triple point where T0 = 0 ◦C,es0 =6.11 mb,lv0 =2.5 × 106Jkg−1,cpv = 1850 J kg−1 K −1, and cpw = 4218 J kg−1 K −1 the above equation reduces to ln esw es0 = 6808 ( 1 T0 − 1 T ) − 5.09 ln T T0 or esw =6.11 exp (53.49 − 6808 T − 5.09 lnT ) . (6.16) The above equation provides the relation between esw and T . Another way to establish such a relation would be to integrate equa- tion (6.15) assuming that lv is constant and independent of T . This would result in an approximation to the above equation given by ln esw es0 = lv RvT0 − lv RvT . or esw =6.11 exp (19.83 − 5417 T ) . (6.17) In both equations (6.16) and (6.17) esw is in mb and T is in Kelvin. In problem 6.3 you are asked to show that equations (6.16) and 90 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS (6.17) are nearly identical for temperatures in the range −20 ◦Cto 30 ◦C. The corresponding relation to equations (6.16) and (6.17) for subli- mation can be derived following the same procedure (here again av ≫ ai) with ls =2.834 × 106Jkg−1 and ci = 2106 J kg−1 K −1. They are: esi =6.11 exp (26.16 − 6293 T − 0.555 ln T ) (6.18) and esi =6.11 exp (22.49 − 6142 T ) . (6.19) The C–C equation and its simpliﬁed versions describe the thermo- dynamic state of water vapor and liquid water (or water vapor and ice) when the two phases are in equilibrium. When the system’s pressure is greater than the equilibrium pressure, equilibrium is approached by condensation (sublimation) of water vapor. This reduces the amount of vapor in the system thereby reducing the vapor pressure. If the system’s pressure is lower than the equilib- rium pressure, equilibrium is approached by water (ice) evaporating (sublimating). Because of the particular exponential dependence of esw and esi on T in equations (6.17) and (6.19) it follows that for higher temperatures esw is greater than for lower temperatures. As such more water vapor can exist at higher temperatures. For exam- ple, for T = 300 K from equation (6.17) we have esw = 36 mb. For T = 273 ◦C,esw = 6 mb. This is a substantial diﬀerence. Note that this does necessarily imply that warmer air can hold more water vapor than colder air as it is often wrongly stated. All the above arguments and formulas were derived in the absence of air! We only considered two phases with water evaporating (or vapor condens- ing) into a vacuum. If you think about it this is consistent with Dalton’s law which would indicate that in a mixture of air and water vapor the partial pressures are independent of the mixture. Therefore, keep in mind that when we say that “air at a given tem- perature is saturated” we do not imply that the air holds as much vapor as it can hold. We strictly mean that at that temperature the amount of vapor that can exist is maximum regardless of the presence of air. The reason for the relation between equilibrium vapor pressure and temperature arises from purely kinetic reasons. At equilibrium evaporation is zero (strictly speaking it is the net evaporation = evaporation minus condensation that is zero as molecules inside water have as much chance to evaporate as vapor molecules have to condense). At higher temperatures the molecules inside the liq- uid acquire greater speeds and their chance to escape increases. As a result (net) evaporation increases. 6.4 CONSEQUENCES OF THE C–C EQUATION 91 The exponential dependence of esw (or esi)on T has important con- sequences for our climate system. Tropical warm water can transfer more water vapor into the atmosphere than colder extratropical water. Most of this water vapor is then precipitated as a result of organized convection in the tropics thereby releasing large amounts of heat. This heat can then be converted to work and generate kinetic energy which helps maintain the general circulation against frictional dissipation. • Changes in the melting and boiling points for water At boiling point (T = 100 ◦C),lv =2.26 × 10 6Jkg−1,av = 1.673 m3 kg−1, and aw =0.00104 m3 kg−1. Then from equation (6.15) it follows that desw dT = 3621 Pa K −1 or desw dT =0.03575 atm K −1. Accordingly, a decrease in pressure by 0.03575 atm (36.2 mb) lowers the boiling point by 1 ◦C. Note that if we evaluate the approximate relationship (6.16) at T1 = 373 K and T2 = 372 K, we will ﬁnd that esw(T1) ≈ 1003 mb and esw(T2) ≈ 969 mb,orΔesw ≈−34 mb. If we use instead equation (6.17), we will ﬁnd that esw(T1) ≈ 1237 mb,esw(T2) ≈ 1190 mb, and Δesw ≈−47 mb. The diﬀerences are due to the fact that in deriving the approximate expressions we have assumed that the speciﬁc heats and latent heats are either constant or linear functions of T . While in the range of temper- ature relevant to weather these approximations may be good, for temperatures outside this range the diﬀerences may be signiﬁcant. At melting point (T =0 ◦C),lf =0.334 × 106 Jkg−1,aw = 1.00013 × 10 −3 m3 kg−1, and ai =1.0907 × 10−3 m3 kg−1. Substi- tuting these values into equation (6.15) yields dpwi dT = −13 503 800 Pa K −1 or dpwi dT = −133.3 atm K −1. This result indicates that lowering the melting point by just 1 ◦C will require a tremendous increase in pressure. This is actually rather anomalous as in most cases the melting point increases with increas- ing pressure. The strange behavior of water and ice is due to the fact that ice is less dense than water whereas in most cases the solid is denser than the liquid. The fact that the melting point of ice is lowered by increasing pressure is very important to geophysics as it explains the motion of glaciers. When a mass of ice encounters 92 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS a rock on the glacier bed the high pressure of the ice against the rock lowers the melting point of ice causing the ice to melt and then to ﬂow around the rock. Once behind the rock the pressure is restored and ice freezes again. In this way ice propagates around obstacles. Examples (6.1) Calculate the work done, the amount of heat absorbed, and the change in the internal energy during (a) melting of 1 g of ice to water at a temperature of 0 oC and under a constant pressure of 1 atmosphere, and (b) evaporation of 1 g of water to water vapor at a temperature of 100 oC and under a constant pressure of 1 atmosphere. (a) When the eﬀect of absorbing an amount Q at a con- stant pressure is a change in the physical state of the system (which also occurs at constant temperature), then Q is pro- portional to the mass that undergoes the change. In our case Q = mlf where lf is the speciﬁc latent heat of fusion of 0 ◦C. For ice lf =79.7 cal g−1. Thus, Q = lfm =79.7 cal. During melting the volume changes. The corresponding work done is W = ∫ water ice pdV = p ∫ water ice dV = p(Vwater − Vice). The density of ice at 0 ◦Cis0.917 g cm−3, so 1 g occupies a volume of 1.09 cm3. The density of water at 0 ◦Cis1 g cm−3. Accordingly, 1 g of water occupies a volume of 1.0cm3.It follows that W = 1013 × 102 × (1 − 1.09) × 10−6 J or W = −0.00912 J or W = −0.0022 cal. The work done is negative because the volume of the result- ing water is smaller than the volume of ice. From the above we then ﬁnd that ΔU = Q − W =79.7022 cal. EXAMPLES 93 (b) In this case at 100 ◦C,lv = 539 cal g−1. Thus, Q = lvm = 539 cal. Water at 100 ◦C has a density of 0.958 g cm−3 which for 1 g gives a volume of 1.04 cm3. The volume of 1 g of water vapor at 100 ◦C is 1673 cm3. As such W = p(Vvapor − Vwater) = 1013 × 102 × (1673 − 1.04) × 10−6 = 169.37J=40.47 cal. It then follows that ΔU = 498.53 cal. Note that in both cases the internal energy increases even though the temperature remains constant. This is due to the fact that the degrees of freedom increase. The degrees of freedom of the molecules in H2O is much greater in the liquid phase than in the ice phase and much greater in water vapor than liquid water. (6.2) Can raindrops grow from cloud droplets through condensation alone? In order to address this question we have to make some rea- sonable assumptions. Cloud droplets form over nuclei and begin to grow according to the available water vapor. If the vapor pressure is greater than the equilibrium vapor pres- sure droplets grow by condensation. So we need to get an idea of how much vapor is available and how many droplets are going to compete for this vapor. Let us assume that the concentration of nuclei is 100 cm −3 which corresponds to rather clean air. Now we need to estimate the amount of vapor that will be available during the process of grow- ing by condensation. We can get a gross estimate of this amount by assuming that at the level where clouds form (say 1000 m) the air is saturated and the surface temperature is about 30 ◦C. If this air ascends adiabatically, the tempera- ture decreases. As the temperature decreases the equilibrium (saturation) vapor pressure decreases. This means that not as much vapor is needed for equilibrium or that the vapor pressure becomes greater than the equilibrium vapor pres- sure. Thus, the droplets begin to grow. If the air ascends to the maximum level (say the top of the troposphere at about 16 km), then we can estimate the equilibrium vapor pressure at that level by assuming that no water vapor condenses 94 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS using the equation ln esw 6.11 =19.83 − 5417 T , where T =30 − (16 × 9.8) = −126.8 ◦C = 146.2 K. It follows that at this level esw = 0. At cloud base where the temper- ature is ≈ 20.2 ◦C,esw ≈ 23.7 mb. As such in this scenario the equivalent of 23.7 mb in water vapor will be available to the droplets for growth. How much water vapor is that? From the ideal gas law we ﬁnd that for V =1 m3 mv = eswV RvT =0.0175 kg. Assuming that a typical raindrop has a radius of 0.5mm it follows that the mass of a raindrop is mraindrop = V/ρ ≈ 0.00052 g. Given the total amount of water vapor available this translates to ∼ 33 650 raindrops. However, in 1 m 3 of air there are 108 “competitors” with equal rights. Simply, none of them will grow to be a raindrop by condensation only. Other processes must also take place (collision, coalescence, for example). (6.3) Consider a sample of 2 moles of supercooled water (i.e. liquid water existing at environmental temperatures less than 0 oC). Assume that the temperature of the surroundings is −10 oC and that the supercooled water freezes. In this process the latent heat of fusion (freezing) is lost to the surroundings and finally ice and surroundings return to the original temperature. Calculate ΔU, ΔH, and ΔS for both supercooled water and surroundings. Two moles of water equal 36 g. If we neglect volume and pressure variations during phase changes between water and ice it follows from the ﬁrst law and the deﬁnition of enthalpy that for both supercooled water and surroundings ΔH =ΔU = Q. There is a correct and a wrong way to calculate Q and ΔS during this process. If we calculate the amount of heat given away from the supercooled water as it freezes at −10 ◦C, we ﬁnd that Qw = −mlf(−10 ◦C) = −0.036 × 0.312 × 10 6 J= −11 232 J. Then, if we use equation (5.7) we will ﬁnd that ΔSw = ∫ δQ/T = −42.7JK −1. The amount of heat released is gained by the surroundings. Thus, QS = 11 232 and ΔSS = 42.7JK −1. It follows that the change in entropy of the whole system (surroundings + supercooled water) is zero. But there EXAMPLES 95 was a change in the system, which, according to the sec- ond law, should increase the entropy of the system. The reason for this violation is that we have indirectly assumed that the spontaneous freezing is a reversible process, which is not. A correct way would be the following: Start with the super- cooled water at −10 ◦C and warm it reversibly to 0 ◦C (step 1), freeze it reversibly at 0 ◦C (step 2) and then cool it reversibly to −10 ◦C (step 3). In this scenario we have Step 1 Q1 = mcpwΔT = 1518.5J ΔS1 = ∫ T2 T1 mcpw dT T =5.67JK −1 Step 2 Q2 = −mlf(0 ◦C) = −12 013.2J ΔS2 = Q2 T2 = −44.0JK −1 Step 3 Q3 = mcpiΔT = −758.2J ΔS3 = ∫ T1 T2 mcpi dT T = −2.83JK −1 In the above calculations we have considered that T1 = 263 K,T2 = 273 K,cpw = cw = 4218 J kg−1 K −1,cpi = ci = 2106 J kg−1 K −1, and lf(0 ◦C)=0.3337 × 10 6 Jkg−1 K −1. It follows that the amount of heat released by the supercooled water is Qw = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = −11 252.9J, and the change in entropy of the supercooled water is ΔSw =ΔS1 +ΔS2 +ΔS3 = −41.16JK −1. The surroundings (TS = −10 ◦C) gain the amount that the freezing of supercooled water releases. Thus, ΔUS =ΔHS = QS = −Qw = 11 252.9J. At the same time their change of entropy is ΔSS = ∫ δQS TS = QS TS =42.79JK −1. 96 6 WATER AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS It follows that the change in the entropy of the whole system (surroundings + supercooled water) is ΔS =ΔSS +ΔSw =1.63JK −1 > 0. Problems (6.1) Prove that for any system ( ∂U ∂V ) T = T ( ∂p ∂T ) V − p. (Hint: express dU using equation (2.1) and substitute into the ﬁrst law. Then consider the deﬁnition of dS = δQ/T and the fact that dS is an exact diﬀerential, perform the partial diﬀerentiations and collect terms.) (6.2) Using the equation derived in problem 6.1, show that for an ideal gas U is only a function of temperature and does not depend on V (Joule’s law). (6.3) By plotting esw against T show that in the range −20 ◦Cto 30 ◦C equations (6.16) and (6.17) are virtually identical. If we were very picky about choosing one over the other which would you choose? (6.4) Inside an open container is 500 g of ice with temperature T = −20 ◦C. Heat is then provided to the ice at a rate of 100 cal min −1 for 700 min. Plot (a) the relationship between temperature (in ◦C) and time (in seconds), (b) the relation- ship between the heat absorbed by the ice and time, (c) the relationship between the heat absorbed and tempera- ture. Neglect the heat capacity of the container and assume that lf = constant = 79.7 cal g−1 and ci = constant = 0.503 cal g−1 K −1. (6.5) A closed box of volume 2 m 3 and temperature 120 ◦C con- tains 1 m 3 of water saturated with vapor. Calculate (a) the mass of water vapor, (b) the mass of water vapor that must slowly escape in order for the temperature inside the box to decrease to 100 ◦C while maintaining saturated conditions. (1.43 kg, 0.71 kg) (6.6) An open container of volume 2 liters contains dry air and some quantity of water at standard conditions. After equi- librium is achieved the container is closed and heated to a temperature of 100 ◦C. What is the least amount of water that must have been added if after the heating the air is saturated? What is the ﬁnal pressure inside the box? Use equation (6.16). (1.16 g, 2.35 atmospheres) (6.7) A substance obeys the equation of state pV 1.2 =10 9T 1.1. A measurement of its internal capacity inside a container PROBLEMS 97 Figure 6.4 Illustration for problem 6.10. Ice 10 kg having a constant volume of 100 liters shows that under these conditions the thermal capacity is constant and equal to 0.1 cal K −1. Express the energy and the entropy of the system as function of T and V . (Hint: Is the substance an ideal gas?) (6.8) How would you have to alter your assumptions in example 6.2 in order to make cloud droplets grow to raindrops by condensation only? (6.9) Calculate the change in entropy when 5 kg of water at 10 ◦C is raised to 100 ◦C and then converted into steam at that temperature. At 100 ◦C the latent heat of vaporization of water is 2.253 × 106 Jkg−1. In the above range of tempera- tures, the speciﬁc heat capacity under constant volume for water is nearly independent of temperature with a value of about 4.18 × 10 3 Jkg−1 K −1.(≥ 35 972 J K −1) (6.10) A block of ice rests as shown in Figure 6.4. A wire on which we attach a weight surrounds the ice. Explain why the wire will go through the ice block without the ice breaking into two pieces. (6.11) The warm source of a Carnot cycle has a temperature of 100 ◦C while the cold source consists of melting ice. When the cycle operates for 1 h it is observed that 1 ton of ice has melted. Calculate (1) the heat absorbed in the cycle from the warm source (2) the heat given away in the cycle to the cold source. The latent heat of fusion at 100 ◦Cis 0.3337 × 106 Jkg−1. (333.7 × 106 J, 244.2 × 106 J) CHAPTER SEVEN Moist air Our atmosphere is basically a two-component system. One compo- nent is dry air and the other is water existing in vapor and possibly one of the condensed phases (liquid water or ice). According to Dal- ton’s law, in a mixture of ideal gases each gas can be assumed to behave as if the other gases were absent. As such, in a mixture of dry air, water vapor, and a condensed phase, the “water” system (water vapor + condensed phase) can be treated as being independent of the dry air. In this case, the concepts developed in the previ- ous chapter (for the one-component heterogeneous system “water”) are valid for the two-component heterogeneous system “dry air + water”. We will call the system consisting of dry air and water vapor “moist air” and it can be unsaturated or saturated with water vapor. Since liquid water is absent, moist air is a two-component system with one phase present. As such, according to equation (6.1) we need three state variables to specify the system’s state. Usually these variables are taken to be pressure, temperature, and a new variable (to be deﬁned soon) called mixing ratio. If the condensed phase is present and in equilibrium with the vapor phase, then two variables are needed (typically temperature and pressure). For clarity in our notation we will use the subscripts d, w, v to indi- cate dry air, liquid water, and water vapor, respectively. The only exception will be for the vapor pressure, which we will denote sim- ply as e. Variables with no subscripts will correspond to a mixture of dry air and water vapor. The following table gives various systems, their type, and the variables needed to specify their state (see equation 6.1). 99 100 7 MOIST AIR System Type Variables needed to specify system’s state Dry air and Heterogeneous – 3 (p, T mixing ratio) water vapor two components, one phase Dry air, water vapor, Heterogeneous – and liquid water two components, two phases 2 (p, T ) Dry air, water vapor, Heterogeneous – liquid water, and ice two components, three phases 1 (T ) Liquid water and Heterogeneous – water vapor one component, two phases 1 (T ) Liquid water, water Heterogeneous – vapor, and ice one component, three phases 0 Water vapor Homogeneous – one component, one phase 2 (p, T ) Dry air Homogeneous – one component, one phase 2 (p, T ) 7.1 Measures and description of moist air 7.1.1 Humidity variables In a sample of moist air, dry air and water vapor have the same temperature T and occupy the same volume V . Thus, for water vapor eV = mvRvT or e = ρvRvT where e is the vapor pressure, ρv is the density of water vapor, and Rv is the speciﬁc gas constant for water vapor. Since the molecu- lar weight of water Mv =18.01 g mol−1, the value of Rv is equal to R∗/Mv = 461.5Jkg−1 K −1. Since R∗ = RdMd it follows that RdMd = RvMv. Thus, 7.1 MEASURES AND DESCRIPTION OF MOIST AIR 101 ϵ = Rd Rv = Mv Md =0.622. (7.1) We deﬁne the speciﬁc humidity, q, and mixing ratio, w,as q = ρv ρ = mv m and w = ρv ρd = mv md (7.2) where m = md+mv is the total mass of the mixture (ρv is also called the absolute humidity). Since ρv = eMv/R∗T, ρd = pdMd/R∗T , and pd = p − e it follows that w = ϵ e p − e . (7.3) At saturation the saturation mixing ratio is ws = ϵ es p − es (7.4) where es is either the equilibrium (saturation) vapor pressure with respect to liquid water (esw) or with respect to ice (esi). In general es,e ≪ p which reduces the above two equations to w ≈ ϵ e p ,ws ≈ ϵ es p . (7.5) Since 1/q =(md + mv)/mv =(md/mv) + 1 it follows that 1 q = 1 w +1 or w = q 1 − q , q = w 1+ w . (7.6) In the atmosphere both w and q are very small (w, q ≪ 1). For this reason we can always assume that w ≈ q. The relative humidity, r, is deﬁned as r = mv mvs where mv is the mass of water vapor in a sample of moist air of volume V and mvs is the mass of water vapor the sample would have had if it were saturated. Because of the ideal gas law we can write r as r = e es . (7.7) Using (7.5) it follows that approximately r ≈ w ws . 102 7 MOIST AIR 7.1.2 Mean molecular weight of moist air and other quantities According to equation (3.13) we have that the mean molecular weight of moist air is M = md + mv md Md + mv Mv . We can manipulate the above equation by writing it as 1 M = ( md Md + mv Mv )( 1 md + mv ) or 1 M = 1 Md [ 1 md + mv (md + mvMd Mv )] or 1 M = 1 Md md md + mv (1+ mv/md Mv/Md ) or 1 M = 1 Md 1 1+ w (1+ w ϵ ) or 1 M = 1 Md ( 1 1+ w + q ϵ ) . Since 1 1+ w = q w and w = q 1 − q , then 1 M = 1 Md (1 − q + q ϵ ) or 1 M = 1 Md [ 1+ ( 1 ϵ − 1) q] or 1 M = 1 Md (1+0.61q) . Then for moist air the equation of state is pa = RmoistT = R∗ M T = R∗ Md (1+0.61q)T, = Rd(1+0.61q)T. (7.8) The above equation deﬁnes the virtual temperature, Tvirt = (1+0.61q)T, (7.9) 7.1 MEASURES AND DESCRIPTION OF MOIST AIR 103 which can be interpreted as the temperature of dry air having the same values of p and a as the moist air. Otherwise stated, virtual temperature is the temperature that air of a given pressure and volume (or density) would have if the air were completely free of water vapor. Since q in reality is always greater than zero, Tvirt is always greater than T . The above equation also gives the gas constant of the mixture: R = (1+0.61q)Rd. (7.10) Similarly, we can deﬁne the speciﬁc heat capacities of moist air. Suppose that a sample of such air receives, at a constant pressure, an amount of heat δQ which increases its temperature by dT . Some of this amount (δQd) is absorbed by the dry air and some (δQv)by the water vapor. In this case we can write that δQ = δQd + δQv or δQ = mdδqd + mvδqv or δq = md md + mv δqd + mv md + mv δqv or δq =(1 − q)δqd + qδqv. Recalling the deﬁnition of speciﬁc heat capacities we then have cp =(1 − q) δqd dT + q δqv dT or cp =(1 − q)cpd + q cpv or cp = cpd [ 1+ ( cpv cpd − 1) q] or cp = cpd(1+0.87q) ≈ cpd(1+0.87w). (7.11) Similarly cV =(1 − q)cV d + qcV v which leads to cV = cV d(1+0.97q) ≈ cV d(1+0.97w). (7.12) From equations (7.11) and (7.12) we also have γ = cp cV = cpd cV d (1+0.87q) (1+0.97q) , 104 7 MOIST AIR which because q ≪ 1 can be approximated with γ ≈ γd(1+0.87q)(1 − 0.97q) or after ignoring the second-order term γ ≈ γd(1 − 0.1q), (7.13) where γd =1.4. Similarly, k = γ − 1 γ = R cp = Rd cpd (1+0.61q) (1+0.87q) ≈ kd(1+0.61q)(1 − 0.87q) ≈ kd(1 − 0.26q), (7.14) where kd =0.286. Note that similar expressions in the presence of liquid water cannot be derived because liquid water + vapor does not constitute an ideal gas. 7.2 Processes in the atmosphere In this section we will discuss scenarios that are relevant to basic processes in the atmosphere. To make the discussion ﬂow eﬀec- tively we will start with processes happening at a constant pressure level (for example, at the surface). After that we will proceed with processes involving ascent, ﬁrst of unsaturated air and then of sat- urated air. Finally, we will discuss processes that involve mixing of two air masses in the horizontal and in the vertical. The laws and formulas describing each process will be derived analytically. Subse- quently, each process will be described visually in a (p, T ) diagram. As we will see later, better diagrams can be designed. However, for now the simple and familiar (p, T ) diagram will be used for illus- trating the various processes. In the following presentation when a condensed phase is present, we will assume that it is liquid water. The same theory holds when the condensed phase is ice as long as the appropriate substitutions are made (for example esi for esw, ls for lv, ci for cw, etc.). 7.2.1 Isobaric cooling – dew and frost temperatures Consider a parcel of unsaturated moist air and assume it is a closed system. In this case q and w remain constant. If this parcel begins to cool at a constant pressure the vapor pressure e will also remain constant as long as condensation does not occur (recall that e = wp/(w + ϵ). However, the equilibrium vapor pressure will not remain constant. As we saw in the last chapter both esw and esi are 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 105 strongly dependent on T , and as T decreases so does es. Since es decreases it follows that the relative humidity increases and satura- tion is approached. The temperature at which saturation is reached is called the dew point temperature, Tdew, if saturation is reached with respect to liquid water or the frost point temperature, Tf,if saturation is reached with respect to ice. These temperatures derive their name from the fact that if the par- cel cools isobarically below these temperatures droplets (or ice) will form. However, keep in mind that for condensation (or sublima- tion) to happen at temperatures just below saturation point either condensation nuclei or solid surfaces must be present. Spontaneous condensation in the absence of nuclei or surfaces needs extremely high relative humidities – supersaturation – which cannot easily occur in the atmosphere. Isobaric cooling can happen naturally because of radiation cooling of the surface or the air itself. In this case the ground can lose enough heat to cool below the temperature at which atmospheric water vapor condenses. If this happens at temperatures greater than 0 ◦C water vapor in the layer very close to the surface condenses on the surface and becomes visible as dew. If it happens at tem- peratures less than 0 ◦C the product is frost. If the cooling is very strong or if the air itself cools by radiation, the layers of air above the surface may also cool below their saturation point leading to the formation of radiation fog. Alternatively, isobaric cooling can be achieved when air moves in the horizontal (p ≈ constant) and trav- els over colder regions. Then saturation may occur as the air cools by heat conduction to the surface. This leads to advection fogs. At Tdew vapor pressure becomes the equilibrium (saturation) vapor pressure (and to a very good approximation the mixing ratio becomes the saturation mixing ratio). As such if e is the partial vapor pressure at T , the dew point must satisfy the equation esw(Tdew)= e. (7.15) This is shown graphically in Figure 7.1 where point B is assumed to have a temperature T and vapor pressure e. To approach saturation isobarically we must draw a line from B perpendicu- lar to the pressure axis. Point C corresponds to a temperature where the water vapor pressure is its equilibrium vapor pressure. This point thus deﬁnes Tdew. In this diagram AT = esw(T ) and BT = CTdew = e = esw(Tdew). Obviously, since the equilibrium vapor pressure curve is known the relative humidity and dew point temperature of any point in the diagram can easily be found (r = T B/T A, Tdew = OT − BC). If only the temperature is known then we need to know Tdew in order to estimate the rela- tive humidity and the absolute humidity. From the ﬁgure it follows that neither relative humidity nor the dew point spread (or dew 106 7 MOIST AIR Figure 7.1 Graphical definition of the dew point temperature, Tdew. Clearly, esw(Tdew)= e(T ). T B A C 0 e T (°C)Tdew point depression), T − Tdew, are direct measures of the actual water vapor amount. Both describe how far we are from the equilibrium curve but similar values for r or T − Tdew correspond to diﬀerent e and thus to diﬀerent ρv(absolute humidity). Note that, depending on where a given point in the (e, T ) diagram is, Tdew (or Tf)may or may not be deﬁned. For example, in Figure 7.2, given point P only Tdew can be deﬁned. For point P ′,T ′ dew = T ′ f = triple point tem- perature. For point P ′′ and in the presence of supercooled water, both T ′′ f and T ′′ dew can be deﬁned with T ′′ f >T ′′ dew. If supercooled water is not present, T ′′ dew cannot be deﬁned. It can be shown that the dew point temperature of a rising parcel decreases. If we denote as Tdew,0 and Tdew,z the dew point temper- atures at the surface and at some higher level z, respectively, we have that esw(Tdew,0)= e0 = RvρvT0 esw(Tdew,z)= ez = RvρvTz. As a parcel rises and expands, both its temperature and vapor density decrease (because the vapor is distributed over a larger Figure 7.2 Depending on where a given state is in a (p, T ) diagram, Tdew or Tf may or may not be defined. For example, for state P only Tdew can be defined. S u b l imation V a p o rization T P p (mb) P' P\" Tdew T'dew = Tf' Tf\"T\"dew 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 107 volume). Thus e0 >ez and esw(Tdew,0) >esw(Tdew,z). Then from equation (6.17), it follows that Tdew,z <Tdew,0. Estimating T dew Since e = esw(Tdew) the C–C equation can be written as de dTdew = lve RvT 2 dew or desw esw = lvdT RvT 2 . Considering lv ≈ constant and integrating from Tdew (where esw(Tdew)= e)to T (where esw(T )= esw) we obtain ln esw e = lv Rv ( T − Tdew TTdew ) or − ln r = lv Rv ( T − Tdew TTdew ) or T − Tdew = −RvTTdew ln r/lv. (7.16) Equation (7.16) provides Tdew from temperature and relative humidity. Using lv ≈ 2.501×106 Jkg−1 and Rv = 461.51Jkg−1 K −1, the above equation becomes T − Tdew = −1.845 × 10−4TTdew ln r. Following the same procedure we can obtain (for ls =2.8345 J kg−1) T − Tf = −1.628 × 10−4TTf ln r. Estimating the dew point temperature can be visualized in the fol- lowing (p, T ) diagram (Figure 7.3) where pressure decreases along the y-axis. In this diagram a couple of dry adiabatic (solid) and a couple of saturation mixing ratio (broken) lines are shown. The dry adiabats can be calculated from Poisson’s equation ln θ =ln T + kd ln 1000 − kd ln p by setting ln θ = constant: ln p = 1 kd ln T + constant. 108 7 MOIST AIR Figure 7.3 Illustration of the estimation procedure of the dew point temperature. Tdew 1000 p 10 g kg–1 15 g kg–1 p (mb) T (p, T ) θ2 θ2 θ1 θ1 > θ2 Ina(p, T ) coordinate system, this is not a straight line. The sat- uration mixing ratio lines can be calculated from equations (7.5) and (6.17) p ≈ ϵesw(T ) wsw or p ≈ 6.11ϵ wsw exp (19.83 − 5417 T ) or ln p ≈ ln 6.11ϵ wsw +19.83 − 5417 T or for some wsw = constant ln p ≈ A + B T where A =ln 6.11ϵ/wsw +19.83 and B = −5417. In a (p, T ) dia- gram this is not a straight line either. For this reason both the dry adiabats and the saturation mixing ratio lines are depicted as nonlinear curves. Since the purpose here is to illustrate the process graphically, these curves are realistic but by no means exact. Let us now assume that an air parcel is at a pressure level p and has a temperature T . Let us further assume that its mixing ratio is 10 g kg−1. The parcel is not saturated because at this (p, T ) state 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 109 the saturation mixing ratio is 15 g kg−1. In order to estimate the dew point, we then have to move, as the arrow shows, to the left (lower temperatures) (but remain at the same pressure level) until we “meet” the 10 g kg−1 saturation mixing ratio line. At that tem- perature, the mixing ratio of the parcel is equal to the saturation mixing ratio and thus the parcel becomes saturated. That temper- ature is then the parcel’s dew point temperature. Note that if from (p, T ) we follow the dry adiabat θ1 down to 1000 mb we obtain the potential temperature of the parcel, which will be greater than its temperature, T . 7.2.2 Adiabatic isobaric processes – wet-bulb temperatures Let us now suppose that our system is unsaturated moist air and liquid water and that the mixture has a temperature T and a com- bined water mixing ratio wt =(mv + mw)/md. Since this is an unstable situation the system will tend to approach equilibrium. This will be achieved by water evaporating. If we assume that the system is closed and the process is taking place adiabatically (i.e. the process is also isenthalpic), then the liquid water must draw heat for the evaporation from the unsaturated moist air. Since no other processes are taking place, this decrease in temperature must be related to the change in the mixing ratio of moist air due to evaporating liquid water. Note that, since at any time during this process the system diﬀers slightly from saturation, the process is spontaneous and irreversible. If there is enough liquid water, sat- uration will be reached. The temperature at saturation is called the isobaric wet-bulb temperature, Tw. An important atmospheric process described by this type of transformation is cooling by evap- oration of rain at a given level. The system consists of a certain air mass plus water that evaporates into it from the rain falling through it. If instead of water we had ice present, then we would deﬁne the isobaric ice-bulb temperature, Ti. Note that Tw is not the same as Tdew since the two cooling processes are diﬀerent. Now, if we follow the reverse procedure, we could deﬁne the temperature which air would achieve if all its vapor were to condense in an adiabatic iso- baric process and with the produced water being withdrawn. This limiting temperature is called the isobaric equivalent temperature, Tei. Note, however, that the deﬁnition of this temperature is not a “legal” one. The reason is that we assume that the reverse of an irreversible process can happen, which is not possible. Derivation of the wet-bulb temperature Consider a closed heterogeneous system consisting of dry air, water vapor, and liquid water. If this system undergoes a change, then the change in enthalpy is 110 7 MOIST AIR ΔH = Hf − Hi where the subscripts i and f refer to the initial and ﬁnal states, respectively. We can write the above equation in terms of the three components ΔH =(Hdf + Hvf + Hwf ) − (Hdi + Hvi + Hwi) or ΔH =(mdhdf + mvf hvf + mwf hwf ) − (mdhdi + mvihvi + mwihwi). (7.17) If we recall the deﬁnition of lv (lv = hv − hw) and consider that the total amount of water mt = mv + mw is conserved (i.e. mvi + mwi = mvf + mwf = mt), then the above equation becomes ΔH = md(hdf − hdi)+ mt(hwf − hwi)+ mvf lvf − mvilvi. (7.18) If we now assume that in the range of meteorological interest cpd and cw are nearly independent of temperature, then we can write (recall equation (4.18)) that hdf − hdi = cpd(Tf − Ti) hwf − hwi = cw(Tf − Ti). In addition, if Ti is not greatly diﬀerent from Tf we can assume that lvi = lvf = lv. Then equation (7.18) becomes ΔH = mdcpd(Tf − Ti)+ mtcw(Tf − Ti)+(mvf − mvi)lv or ΔH/md = (cpd + mt md cw ) (Tf − Ti)+ ( mvf − mvi md ) lv or ΔH/md =(cpd + wtcw)(Tf − Ti)+(wf − wi)lv or ΔH/md =(cpd + wtcw)ΔT + lvΔw. (7.19) Note that wt (the total water mixing ratio) is a diﬀerent con- stant for each system and varies only with the concentration of liquid water. As such it does not depend on temperature. Since we have also assumed that cpd,cw,lv ̸= f (T ) we can write the above equation in diﬀerential form: dH/md =(cpd + wtcw)dT + lvdw. (7.20) 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 111 Equation (7.20) is a general expression for the change in enthalpy of a closed heterogeneous system of dry air, water vapor, and liquid water during any process. If we restrict ourselves to isenthalpic processes only, then equation (7.20) becomes (cpd + wtcw)(Ti − Tf )=(wf − wi)lv. (7.21) Equation (7.21) indicates that in an adiabatic isobaric process, where moist air cools from evaporating liquid water, the change in temperature relates to the change in the mixing ratio. It also tells us that Tf depends on wt with Tf becoming minimum when wt → 0. Since mt = mv + mw cannot be zero (if it were neither the mixing ratio nor temperature would change), this condition requires that md →∞. Of course this cannot be true but to a good approximation md ≫ mt. We deﬁne this limiting temperature as the wet-bulb temperature, Tw, which is determined by setting in equation (7.21) Ti = T, Tf = Tw,wi = w, wf = wsw, and wt =0: cpd(T − Tw)=(wsw − w)lv or Tw + lv cpd wsw = T + lv cpd w (7.22) where wsw is the saturation mixing ratio over liquid water at temperature Tw. As expected, since wsw >w, Tw <T . Estimation of the isobaric equivalent temperature In order to estimate this temperature (Tei), the only thing we have to do is to set in equation (7.21) wi = wt = w (the mixing ratio of the moist air), wf =0,Ti = T , and Tf = Tei. Then we obtain Tei = T + lvw cpd + wcw . (7.23) Obviously Tei >T . Also, since for typical values of w (around 10gkg −1) lv/(cpd + wcw) ≈ 2500 it follows that Tei >Tvirt. Neither the wet bulb nor the isobaric equivalent temperatures is estimated graphically. They are calculated from equations (7.22) and (7.23), respectively. Relation between wet-bulb and dew point temperatures If we employ the general approximation w ≈ ϵe/p we can write equation (7.21) as cp(Ti − Tf )= ϵ p (ef − ei)lv 112 7 MOIST AIR where cp = cpd + wtcw. Setting Ti = T, Tf = Tw, and ef = esw(Tw) yields ei = esw(Tw) − pcp lvϵ (T − Tw). From the deﬁnition of dew point temperature we have that ei = esw(Tdew). Then, the above equation becomes esw(Tdew)= esw(Tw) − pcp lvϵ (T − Tw). Since T − Tw > 0 it follows that esw(Tdew) <esw(Tw). Then, from equation (6.17) it follows that Tdew <Tw. Are you keeping up with all these temperatures? Up to now we have discussed ﬁve diﬀerent temperatures: T , temperature; Tvirt, virtual temperature; Tdew, dew point temperature; Tw, isobaric wet-bulb temperature; and Tei, isobaric equivalent temperature. They are related as follows: Tdew <Tw <T <Tvirt <Tei. (7.24) Brace yourself. There are more! 7.2.3 Adiabatic expansion (or compression) of unsaturated moist air Recall Poisson’s equation for an adiabatic expansion or compression of an ideal gas from p, T to p′,T ′ T ′ = T ( p′ p )k which for p′ = 1000 mb deﬁned the potential temperature, θ, θ = T ( 1000 p )k . (7.25) Poisson’s equation is valid for any ideal gas. As such it is valid for moist air provided that the appropriate k is used and that con- densation does not take place. We can then deﬁne the potential temperature of unsaturated moist air as θm = T ( 1000 p )kd(1−0.26q) . (7.26) 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 113 If we substitute T from equation (7.25) applied to dry air into equation (7.26) we obtain (assuming that pd ≈ p) θm = θd ( 1000 p )−kd0.26q or θm = θd ( 1000 p )−0.07q . (7.27) As we have already discussed, in our atmosphere q ≪ 1 which indicates that to a very good approximation θm ≈ θd. As in the case of virtual temperature, here again we can deﬁne the virtual potential temperature, θvirt, by substituting Tvirt for T in equation (7.25): θvirt = Tvirt ( 1000 p )kd . (7.28) This will be the temperature dry air will acquire if it were to expand or compress from a level (Tvirt,p) to the 1000 mb level. Since Tvirt > T it follows that θvirt >θ. Note that even though q and w are very small (of the order of 0.01) we should not jump to the conclusion that all variables or parameters of unsaturated moist air are for all practical purposes the same as those of dry air. If we consider a typical value of q = w =0.01 we ﬁnd that diﬀerences in virtual temperature of the order of 2–3 ◦C are not uncommon. Such diﬀerences are often not negligible. On the other hand, as we saw above, diﬀerences in moist potential temperature are indeed negligible (of the order of 0.1 ◦C). Consequently, from now on the symbol θ will be used to indicate the potential temperature of both dry and unsaturated moist air. Similarly to the dry adiabatic lapse rate we may deﬁne here the moist (unsaturated) adiabatic lapse rate as Γm = g cp = g cpd(1+0.87w) or Γm = Γd 1+0.87w ≈ Γd(1 − 0.87w). (7.29) 7.2.4 Reaching saturation by adiabatic ascent As an unsaturated moist air parcel rises adiabatically, it cools. Dur- ing the ascent (and as long as no condensation occurs) its q or w remains the same but the equilibrium vapor pressure decreases. At the same time the vapor pressure e also decreases. This can be 114 7 MOIST AIR easily seen by recalling that e = wp/(w + ϵ). As w and ϵ remain constant e/p remains constant. Since during the ascent p decreases, e must decrease if e/p must remain constant. Accordingly, when unsaturated moist air ascends adiabatically, its relative humidity (r = e/es) increases only if e decreases at a slower rate than es. If this condition is not met clouds will not form in ascent but they could still form in descent. However, in our experience, clouds never do form as a result of descending air, so this condition is apparently satisﬁed. But what is the mathematics and physics behind it? If we log-diﬀerentiate equation (7.7) we get d ln r = d ln e − d ln esw. (7.30) For moist air, Poisson’s equation tells us that Tp 1−γ γ = constant. Since e/p remains constant, it follows that Te 1−γ γ = constant. Then, again by log-diﬀerentiating, we obtain d ln T = γ − 1 γ d ln e. (7.31) Combining (7.30) and (7.31) with the C–C equation yields d ln r = γ γ − 1 d ln T − lv RvT 2 dT. (7.32) The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the above equation accounts for the change in relative humidity due to the decrease in e while the second accounts for the change in relative humidity due to the temperature decrease. As one term is positive and the other negative, the net result can be either positive or negative. This indicates that adiabatic expansion can lead to an increase or to a decrease in r, which in turn implies that the opposite (i.e. adiabatic compression) can also lead to a decrease or an increase in r. This opens the road to bizarre scenarios where clouds can actually form on descent. If we rewrite equation (7.32) as dr dT = r T ( γ γ − 1 − lv RvT ) , we see that if γ γ − 1 > lv RvT , (7.33) then dr < 0 when dT < 0 and dr > 0 when dT > 0, which would indicate that clouds can form on descent. Assuming the typical values for γ ≈ 1.4,lv =2.5 × 106 Jkg−1, and Rv = 461.5Jkg−1 K −1 we ﬁnd that inequality (7.33) is satisﬁed only when T ≥ 1550 K. Obviously, such a situation does not exist on our planet and clouds can only form on ascent. However, all it takes is an exotic planet whose atmosphere has a condensable gas with smaller lv and all sorts of things may happen. 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 115 Now that we have settled this issue, we can expect that ascend- ing moist unsaturated air will eventually reach a relative humidity of 100%. Immediately after that condensation will take place in order to sustain equilibrium conditions. The level at which satu- ration of ascending unsaturated moist parcels is achieved is called the lifting condensation level (LCL). The temperature at this level, TLCL, is called the saturation temperature. By integrating equa- tion (7.32) from an initial state T, Tdew,r to the ﬁnal state TLCL = Tdew,LCL,rLCL = 1 we obtain − ln r = γ γ − 1 ln TLCL T + lv Rv ( 1 TLCL − 1 T ) . (7.34) Since r = e/esw(T ) and e = esw(Tdew) we have from the C–C equation esw(Tdew)=6.11 exp ( lv 273Rv − lv RvTdew ) and esw(T )=6.11 exp ( lv 273Rv − lv RvT ) . Dividing the above two equations and taking logs yields − ln r = lv Rv ( T − Tdew TTdew ) . Accordingly, equation (7.34) becomes T − Tdew TTdew = A ln TLCL T + ( 1 TLCL − 1 T ) (7.35) where A = ( γ γ − 1 )∕( lv Rv ) . Equation (7.35) can be solved numerically to provide the saturation temperature TLCL from T and Tdew. If you would rather not solve this equation you may use the approximation provided by Bolton (1980) TLCL = 1 1 T −55 − ln r 2840 +55, (7.36) where T is in K, r = w/wsw,wsw = ϵ[esw/(p − esw)], esw = 6.11 exp(19.83 − 5417/T ), and T − Tdew = −RvTTdew ln r/lv. A parcel that rises from an initial level where the temperature is T to a level where the temperature is TLCL has expanded. Therefore, the vapor density at LCL is smaller than that at the initial level. From the ideal gas law it then follows that e(TLCL) <e(T ). Because 116 7 MOIST AIR TLCL = Tdew,LCL and e(T )= esw(Tdew) this inequality is equivalent to esw(TLCL) <esw(Tdew). Then from equation (6.17) it follows that TLCL <Tdew. Thus, relation (7.24) can be extended to include yet one more temperature: TLCL <Tdew <Tw <T <Tv <Tei. (7.37) Estimating the height of LCL The height of LCL for a given parcel (zLCL) depends only on its temperature and relative humidity. At zLCL the parcel’s tempera- ture equals its dew point: TLCL = Tdew,LCL. As the parcel is lifted from a reference level z0 its temperature decreases according to T (z)= T0 − Γd(z − z0) (7.38) where T0 is the temperature of the parcel of z0 and we have assumed that Γm ≈ Γd. Similarly, its dew point temperature decreases according to Tdew(z)= Tdew,0 − Γdew(z − z0). (7.39) Here both Γd and Γdew are considered constant. From equations (7.38) and (7.39) we have that TLCL = T0 − Γd(zLCL − z0) Tdew,LCL = Tdew,0 − Γdew(zLCL − z0) or since TLCL = Tdew,LCL, zLCL − z0 = T0 − Tdew,0 Γd − Γdew . (7.40) In the above equation we know everything except for Γdew. In order to estimate Γdew we proceed as follows. The equation that deﬁnes dew point is e = esw(Tdew). Diﬀerentiation with respect to z gives desw(Tdew) dz = de dz or desw(Tdew) dTdew dTdew dz = de dz . (7.41) Now we know that e = wp/(w + ϵ). If we assume that w remains constant until condensation occurs, we have de dz = w w + ϵ dp dz or de dz = e p dp dz = esw(Tdew) p dp dz . (7.42) 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 117 Combining equations (7.41) and (7.42) gives 1 esw(Tdew) desw(Tdew) dTdew dTdew dz = 1 p dp dz . After considering the C–C equation we can reduce the above to lv RvT 2 dew dTdew dz = 1 p dp dz . (7.43) Since the ascent is assumed to be adiabatic, we have from Poisson’s equation that d ln T = γ − 1 γ d ln p or dT Tdz = γ − 1 γ dp pdz . (7.44) From equations (7.43) and (7.44) it follows that lv RvT 2 dew dTdew dz = γ γ − 1 dT Tdz = γ (γ − 1)T (− g cpd ) or assuming γ ≈ γd lv RvT 2 dew dTdew dz = − g RdT which then gives Γdew = − dTdew dz = g ϵlv T 2 dew T . The value of the right-hand side in the atmosphere ranges from about 1.7 to 1.9 ◦Ckm−1. Therefore we can assume that on the average Tdew decreases with height at the rate of Γdew =1.8 ◦Ckm−1. By dropping the subscript 0 in equation (7.40) it follows that the height of LCL is given by the approximate relationship zLCL − z ≈ T − Tdew 8 . (7.45) Equations (7.35) or (7.36) and (7.45) give the temperature and height (in km) of the level where clouds begin to form from the temperature and dew point temperature at some reference level z. Reaching saturation via adiabatic ascent and the estimation of TLCL 118 7 MOIST AIR Figure 7.4 Illustration of the estimation procedure of the lifting condensation level and saturation temperature. TLCL 1000 p(mb) (p, T ) p Tdew pLCL(zLCL) Tθ2 θ2 θ1 θ1 > θ2 10 g kg–1 15 g kg–1 and the height of LCL can be visualized in Figure 7.4. The setup in this ﬁgure is the same as in Figure 7.3. Since the parcel is initially unsaturated, as it ascents, it follows the dry adiabat passing from its initial state (p, T ) (recall that θm ≈ θd). As it rises (follow the arrow) it cools and approaches the wsw =10 g kg−1 line, which it intersects at a pressure level (height) pLCL(zLCL). At that point, the temperature is TLCL. As the ﬁgure illustrates, TLCL <Tdew. 7.2.5 Saturated ascent Once saturation is reached, further ascent results in a further increase in relative humidity, which means that the vapor pressure becomes greater than the equilibrium vapor pressure. At this point, the system will return to equilibrium after the “extra” water vapor condenses and water droplets (or ice depending on the temperature) form on condensation nuclei. From this point on two extreme pos- sibilities may be considered. (1) The condensation products remain in the parcel. This is a reversible process because if we reverse the ascent the products will evaporate. It is also adiabatic as we assume that no heat is exchanged between the parcel and the envi- ronment. Since it is reversible and adiabatic it is also isentropic. (2) All condensation products fall out and the parcel consists always 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 119 of dry air plus saturated water vapor. This makes the parcel an open system. Obviously, this process is neither reversible nor adi- abatic and thus it is not isentropic. We will call this process a pseudo-adiabatic process. In reality these two extreme cases may never exist as some condensation products are likely to remain sus- pended in the parcel. However, because of the conditions imposed the extreme cases are easier to treat. Nevertheless, the study of the extreme cases oﬀers useful insights and approximations for the real cases in between. Reversible saturated adiabatic process Since the process is assumed to be reversible, the heterogeneous system of dry air, water vapor, and liquid water (or ice if it is too cold) must be at equilibrium at all times. In this case the total entropy of the system, S, is conserved: S = Sd + Sv + Sw = constant. If we divide all the terms in the above equation by the mass of dry air we arrive at the following expression S md = sd + mv md sv + mw md sw. Recalling that the parcel is saturated (w = wsw) and the deﬁnition of the total water mixing ratio (wt =(mv + mw)/md), the above equation can be written as S md = sd + wswsv +(wt − wsw)sw. (7.46) For a reversible process dS = δQ T = dU T + pdV T = 1 T [( ∂U ∂T ) V dT + ( ∂U ∂V ) T dV ] + p T dV. (7.47) In addition, dS = ( ∂S ∂T ) V dT + ( ∂S ∂V ) T dV. (7.48) From equations (7.47) and (7.48) it follows that ( ∂S ∂T ) V = 1 T ( ∂U ∂T ) V (7.49) and ( ∂S ∂V ) T = 1 T [( ∂U ∂V ) T + p] . (7.50) 120 7 MOIST AIR For liquid water and water vapor in equilibrium at temperature T and pressure p equation (7.50) gives T Sv − Sw Vv − Vw = Uv − Uw Vv − Vw + p or T (Sv − Sw)= Uv − Uw + p(Vv − Vw). If we use equation (6.3) the above equation becomes T (Sv − Sw)= Hv − Hw = Lv or T (sv − sw)= lv. Substituting sv from the above equation into equation (7.46) results in S md = sd + wtsw + lvwsw T . (7.51) Now recall that sd = cpd ln T − Rd ln pd + constant [p = pd + esw(T )] and, from equation (5.9), sw = cw ln T + constant. Accordingly, equation (7.51) becomes S md =(cpd + wtcw)ln T − Rd ln pd + lvwsw T + constant. (7.52) Since here S and md are conserved, it follows that (cpd + wtcw)ln T − Rd ln pd + lvwsw T = constant ′. (7.53) As previously, here we can assume that wt,cpd,cw ̸= f (T ). However, wsw through equations (7.5) and (6.17) is a function of T .Ifwe assume that lv is a function of T (and that may be a good idea here as the parcel may rise to very cold temperatures), then we can write equation (7.53) in diﬀerential form as follows: (cpd + wtcw)d ln T − Rdd ln pd + d ( lvwsw T ) =0. (7.54) Equations (7.53) and (7.54) describe reversible saturated adiabatic processes. Note again that here T and p correspond to saturation. If we now deﬁne θ′ as θ′ = T ( 1000 pd )Rd/(cpd+wtcw) (7.55) 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 121 it follows that (cpd + wtcw)d ln θ′ =(cpd + wtcw)d ln T − Rdd ln pd. (7.56) Combining (7.56) and (7.54) gives (cpd + wtcw)d ln θ′ = −d ( lvwsw T ) or d ln θ′ = −d [ lvwsw (cpd + wtcw)T ] . Integrating the above equation results in θ′ exp [ lvwsw (cpd + wtcw)T ] = constant. (7.57) The above equation deﬁnes the family of curves that describe reversible saturated adiabatic processes. We can evaluate equation (7.57) at a state where all the vapor has condensed (wsw = 0). This deﬁnes a new temperature, the equivalent potential temperature θe given by θe = θ′ exp [ lvwsw (cpd + wtcw)T ] = constant. (7.58) Although θe is deﬁned for saturated air it can also be deﬁned for unsaturated air at temperature T , pressure p, and mixing ratio w by considering it to be lifted to the LCL. At LCL we have θ′ = TLCL ( 1000 pd )Rd/(cpd+wtcw) (equation (7.55)) and thus θe = TLCL ( 1000 pd )Rd/(cpd+wtcw) exp [ lv(TLCL)w (cpd + wtcw)TLCL ] . (7.59) Note that in the above two expressions pd = pLCL − esw(TLCL). Another way to express θe for unsaturated air at T, p, w is given by Emanuel (1994): θe = T ( 1000 pd )Rd/(cpd+wtcw) r−wRv/(cpd+wtcw) × exp [lvw/(cpd + wtcw)T ] (7.60) where r is the relative humidity. Here pd = p − e(T ). When the initial mixing ratio is zero, both (7.59) and (7.60) give (as expected) θe = θ, the potential temperature. 122 7 MOIST AIR Recall that the moist potential temperature θm(7.26) is θm = T ( 1000 p )Rd/cpd(1−0.26w) . Comparison between θm(≈ θ) and θ′ indicates that θ′ is only approximately equal to θ. Given the deﬁnition of θ′, it follows from (7.60) that the equivalent potential temperature is approximately equal to the potential temperature a parcel would have if it were lifted to very low pressure so that all its water vapor condensed (w = 0). Pseudo-adiabatic processes The description of reversible saturated adiabatic processes depends on the value of wt. The problem with this dependence is that although wsw can be determined at a given state, (p, T ),wt can- not. The liquid water mixing ratio can take on any value and as such at a given (p, T ) point there may exist an inﬁnite number of reversible saturated adiabats. If we were to describe such a pro- cess in the (p, T ) domain this would present a great inconvenience. This problem can be dealt with by deﬁning a new process called a pseudo-adiabatic process. In such a process we do away with liq- uid water by assuming that it is removed as soon as it is produced. Obviously, our system is now an open system and this process is not reversible. However, we can think of the whole process as a two-step process. During the ﬁrst step we have a reversible saturated adia- batic process, with condensation of a mass of water (dmw). During the second step the water produced is leaving the system. For the ﬁrst step the entropy may be deﬁned as previously but with the liquid water term omitted. Accordingly, we set in equation (7.52) wt = wsw and we obtain S md =(cpd+wswcw)ln T −Rd ln pd+( lvwsw T )+constant. (7.61) Since in this stage S and md are conserved we can write the above equation in diﬀerential form d[(cpd + wswcw)ln T ] − Rdd ln pd + d ( lvwsw T ) =0. (7.62) After water forms it is removed immediately, thereby decreasing the entropy of the system. However, this process has no eﬀect on the values of T and p. As such equation (7.62) describes the variation of p and T in a pseudo-adiabatic process. Equation (7.62) is very similar to equation (7.54) but here wsw depends on temperature whereas wt in equation (7.54) does not. This makes equation (7.62) very diﬃcult to solve analytically. However, numerical techniques 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 123 can be employed to deﬁne, similarly to the case of the equivalent potential temperature, a pseudo-equivalent potential temperature, θep. As is shown in Bolton (1980), within 0.3 ◦C,θep is given by θep = T ( 1000 p )0.285(1−0.28w) exp [ w(1+0.81w) ( 3376 TLCL − 2.54)] (7.63) where (T, p, w) is any state of the parcel saturated or not (w here is dimensionless and T, TLCL are in K). The pseudo-equivalent potential temperature can be interpreted as the actual temperature achieved by the parcel under the fol- lowing thermodynamic processes: (a) pseudo-adiabatic expansion to zero (or to a very low) pressure level at which we can assume that all water vapor has condensed and fallen out, and (b) sub- sequent dry adiabatic descent to 1000 mb. Note that according to the deﬁnition of θe (the condensation products do not leave the parcel) no similar meaning can be attached to θe. Nevertheless, the diﬀerences in the temperature of a parcel in a reversible sat- urated adiabatic and in a pseudo-adiabatic process are not great and are often neglected as processes in the atmosphere lie some- where in between true reversible saturated adiabatic processes and pseudo-adiabatic processes. This can be easily veriﬁed if we assume that wsw ≈ wt ≪ cpd (i.e. cpd + wswcw ≈ cpd) and pd ≫ ews (i.e. p ≈ pd). In this case equations (7.54) and (7.62) become identical: cpdd ln T − Rdd ln p + d (wswlv/T )=0. Graphically a saturated ascent can be described with the following diagram (Figure 7.5). At LCL the parcel is saturated. Now, as it continues to rise, it follows a path (depicted by the broken line) dictated by the saturated adiabat passing through (pLCL,TLCL) (in practice by the pseudo-adiabat, i.e. from equation (7.62) or (7.63)). At some very low pressure level (say, 200 mb), we may assume that all vapor has condensed and the condensation products have fallen out. At that limit, the pseudo-adiabat approaches a dry adiabat (solid line). This dry adiabat corresponds to θep (in other words if followed down to 1000 mb, it gives the pseudo-equivalent potential temperature). 7.2.6 A few more temperatures The dry adiabatic descent from zero pressure level to the 1000 mb level deﬁned the pseudo-equivalent potential temperature, θep.At the original (p,T) level it deﬁnes the pseudo-equivalent tempera- ture, Tep (Figure 7.6). Since the descent is dry adiabatic we have that 124 7 MOIST AIR Figure 7.5 Illustration of the estimation procedure of the pseudo-equivalent potential temperature. θθep T 1000 200 p (mb) p (p, T ) (PLCL, TLCL) Tep = θep ( p 1000 )kd . Since T = θ (p/1000) kd it follows that Tep = T θep θ . (7.64) During the process by which Tep is deﬁned, much more water vapor condenses than it would have if it condensed during an adiabatic isobaric process at an initial level below LCL. Therefore (recall the deﬁnition of Tei), if all that vapor were to condense at the initial level it would result in a temperature greater than Tei. Thus, Tep >Tei, which makes Tep the highest temperature. Many more temperatures can be deﬁned but I will spare you this! Just keep in mind that at a given state, if the air is unsaturated, a dry adiabat can be followed to 1000 mb to deﬁne a corresponding potential temperature. As such from the state (Tei,p) the isobaric equivalent potential temperature, θei, can be deﬁned. Because Tep > Tei it follows that θep >θei. It also follows that θep >θ. Similarly, if the air is saturated, a pseudo-adiabat can be fol- lowed to either the original pressure level or to the 1000 mb level to deﬁne yet more temperatures. For example, and recalling that 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 125 Figure 7.6 Illustration of the estimation procedure of Tep,Twp, and θwp. θθepθwp T 1000 p 200 p (mb) (PLCL, TLCL) Twp Tep (p, T ) Tw is attained at saturation in an adiabatic process, following the pseudo-adiabat corresponding to point (TLCL,pLCL)to(T, p) level deﬁnes the pseudo-wet-bulb temperature, Twp, and continuing down to 1000 mb deﬁnes the pseudo-wet-bulb potential tempera- ture θwp (see Figure 7.6). Obviously, since both θep and θwp are deﬁned by the same curve they must be related and conserved in a pseudo-adiabatic process. θwp can be estimated from equa- tion (7.63) by setting T = TLCL = θwp and w = w′ = ws(p = 1000 mb,T = θwp), i.e. θep = θwp exp [ w′(1+0.81w′) ( 3376 θwp − 2.54)] . (7.65) Similarly, following the pseudo-adiabat passing through point (Tw,p) to 1000 mb deﬁnes the isobaric wet-bulb potential temperature θw. Here we should note that Twp and Tw (or θwp and θw) are not exactly the same. Tw and θw correspond to a true saturated adiabatic process whereas Twp and θwp correspond to a pseudo-adiabatic process. Since water remains around in a true saturated adiabatic process it turns out that Twp <Tw and θwp <θw. It is interesting to note here that if at the initial point (p, T ) (see Figure 7.6), the amount of vapor content (w) is higher, then the dry 126 7 MOIST AIR adiabatic ascent will last a shorter time and therefore the LCL will be found at higher pressure and temperature. The pseudo-adiabat passing through this point will be of a greater temperature than before. This means that higher θwp (or θep) values would correspond to higher moisture (in accordance with 7.63). Here is then the ﬁnal breakdown of all the temperatures and potential temperatures and their relationships: TLCL <Tdew <Twp <Tw <T <Tvirt <Tei <Tep (7.66) θwp <θw <θ(≈ θm) <θvirt <θei <θep. 7.2.7 Saturated adiabatic lapse rate Since condensation of water vapor releases heat during a reversible saturated adiabatic ascent, the cooling of the ascending air slows down. As such the corresponding lapse rate should be smaller than that of the dry or moist unsaturated adiabatic ascent. We could derive an expression for this saturated lapse rate, Γs,by starting with equation (7.54) cp dT T − Rd dpd pd + d ( lvwsw T ) =0 where cp = cpd + wtcw. Multiplying all terms of the above equation by T/cp gives dT − RdT cppd d(p − esw)+ 1 cp d(lvwsw) − lvwsw cpT dT =0, where we have considered that p = pd +esw. The second term, using the C–C equation in the form desw/dT = eswlv/RvT 2 and the fact that Rdesw/Rvpd = wsw, can be written as − RdT cppd dp + wswlv cpT dT. Substituting this into the previous equation, dividing all terms by dz, assuming that dp ≈ dpd, and using the hydrostatic approximation, leads to dT dz = − g cp − 1 cp d dz (lvwsw). (7.67) Note that since in the above equation cp ̸= cpd, the term −g/cp is not exactly the dry adiabatic lapse rate. By performing the diﬀer- entiation on the right-hand side we can write equation (7.67) as 7.2 PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 127 dT dz = − g cp − wsw cp dlv dz − lv cp dwsw dz or dT dz = − g cp − wsw cp dlv dT dT dz − lv cp dwsw dz or (1+ wsw cp dlv dT ) dT dz = − g cp − lv cp dwsw dz . (7.68) Using equation (6.12) the above equation becomes [ 1 − wsw(cw − cpv) cp ] dT dz = − g cp − lv cp dwsw dz . Typical values for cw,cpv,cp, and wsw are 4220 J kg−1 K −1, 1850 J kg−1 K −1, 1050 J kg−1 K −1, and 0.01, respectively. Such values make the term wsw(cw − cpv)/cp of the order of 0.02. As such, it can be neglected to arrive at the following approximation dT dz = − g cp − lv cp dwsw dz . (7.69) Now all we have to do is to ﬁnd an expression for dwsw/dz. Log- diﬀerentiating equation (7.5) leads to 1 wsw dwsw dz = − 1 p dp dz + 1 esw desw dz = − 1 p dp dz + 1 esw desw dT dT dz where p is the total pressure of the parcel or the surroundings. If we again use the hydrostatic approximation and the C–C equation the above equation becomes 1 wsw dwsw dz = g RT + lv RvT 2 dT dz . (7.70) Combining equations (7.70) and (7.69) leads to Γs = − dT dz = g cp 1+ lvwsw/RT 1+ l2 vwsw/cpRvT 2 (7.71) where cp = cpd + wtcw and R is the gas constant for the surround- ings. In other thermodynamics books you may ﬁnd some slight diﬀerences in the formula giving Γs. Most of the diﬀerences are due to certain assumptions and approximations. For typical values of saturation mixing ratio and temperature in the lower troposphere, Γs ranges around 5 ◦Ckm−1, which is half the dry adiabatic rate. 128 7 MOIST AIR 7.3 Other processes of interest 7.3.1 Adiabatic isobaric mixing Let us consider two air masses of temperatures T1 and T2 and humidities q1 and q2, which are mixing at the same pressure. This corresponds to a horizontal mixing. If we assume the mixing to be an adiabatic process, then it is also isenthalpic. If we assume that no condensation takes place, then we can write for the change in enthalpy of the whole system ΔH = m1Δh1 + m2Δh2 = 0 (7.72) where Δh1 = cp1ΔT = cp1(T − T1) Δh2 = cp2ΔT = cp2(T − T2) and T is the ﬁnal temperature of the mixture. Considering equation (7.11), equation (7.72) becomes m1cpd(1+0.87q1)(T − T1)+ m2cpd(1+0.87q2)(T − T2)=0. Solving for T we get T = (m1T1 + m2T2)+0.87(m1q1T1 + m2q2T2) m +0.87mv . (7.73) In the above expression m = m1 + m2 is the total mass and mv = m1q1 + m2q2 is the total water vapor mass. Since there is no condensation, mv remains constant. If the ﬁnal speciﬁc humidity is q, then the water vapor mass is qm. It follows that q = m1q1 + m2q2 m (7.74) i.e. the ﬁnal q is the weighted average of q1 and q2. Using equation (7.74) we can rewrite equation (7.73) as T = (m1T1 + m2T2)+0.87(m1q1T1 + m2q2T2) m(1+0.87q) . (7.75) If we neglect all vapor terms the above equation becomes T ≈ m1T1 + m2T2 m (7.76) indicating that, approximately, the temperature of the mixture is also the weighted average of the initial temperatures. One can 7.3 OTHER PROCESSES OF INTEREST 129 show that the potential temperature and the vapor pressure of the mixture will also, approximately, be the weighted averages of the initial values (see problem 7.1): θ ≈ m1θ1 + m2θ2 m (7.77) e ≈ m1e1 + m2e2 m . (7.78) Equations (7.76) and (7.78) indicate that in a vapor pressure– temperature diagram (Figure 7.7) if the two masses correspond to points A1 and A2 then the mixture will correspond to the point A which will lie on the straight line connecting A1 and A2. From the similarity of triangles AA ′ 1A1 and A2A′ 2A it follows that point A will be found at a distance such that A1A/AA2 = AA ′ 1/A2A′ 2 = (T1 − T )/(T − T2)= m2/m1 (here equation (7.76) was used). The thin solid lines in Figure 7.3 represent the equal relative humidity curves corresponding to points A1,A2, and A. Because of their cur- vature it can easily be seen that the ﬁnal relative humidity will be greater than the weighted average. This can easily be visualized if we consider the simple case where the air masses have the same rel- ative humidity, i.e. points A1 and A2 lie on the same equal relative humidity curve (Figure 7.8). Then point A will lie to the left of the curve indicating that the ﬁnal relative humidity is greater than the weighted average, (mr + mr)/2m = r. We conclude that iso- baric adiabatic mixing increases the relative humidity. This is a very interesting result because it implies that two air masses that are ini- tially unsaturated (but close to saturation) may result in a mixture that is supersaturated. In this case condensation will occur. This mechanism can produce mixing fogs and other important processes in the atmosphere. Figure 7.7 When two initially unsaturated air masses (A1 at r1 and A2 at r2) mix isobarically, the final product (A) may be saturated. e e1 r > r1 > r2 r = 1 r1 r2 e2 T2 T1 A2’ A1’ A2 A1 A T T e 130 7 MOIST AIR Figure 7.8 When two saturated (r =1) air masses (A1 and A2) mix isobarically the final product (A) is supersaturated. e T A2 A A1 r = 1 7.3.2 Vertical mixing Let us now look at vertical mixing occurring because of turbulent and/or convective processes. Such a process is much more com- plicated than the previous one because now the vertical variation of T and p come into the picture. However, we can simplify the treatment of vertical mixing by (1) considering two isolated air masses m1 and m2 at pressure levels p1 and p2 (p1 >p2) and tem- peratures T1 and T2, which are taken to a pressure level p where they mix isobarically, and (2) redistributing the mixture in the layer Δp = p1 − p2. The excursions to level p can be considered as adiabatic ascent and descent (during which the speciﬁc humidities q1 and q2 remain constant) resulting in new temperatures for the air masses: T ′ 1 = T1 ( p p1 )k T ′ 2 = T2 ( p p2 )k . Once at level p the air masses mix isobarically. From what we discussed in the previous section it follows that in this case T ≈ m1T ′ 1 + m2T ′ 2 m q ≈ m1q1 + m2q2 m (7.79) and θ ≈ m1θ1 + m2θ2 m where θ1 and θ2 are the initial potential temperature values, which remain constant during the adiabatic ascent and descent. The subsequent redistribution of the mixture in the layer Δp 7.3 OTHER PROCESSES OF INTEREST 131 will preserve θ assuming that it consists of adiabatic ascents and descents. It follows that when the layer is well mixed, θ will not vary with height. We can generalize equation (7.79) by considering mixing of n air masses and employing the general expression for the weighted average. For example, θ = ∫ m 0 θdm m , q = ∫ m 0 qdm m , w = ∫ m 0 wdm m . Using the hydrostatic approximation we can express the above equations as x = ∫ z 0 xρdz ∫ z 0 ρdz = − ∫ p2 p1 xdp p1 − p2 where x is θ,or q,or w. The temperature variation with pressure can then be expressed according to T = θ ( p 1000 )k . (7.80) If in the initial distribution (before mixing) there is a level (p, T < T ), where r = r, then this level is deﬁned as the mixing condensation level. 7.3.3 Freezing inside a cloud As air rises and cools and clouds begin to form, it is often the case that the developing cloud would reach the freezing level. From that point on, freezing of cloud droplets (or rain drops) would occur and water vapor and ice will co-exist. Does this freezing aﬀect the further development of the cloud? We can get an answer to this question by making the following simple assumptions: 1) Initially the air is saturated with respect to water at temperature T . 2) As water freezes latent heat is released into the environment. 3) Once water freezes, water vapor is supersaturated with respect to ice. Depotition is then initiated releasing more latent heat. This continues until the vapor pressure becomes equal to the saturation vapor pressure over ice. 4) The whole process occurs at a constant pressure level and it is adiabatic. Since it is adiabatic and isobaric, it is also isenthalpic. 132 7 MOIST AIR Accordingly, we can divide this process into three “treatable” steps: Step 1: Water freezes at a constant temperature T . In this case we have a change of phase at constant pressure and the change in enthalpy is (see Chapter 6) ΔH1 = −δQp=constant = −Lf = −lfmw where mw is the amount of water that freezes. The minus sign is due to the fact that heat is released. Dividing the above equation by the mass of dry air yields ΔH1 md = −lfww(T ) (7.81) Step 2: Vapor condenses on ice at a constant temperature T until the water vapor pressure become the saturation vapor pressure over ice at a temperature T ′ >T . Like in Step 1, the change in enthalpy during this step will be ΔH2 = −ls(mw − mi) or ΔH2 md = −ls[ww(T ) − wi(T ′)] (7.82) Step 3: The whole system is warmed from T to T ′. The change in enthalpy during this term will be (recall 4.18) ΔH3 = CpΔT or ΔH3 md = cpdΔT (7.83) where it is assumed that Cp/md ≈ cpd. Since the whole process is isenthalpic, it follows that −lfww(T ) − ls[ww(T ) − wi(T ′)] + cpdΔT =0 or ΔT = lfww(T )+ ls[ww(T ) − wi(T ′)] cpd or using (7.5) ΔT = ϵlfesw(T )+ ϵls[esw(T ) − esi(T ′)] pcpd . EXAMPLES 133 In the above equation and in the range of typical conditions in our atmosphere, the right-hand side is positive. As such the eﬀect of freezing is to increase the temperature inside the developing cloud. Typically, this temperature increase is of the order of 3 K, a signiﬁcant warming during cloud development. Examples (7.1) The initial state of a parcel of air is p = 1000 mb, T = 30 ◦C, w = 14 g kg −1. Find (a) r, (b) Tvirt, (c) Tdew, (d) Tw, (e) Tei, (f) TLCL, (g) zLCL, (h) θep, (i) Tep, (j) θwp, (k) θvirt. (a) From equation (6.17) we estimate that esw(T )= 43.1 mb. From equation (7.3) we then ﬁnd that e(T ) ≈ 22.0 mb. Thus, r ≈ 0.51, wsw ≈ 28 g kg−1. (b) Tvirt =(1 + 0.61q)T = [1+0.61 ( w 1+w )] T = 305.55 K. (c) From equation (7.16) we obtain Tdew = 291.75 K. (d) From equation (7.22) we have Tw = T + lv cpd (w − wsw) where lv(T = 303 K) = 2.43 × 10 6 Jkg−1. Now recall that wsw in the above formula is the saturation mix- ing ratio at Tw. Making use of the approximations in equations (7.5) and (6.17) we have Tw = T + lvϵ cpdp [ e(T ) − 6.11 exp (19.83 − 5417 Tw )] Numerical solution of the above equation gives Tw ≈ 295.4K. (e) From equation (7.23) for cw = 4218 J kg−1 we ﬁnd that Tei ≈ 335 K. (f) From equation (7.36) it follows that TLCL ≈ 289 K. (g) From equation (7.45) and assuming that the initial level is z = 0 we ﬁnd that zLCL =1.4 km. (h) Using equation (7.63) with T = 303 K,p = 1000 mb, w =0.014 g kg−1,TLCL = 289 K, we obtain that θep ≈ 345 K. (i) From equation (7.64) it follows (since T = θ) that Tep = θep = 345 K. (j) Considering that w′ = ws (1000 mb,T = θwp)= (ϵ/p)6.11 exp[19.83 − (5417/θwp)], numerical solution of equation (7.65) yields θwp ≈ 295 K. (k) From equation (7.28) and since p = 1000 mb it follows that θvirt = Tvirt = 305.55 K. 134 7 MOIST AIR Note that all estimated temperatures and potential temper- atures are consistent with equation (7.66). (7.2) The temperature of saturated air at 1000 mb is 10 ◦C as it begins to drop through radiation loss. As a result, some water vapor condenses and radiation fog forms. During the formation of fog, 12 × 10 3 Jkg−1, of heat is lost to the surroundings. Find the final temperature and the decrease in vapor pressure. The process is non-adiabatic and thus non-isenthalpic. From equation (7.20) we have dh = cpdT + lvdw where cp = cpd + wtcw and we have assumed that dH/md ≈ dh. During the process the air remains in a state of satura- tion, thus w corresponds to saturation. Also, the process is isobaric, so dh = δq and we can write the above equation as δq = cpdT + lvdwsw. (7.84) Using the approximate relationship wsw ≈ ϵesw/p, we ﬁnd that dwsw ≈ (ϵ/p)desw or, using the C–C equation, dwsw = ϵ p lvesw RvT 2 dT. (7.85) By substituting (7.82) into (7.81) we obtain δq = (cp + ϵl2 vesw pRvT 2 ) dT. In the above equation, cp is to a good approximation independent of temperature. Also, for small temperature changes, lv is nearly independent of temperature. The sat- uration vapor pressure, however, is dependent on T (via equation (6.17)). This makes the integration of the above equation very diﬃcult. One way to overcome this diﬃculty is to assume that esw/T 2 is nearly constant for small tempera- ture diﬀerences and then treat the diﬀerentials as diﬀerences. In this case, for T =10 ◦C, esw =12.16 mb,lv(10 ◦C) = 2.4774 × 10 6 Jkg−1,δq = −12 × 103 Jkg−1, and cp ≈ cpd = 1005 J kg−1 K −1, we ﬁnd that ΔT = −5.3 ◦C. Thus, the ﬁnal temperature is 4.7 ◦C. Note that this result can be improved if we do not assume that cp ≈ cpd. However, this will require the value of wt which is not known. We could of course assume that wt ≈ wsw(10 ◦C) and consider cp ≈ cpd + wswcw. In this case, we ﬁnd that the diﬀerence in the result is small (∼ 0.066 ◦C). In order to ﬁnd the decrease in vapor EXAMPLES 135 pressure we combine equation (7.81) with dwsw ≈ (ϵ/p)desw to arrive at δq = cpdT + lvϵ p desw. Then incorporating the C–C equation gives δq = ( cpRvT 2 lvesw + lvϵ p ) desw. Here again if we treat the diﬀerentials as diﬀerences and use the values mentioned above we ﬁnd that Δesw = −4.326 mb. (7.3) Two equal air masses, both at 1000 mb, mix adiabatically. Their initial temperatures and mixing ratios are T1 = 293.8 K, w1 =16.3g kg−1, T2 = 266.4 K, and w2 =1.3g kg−1. First show that the mixture is supersaturated. Then find the final temperature, the final mixing ratio, the amount of liquid water content per unit mass of air, and the amount of liquid water per unit volume of air. As the two air masses mix isobarically, the initial tempera- ture of the mixture will be (equation (7.75)) T = 280.2K. Since q1 =16.0386 g kg−1 and q2 =1.2983 g kg−1 we ﬁnd that, for the mixture, q =8.6685 g kg−1 (equation (7.74)), w = q/(1 − q)=8.7443 g kg−1, and e = wp/(ϵ + w)= 13.86 mb (using the approximate equations (7.76) and (7.78) results in T = 280.7 K and e =14.1 mb). For T = 280.2 K equation (6.17) yields esw =10.05 mb. This result indicates that initially the mixture is supersaturated (e>esw). Thus, immediately after mixing the excess vapor will condense so that the mixture reaches the equilibrium state (T ′,e ′). This step, graphically shown in Figure 7.9, will result in a decrease in vapor pressure and an increase in temperature (remember the mixing is adiabatic, so the Figure 7.9 Diagram for example 7.3. When two initially saturated air masses mix isobarically, the final product is supersaturated (T, e). In order for the mixture to reach the equilibrium state (T ′,e′), the excess vapor will condense. The amount of vapor that condenses is proportional to the difference e − e ′. e T r = 1 (T, e) (T2, e2) (T ’2, e) (T ’, e’) e’ = esw(T ’)(T1, e1) 136 7 MOIST AIR heat gain due to condensation remains in the mixture). The increase in temperature is denoted by the line connecting points (T, e) and (T ′,e) and the decrease in water vapor pres- sure by the line connecting points (T ′,e ′) and (T ′,e). Since the process from (T, e)to(T ′,e ′) is isobaric and adiabatic it is isenthalpic. As such, equation (7.21) applies: (cpd + wtcw)(T − T ′)=(w′ − w)lv or (cpd + wtcw)(T − T ′)=(e ′ − e)lv ϵ p or (cpd + wtcw)(T − T ′)= [ 6.11 exp (19.83 − 5417 T ′ ) − e ] lv ϵ p where, assuming that the mixture is a closed system, wt = w =8.7443 g kg−1. Numerical solution of the above equation, with cw = 4218 J kg−1 K −1 and lv =2.4774 × 10 6 Jkg−1, gives T ′ ≈ 282.8 K. This corresponds to e ′ = esw(T ′) = 12 mb and hence to w′ =7.55 g kg−1. The amount of liquid water produced per unit mass of air is given by the diﬀerence q − q′ ≈ w − w′ ≈ ϵ p (e − e ′) ≈ 1.16 g kg−1. This amount must be equal to the decrease of water vapor per unit mass, −dmv, which is proportional to the decrease in water vapor pressure, −desw. From the ideal gas law we know that the mass of water vapor per unit vol- ume at temperature T is esw/RvT and its variation with temperature is desw/dT = desw/RvT − (esw/RvT 2)dT. Using the C–C equation we can verify that the second term on the right-hand side of the above equation is much smaller than the ﬁrst term. As such, the amount of water vapor lost is approximately equal to desw/RvT . It follows that the amount of liquid water per volume is equal to desw/RvT ,or equal to e − e ′ RvT ≈ 1.44 g m−3. (7.4) The following problem (Salby, 1996) is a classic example, demon- strating the effect of the downslope wind called Chinook wind (Chinook in American Indian means “snow-eater”). Moist air from the Pacific is forced to rise over the continental divide. On the west side, the surface lies at 800 mb where the temperature is 293 K and the mixing ratio is 15 g kg−1. If the summit lies at 600 mb and assuming that any condensation products fall out, EXAMPLES 137 find the surface temperature and relative humidity at a place on the leeward side at 830 mb. For T = 293 K equation (6.17) gives esw =23.4 mb. From equation (7.4) we then ﬁnd that the saturation mixing ratio at state (T, p, w): (293 K, 800 mb, 15 g kg−1)is18.74 g kg−1. Since w< ws, the parcel is initially unsaturated. As the air begins to rise over the mountain it cools and its relative humidity increases. From equation (7.36) we ﬁnd that, for r =15/18.74=0.8,TLCL = 288.7K. The ascent to the level where the air ﬁrst becomes saturated is described by Poisson’s equation pLCL = p ( TLCL T )1/k where k = kd(1 − 0.26 w)=0.2849. It follows that pLCL ≈ 760 mb. At this point the air is saturated. As it continues to rise condensation takes place and all condensation prod- ucts fall out. As such, the ascent above pLCL is described by a pseudo-adiabatic process. Therefore, θep from 760 to 600 mb is conserved. From equation (7.63) we ﬁnd, for T = TLCL = 288.7K,p = pLCL = 760 mb, and w = wsw(TLCL)= 15 g kg−1, that θep ≈ 359 K. Evaluating the same equation at p′ = 600 mb gives 359 = T ′ ( 1000 p′ )0.285(1−0.28w′) × exp [ w′(1+0.81w′) ( 3376 TLCL − 2.54)] (7.86) where T ′,p ′, and w′ is the state of the air at the summit. In the above equation we know p′ but T ′ and w′ are unknowns. However, w′ can be expressed as a function of T ′ alone by combining equations (7.5) and (6.17): w′ = wsw(T ′) ≈ ϵesw(T ′) p′ = 6.11ϵ p′ exp (19.83 − 5417 T ′ ) . Thus, in eﬀect, equation (7.83) has only one unknown, T ′. Solving this equation numerically gives T ′ ≈ 279 K. It fol- lows that at the summit w′ ≈ 9.6g kg−1. From that point on the air descends adiabatically with the mixing ratio remaining constant (9.6g kg−1). From Poisson’s equation we then ﬁnd that at 830 mb,T ≈ 306 K. At this temperature wsw ≈ 38.5g kg−1 and at p = 830 mb the relative humid- ity is r =0.25. Thus the air on the leeward side is warmer and drier than that on the west side. Note that we assume 138 7 MOIST AIR that the parcel from 760 to 600 mb remains saturated with respect to liquid water. This is a safe assumption because TLCL = 288.7 K and the vertical distance between 760 and 600 mb in a standard atmosphere is about 1.5 km. So, we would expect that the temperature at the summit would be above 0 ◦C. (7.5) What is the maximum rate of precipitation when saturated air rises? Consider a saturated parcel of air rising. For simplicity, we assume that this parcel is a unit mass. As the parcel rises water vapor condenses. If we assume that all condensed products (rain or snow) fall out we can estimate the upper limit for the rate of precipitation. In order to achieve this we consider equation (7.54) that describes reversible saturated adiabatic processes, which we simplify by assuming that lv = constant and cpd + wtcw ≈ cpd. cpdd ln T − Rdd ln pd + lvd ( wsw T ) =0 or cpdd ln T − Rdd ln pd + lv dwsw T − lvwsw T 2 dT =0 or by multiplying all terms by T cpddT − TRdd ln pd + lvdwsw − lvwsw T dT =0 or (cpd − lvwsw T ) dT − pd ρ d ln pd + lvdwsw =0 or using the hydrostatic approximation (cpd − lvwsw T ) dT + gdz + lvdwsw =0. For typical conditions in the atmosphere lvwsw/T is very small compared to cpd. We can thus neglect it to arrive at cpddT + gdz + lvdwsw =0 or − lvdwsw dz = cpd dT dz + g or − lv cpd dwsw dz = dT dz + g cpd EXAMPLES 139 Now, recall that Γd = g cpd and that − dT dz = Γs. Thus, the above equation becomes − lv cpd dwsw dz = Γd − Γs or − dwsw dz = cpd(Γd − Γs) lv or − dwsw dt dt dz = cpd(Γd − Γs) lv where dz dt is the rate of ascent or speed of the parcel, U .It follows that − dwsw dt = cpd(Γd − Γs) lv U. The above equation gives the mass of condensed water per unit mass of air and unit time. If we multiply it by the mass of air, m, we can obtain an expression for the mass of water condensed and precipitated per unit time P = cpd(Γd − Γs) lv Um or P = cpd(Γd − Γs) lv UρV or P = cpd(Γd − Γs) lv UρAΔz where A is the area and Δz the thickness of the rising volume. Thus, per unit area and unit time P = cpd(Γd − Γs) lv UρΔz. In the above equation, P is given (in MKS units) in kg m−2 s−1. In practice, the amount of condensed water and precipitation per unit area is expressed by the depth of the collected water in millimeters (mm). Considering that the density is about 10 3 kg m−3, then 1 kg m −2 is equivalent to 1 mm of precipitated water. If, in addition, we consider that 1 h = 3600 s, then we can express the above equation in mm h−1, which is the unit for the rate of precipitation used in practice P = 3600 cpd(Γd − Γs) lv UρΔz. 140 7 MOIST AIR Problems (7.1) Show that when two air masses mix adiabatically and isobar- ically without condensation taking place, the ﬁnal potential temperature and ﬁnal vapor pressure are the weighted averages of the initial values (make necessary assumptions).

In this case, we can write that ρwdw = ∫ ∞ 0 ρvdz where ρw and ρv are the densities of liquid water and water vapor, respectively. Show that the upper limit for dw is given by dw ≈ T0es0 ρwlvΓ where Γ is the lapse rate, which is assumed to be constant, T0 is the surface temperature, and es0 is the saturation vapor pressure with respect to water at T0.

CHAPTER EIGHT Vertical stability in the atmosphere Over large scales the atmosphere is very nearly hydrostatic, which means that the pressure gradient force balances the force of gravity. Because the net force in the vertical is zero, the atmosphere over those scales exhibits slow vertical motions of constant speed, i.e. there is no upward acceleration of air. However, on smaller scales hydrostatic equilibrium may be invalidated. In this case, acceler- ated motion leads to convection which embraces many phenomena observed in the atmosphere, from the structure of planetary bound- ary layers to the dynamics of hurricanes. In this chapter we will investigate the conditions that allow such accelerating motions. In particular, we will examine the fate of a parcel at equilibrium with its environment when it is subjected to a small perturbation. We will make the following assumptions: (1) the environment is in hydrostatic equilibrium; (2) the parcel does not mix with its surroundings; (3) the parcel’s movement does not disturb the envi- ronment; (4) the process is adiabatic; and (5) at a given level the pressure of the environment and the pressure of the parcel are equal. In problem 8.1 you will be asked to elaborate on the validity of the above assumptions. 8.1 The equation of motion for a parcel Because the environment is in hydrostatic equilibrium the following equation holds: dp dz = −ρg. For the parcel, the above equation is not applicable because as the parcel is displaced (upwards or downwards) it has some acceleration (d2z/dt2). Assuming that gravity and the pressure gradient force 143 144 8 VERTICAL STABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE are acting on the parcel, Newton’s second law dictates that per unit volume (primes identify the parcel) ρ ′ d2z dt2 = −ρ ′g − dp′ dz or ¨z = −g − a ′ dp′ dz . Because of assumption (5) above, dp′/dz = dp/dz. Thus, the above equation can be written as ¨z = −g − a ′ (− g a ) or ¨z = g ( a ′ − a a ) or ¨z = g ( ρ − ρ′ ρ′ ) . (8.1) The right-hand side gives the force per unit mass acting on the parcel due to the combination of gravity and pressure gradient and is called the buoyancy of the parcel. Using the deﬁnition of virtual temperature and assumption (5), we can write the ideal gas law for both environment and parcel as: p = ρRdTvirt and p = ρ ′RdT ′ virt. (8.2) The reason for adopting these expressions rather than p = ρRT and p = ρ ′R′T ′ is that this way we deal with Tvirt and T ′ virt rather than R, R′,T , and T ′. This makes the analysis more straightforward. Combining equations (8.1) and (8.2) yields ¨z = g ( T ′ virt − Tvirt Tvirt ) . (8.3) What we are interested in here is to investigate the eﬀect on the motion, described by equation (8.3), of small displacements (z ≪ 1) from an original equilibrium level. If, for simplicity, we take this level to be the z = 0 level where the temperature is Tvirt,0 and express both Tvirt and T ′ virt in terms of Taylor’s series we get Tvirt = Tvirt,0 + dTvirt dz z + 1 2 d2Tvirt dz2 z2 + ··· and T ′ virt = Tvirt,0 + dT ′ virt dz z + 1 2 d2T ′ virt dz2 z2 + ··· 8.2 STABILITY ANALYSIS AND CONDITIONS 145 If we now neglect terms of order higher than the ﬁrst and deﬁne the environmental virtual temperature lapse rate as −dTvirt/dz = Γvirt and the parcel’s virtual temperature lapse rate as −dT ′ virt/dz = Γ ′ virt we arrive at ¨z = g(Γvirt − Γ ′ virt)z Tvirt,0 − Γvirtz . (8.4) In the above equation we can manipulate the term 1/(Tvirt,0−Γvirtz) to arrive at 1 Tvirt,0 − Γvirtz = 1 Tvirt,0 1 1 − Γvirtz Tvirt,0 ≈ 1 Tvirt,0 (1+ Γvirtz Tvirt,0 ) because Γvirtz Tvirt,0 ≪ 1. Then equation (8.4) becomes ¨z = g Tvirt,0 (1+ Γvirtz Tvirt,0 ) (Γvirt − Γ ′ virt) z or by eliminating terms involving z2 ¨z = g Tvirt,0 (Γvirt − Γ ′ virt) z or ¨z + g Tvirt,0 (Γ ′ virt − Γvirt) z =0. (8.5) 8.2 Stability analysis and conditions The solution of the diﬀerential equation (8.5) depends on the constants. Three possibilities exist. (1) Γ ′ virt − Γvirt > 0 In this case equation (8.5) takes the form ¨z + λ2z = 0 and has the solution z(t)= A sin λt + B cos λt where the oscillatory components are characterized by λ = √ g Tvirt,0 (Γ ′ virt − Γvirt) > 0. This is the so-called Brunt–V¨ais¨al¨a frequency. Since we assumed that the initial level is z = 0, it follows that in this case B = 0 and as such z(t)= A sin λt. This indicates that the parcel will oscillate in time about its original position with a period τ =2π/λ. This represents a stable case as the parcel does not leave the original level. 146 8 VERTICAL STABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE (2) Γ ′ virt − Γvirt < 0 In this case equation (8.5) takes the form ¨z − λ2z = 0 and has the solution z(t)= Ae λt + Be −λt where now λ = √ g Tvirt,0 (Γvirt − Γ ′ virt) > 0. Since at t =0,z(0) = 0 it follows that A+B = 0. This indicates that A = −B ̸= 0 (the possibility of A = B = 0 leads to the trivial solution z(t) = 0 which we ignore). Since A ̸=0 it then follows that as t →∞, a parcel’s displacement grows exponentially. Note that since for t →∞, dz/dt = Aλe λt, the parcel’s motion is an accelerating motion. This is the unstable situation where the parcel leaves the original level and never returns. (3) Γ ′ virt − Γvirt =0 In this case equation (8.5) becomes ¨z = 0 and has the linear solution z(t)= At + B indicating that the displacement grows linearly with time. The parcel’s motion is now one of a constant speed (dz/dt = A). This is the neutral case where the parcel leaves the original level and never returns. Thus, the only diﬀerence between neu- tral and unstable situations is whether or not the motion is an accelerating one. The physical meaning of the above is that as long as the parcel’s lapse rate is greater than that of the environment and the parcel is forced upwards (downwards), it will become colder (warmer) than the environment and it will sink (rise) back to the original level. If the parcel’s lapse rate is less than that of the environment and the parcel is forced upwards (downwards) it will become warmer (colder) than the environment and it will continue to rise (sink) thus moving away from the original level. The diﬀerence between the two lapse rates is the net force acting on the parcel. If the net force is zero the motion is one of a constant speed. Otherwise the net force acts in the direction of the initial impulse if Γ ′ virt−Γvirt < 0 or in the opposite direction if Γ ′ virt − Γvirt > 0. Let us now examine in detail what happens when a parcel is dis- placed in a layer, which is characterized by a virtual temperature lapse rate Γvirt. From equation (7.9) we have that for an unsatu- rated parcel T ′ virt = (1+0.61w′)T ′, where w′ is the initial mixing ratio, which because of assumption (2) remains constant. Thus, dT ′ virt dz = (1+0.61w′) dT ′ dz 8.2 STABILITY ANALYSIS AND CONDITIONS 147 or Γ ′ virt = (1+0.61w′)Γm or using equation (7.29) Γ ′ virt = (1+0.61w′)(1 − 0.87w′)Γd or Γ ′ virt ≈ (1 − 0.26w′)Γd. The term 0.26w′ in the above relation is rather small and therefore we may neglect it. Thus, for unsaturated parcels Γ ′ virt ≈ Γd. (8.6) Note that for the environment, w is not constant but a function of z. As such, for the environment we have dTvirt dz = (1+0.61w) dT dz +0.61T dw dz or Γvirt = (1+0.61w)Γ − 0.61T dw dz . (8.7) The second term on the right-hand side of equation (8.7) is not negligible and therefore we cannot arrive at a relation similar to equation (8.6) for Γvirt and Γ (the environmental lapse rate). This is why we have to use the virtual temperature in our stability analysis rather than the actual temperature. If Γvirt were approximately equal to Γ , then we could use T rather than Tvirt in our stability analysis. Because this is not the case, it is more appropriate to use virtual temperatures. We can then state the condition for stability for an unsaturated parcel in a layer with Γvirt as follows: if Γvirt >Γd layer is unstable, if Γvirt = Γd layer is neutral, if Γvirt <Γd layer is stable. (8.8) For saturated parcels the mixing ratio decreases with height. Proceeding as above we have T ′ virt = (1+0.61w′)T ′ or dT ′ virt dz = (1+0.61w′) dT ′ dz +0.61T ′ dw′ dz or Γ ′ virt = (1+0.61w′)Γs − 0.61T ′ dw′ dz . 148 8 VERTICAL STABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE Figure 8.1 Relative position of fundamental lines and regions of stability. Isotherm Saturated adiabat Γs Conditional stabilityDry adiabat Γd Absolute instability Isobar Absolute stability In this case the second term of the right-hand side is much smaller than the ﬁrst term. Thus, we can approximate the above equation as Γ ′ virt ≈ Γs. Accordingly, the condition for stability for a saturated parcel in a layer with Γvirt can be stated as if Γvirt >Γs layer is unstable, if Γvirt = Γs layer is neutral, if Γvirt <Γs layer is stable. (8.9) Since Γd =9.8 ◦Ckm−1 and Γs ≈ 5 ◦Ckm−1, conditions (8.8) and (8.9) can be combined in one as follows: if Γvirt >Γd layer is absolutely unstable, if Γs <Γvirt <Γd layer is conditionally unstable, if Γvirt <Γs layer is absolutely stable. (8.10) The word “absolutely” indicates that the stability criterion holds for any type (saturated or unsaturated) of parcel. The term “condi- tionally unstable” means that the layer is stable for displacement of unsaturated parcels and unstable for saturated parcels (Figure 8.1). Now recall that for unsaturated environments equation (7.28) applies: θvirt = Tvirt ( 1000 p )kd . Logarithmic diﬀerentiation of the above equation gives 1 θvirt dθvirt dz = 1 Tvirt dTvirt dz − kd p dp dz 8.2 STABILITY ANALYSIS AND CONDITIONS 149 or 1 θvirt dθvirt dz = − 1 Tvirt Γvirt − kd p (− p RdTvirt g) or 1 θvirt dθvirt dz = − Γvirt Tvirt + 1 Tvirt ( g cpd ) or 1 θvirt dθvirt dz = 1 Tvirt (Γd − Γvirt) . (8.11) Combining (8.8) with (8.11) yields an alternative way to express stability conditions for unsaturated parcels: if dθvirt dz > 0 layer is stable, if dθvirt dz = 0 layer is neutral, if dθvirt dz < 0 layer is unstable. (8.12) For a saturated parcel similar conditions can be applied if we substi- tute θvirt by θe (or in practice θep) which is invariant along saturated adiabats (or pseudoadiabats) if dθe dz > 0 layer is stable, if dθe dz = 0 layer is neutral, if dθe dz < 0 layer is unstable. (8.13) The above set of criteria applies to the stability as a parcel rises in a motionless layer. If this is not true (for example, when entire layers are lifted or lowered), then the stability of the layer may be aﬀected. Here is why it happens. Let us consider a stable layer in hydrostatic equilibrium whose bot- tom has a pressure p1 and whose top has a pressure p2. Let us further assume that the diﬀerence in pressure, Δp, between top and bottom remains constant during the lifting or sinking. If the whole process is an unsaturated adiabatic process, then equation (8.11) applies. Since in this process θvirt is conserved then the dif- ference in θvirt between top and bottom is conserved. It follows that 1 θvirt dθvirt dz = 1 θvirt dθvirt dp (−ρg)= 1 Tvirt (Γd − Γvirt) 150 8 VERTICAL STABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE or 1 θvirt dθvirt dp = − Rd pg (Γd − Γvirt) = constant or Rd(Γd − Γvirt) = constant × g × p. During lifting pressure decreases, and according to the above equa- tion Γvirt → Γd. Since the layer is initially stable this tendency will cause the layer’s lapse rate to approach the region of instability (recall Figure 8.1). During sinking the opposite is true. As such, lifting of a layer tends always to destabilize the layer and sinking of a layer tends always to stabilize the layer. If the lifting process is strong enough to cause the layer to saturate, then the picture is quite diﬀerent. In this case the stability changes depend on the way saturation is reached, which in turn depends on the vertical distribution of moisture and the vertical structure of temperature among other factors. For example, let us consider an initially stable unsaturated layer at level 1 in which the temperature proﬁle is BT and in which dθe/dp < 0 (i.e. the bottom of the layer has more moisture than the top of the layer). As Figure 8.2 illustrates when the layer is lifted, the bottom of the layer (B) and the top of the layer (T) Figure 8.2 Graphical representation of convective instability. p(mb) T T T T B B B Level 3 Level 2 Level 1 θ1 θ2 > θ1 8.2 STABILITY ANALYSIS AND CONDITIONS 151 will cool at the dry adiabatic rate (solid lines). However, the bot- tom will reach saturation sooner than the top. Thus, at level 2 the bottom will start cooling at the moist adiabatic rate (broken line) whereas the top will continue cooling at the dry adiabatic rate. Because of that, at position 3, independently of whether or not the top has reached saturation, the temperature proﬁle will be rotated to the left in relation to the initial proﬁle at level 1. This coun- terclockwise rotation causes an initially stable situation to become less stable (see Figure 8.1). Thus, when dθe/dp < 0 the initially stable unsaturated layer is potentially or convectively unstable. If in the same layer dθe/dz > 0 (i.e. the top has more moisture than the bottom), then the top will reach saturation ﬁrst and it will begin to cool at the moist rate while the bottom will continue cooling at the dry rate. In this case the initial temperature proﬁle BT turns clockwise (Figure 8.3), which means that the initially stable layer will tend to become even more stable. Thus, when dθe/dz > 0 the layer is potentially or convectively stable. If in the same layer dθe/dz = 0 (i.e. all levels of the layer have the same moisture), then both top and bottom will reach saturation along the same moist adiabat. In this case the initially stable layer is called potentiallly or convectively neutral. Figure 8.3 Graphical representation of convective stability. p(mb) T T T T B B B Level 3 Level 2 Level 1 θ1 θ2 > θ1 152 8 VERTICAL STABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE If the whole layer becomes saturated, the stability criteria for the layer translate to the following if dθe dz > 0 the saturated layer will be stable with respect to saturated parcel processes, if dθe dz = 0 the saturated layer will be neutral with respect to saturated parcel processes, if dθe dz < 0 the saturated layer will be unstable with respect to saturated parcel processes. (8.14) where dθe/dz refers to the initial proﬁle of θe (or in practice θep) in the layer, which initially is not saturated. In the atmosphere, a potentially unstable layer tends to form cumulus-type clouds and often convective precipitation. On the other hand, a poten- tially stable layer produces stratiform clouds with light (if any) precipitation. 8.3 Other factors affecting stability In our initial assumptions we accepted that the parcel does not mix with the environment, that the process is adiabatic, and that the environment is not disturbed (i.e. there are no compensating ver- tical motions in the environment as a parcel or a layer rises in it). When these assumptions are violated they aﬀect the temperature lapse rate of the parcel and so the stability criteria derived previ- ously do not apply. A detailed treatment of these subjects is beyond the scope of this book. Interested readers can consult Iribarne and Godson (1973). Examples (8.1) The table below provides pressure, temperature, and dew point temperature measurements at various pressure levels. (1) Inves- tigate the stability conditions of parcels rising in each layer. (2) If each layer were lifted en masse until it became saturated would it become convectively stable, neutral, or unstable? (Assume that lv is independent of T and equal to 2.45 × 106 J kg–1.) First, we need to establish whether or not at a given level the parcels are saturated. The temperature is at all levels greater than the dew point temperature except at 850 mb. Accordingly, for the stability of the parcels, conditions (8.12) apply for all layers except for the layer 850–800 mb. EXAMPLES 153 pT Tdew (mb) ( oC) ( oC) 1000 30 23 950 27 21 900 23 20 850 20 20 800 18 10 750 15 5 700 10 2 650 5 0 For the layer 850–800 mb, conditions (8.13) apply. For the convective stability of each layer conditions (8.14) apply. Thus, in order to answer the questions we need to calcu- late θvirt and θep at each level. In order to estimate θvirt and θep (recall equations (7.28) and (7.63)) we need to ﬁnd at each level w and TLCL. The mixing ratio can be estimated by combining equations (7.3), (7.7), (7.16), and (6.17). TLCL can be estimated from equation (7.36). After plenty of calculations we arrive at the following table; here es is in mb. pT Tdew wTvirt θvirt θep res TLCL 1000 303 296 0.0182 306.4 306.4 357.4 0.66 43.1 294.3 Layer 1 950 300 294 0.0169 303.0 307.5 355.1 0.70 36.0 292.6 Layer 2 900 296 293 0.0166 299.0 308.1 355.0 0.83 28.2 292.3 Layer 3 850 293 293 0.0176 296.1 310.2 360.2 1.00 23.4 293.0 Layer 4 800 291 283 0.0099 292.8 312.1 340.1 0.61 20.6 281.3 Layer 5 750 288 278 0.0149 290.6 315.5 361.7 0.51 17.0 276.0 Layer 6 700 283 275 0.0063 284.1 314.6 333.3 0.58 12.2 273.4 Layer 7 650 278 273 0.0058 279.0 315.6 332.9 0.70 8.6 272.0 (1) According to the results in the above table and condi- tions (8.12) and (8.13), we ﬁnd that for parcels rising in each of the layers, layer 1 is stable (dθvirt/dz > 0), layer 2 is stable (dθvirt/dz > 0), layer 3 is stable 154 8 VERTICAL STABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE (dθvirt/dz > 0), layer 4 is unstable (dθep/dz < 0), layer 5 is stable (dθvirt/dz > 0), layer 6 is unstable (dθvirt/dz < 0), and layer 7 is stable (dθvirt/dz > 0). (2) Similarly, we ﬁnd that layer 1 is convectively unstable (dθep/dz < 0), layer 2 is convectively neutral (dθep/ dz ≈ 0), layer 3 is convectively stable (dθep/dz > 0), layer 4 is convectively unstable, (dθep/dz < 0), layer 5 is convectively stable (dθep/dz > 0), layer 6 is convectively unstable (dθep/dz < 0), and layer 7 is approximately convectively neutral (dθep/dz ≈ 0). (8.2) In an atmospheric layer the virtual temperature is constant and equal to 10 oC. If an initial fluctuation causes the parcel to rise adiabatically, calculate the energy per unit mass that has to be given to the parcel in order for it to rise 1 km above the bottom of the layer before it begins to sink. When a parcel rises in the atmosphere, a certain amount of work is performed by or against the buoyancy force depend- ing on whether the motion is along or against the direction of the buoyancy force. If the buoyancy force is directed downwards (negative buoyancy) a certain amount of work is done against buoyancy and if the buoyancy force is directed upwards (positive buoyancy) a certain amount of work is done by the buoyancy force. In the above problem since the layer is isothermal the layer is stable. Thus, the buoyancy on the parcel is negative and a parcel forced to rise will have to return to the initial level. But before it begins its return, it will reach a maximum height which depends on how strong the initial impulse was. Recall from Chapter 4 that δW = Fdz = madz = m¨zdz. Thus, the work done, W , when a parcel is forced to rise from a level i to a level f is W = ∫ f i m¨zdz. (8.15) Using equation (8.3), the above equation becomes W = ∫ f i mg [ T ′ virt(z) − Tvirt(z) Tvirt(z) ] dz (8.16) or W = gm ∫ f i T ′ virt(z) Tvirt(z) dz − gm ∫ f i dz PROBLEMS 155 or, assuming that the ascent is dry adiabatic, W = gm ∫ f i (Tvirt,0 − Γdz) Tvirt(z) dz − gm(f − i). Since Tvirt(z)= Tvirt,0 and assuming that the bottom of the layerisat z = 0 (i.e. i = 0 m and f = 1000 m), we ﬁnd that the work done per unit mass is equal to −169.7Jkg −1, i.e. work is done against the buoyancy force. Since the ascent is assumed to be adiabatic, δQ = 0. Then from the ﬁrst law we obtain du = 169.7Jkg−1. This is the amount of energy per unit mass that must be given to the parcel for the above process to take place. Note that using the hydrostatic approximation, equation (8.16) can be expressed as W = ∫ f i − m ρ ( T ′ virt − Tvirt Tvirt ) dp or using p = ρRdTvirt W = −Rdm ∫ f i (T ′ virt − Tvirt) dp p or W = −Rdm ∫ f i (T ′ virt − Tvirt)d ln p. (8.17) Ina(T − lnp) diagram the above equation is proportional to the area enclosed between the vertical proﬁle of the environment and the vertical proﬁle of the parcel’s virtual temperature. Equation (8.16) or (8.17) gives the maximum work done by the buoyancy and when divided by the total mass deﬁnes (remember we are always dealing with adia- batic processes, i.e. δQ = 0) what is called the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the convective inhi- bition energy (CINE). More on CAPE and CINE and their applications will be discussed in the next chapter. Problems (8.1) Elaborate on the ﬁve assumptions made in derivation of the stability conditions of a parcel that is subject to a small displacement from equilibrium. 156 8 VERTICAL STABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE (8.2) If the virtual temperature proﬁle in a layer is Tvirt (z)= Tvirt,0a/(a + z), where a> 0 and Tvirt,0 >aΓd, derive the vertical proﬁle of the virtual potential temperature. What is the condition for stability for unsaturated parcels in this layer? (Unstable for z< zc, stable for z> zc, and neutral for z = zc, where zc = √ (aTvirt,0/Γd) − a) (8.3) If the proﬁle of virtual potential temperature in a layer is θvirt θvirt,0 = e z a1 − z a2 , what is the condition for stability in the layer for unsaturated parcels? (Stable when z> a1 ln(a1/a2), unstable when z< a1 ln(a1/a2)) (8.4) An atmospheric layer is isothermal. A dry parcel is sub- jected to an upward displacement and begins to oscillate about its original level. Plot the oscillation period as a function of the temperature of the layer. What do you observe? (8.5) If we deﬁne the geopotential φ according to dφ = gdz with φ(0) = 0 show that under hydrostatic conditions Δz = ( Rd g ln p1 p2 ) T virt, where Δz is the thickness of a layer bounded by p1 and p2 (p1 >p2) and T virt is the mean virtual temperature of the layer. Using the above relationship show that if a layer is lifted en masse while the mean virtual tem- perature remains constant, then the upper level pressure change, dp2, is related to the lower level change, dp1, via the equation dp1 p1 = dp2 p2 . (8.6) Show that for a constant virtual temperature lapse rate atmosphere (Tvirt(z)= Tvirt − Γvirtz) p = p0 [ 1 − Γvirtz Tvirt,0 ]g/RdΓvirt . (8.7) Show that for an atmosphere where Tvirt(z)= Tvirt,0 p = p0e −gz/RdTvirt,0 (8.8) From the following data determine the stability and convec- tive stability of each layer.

A parcel of air at the surface is given an initial velocity of 1 m s −1. If the virtual temperature at the surface is 7 ◦C, and assuming that the parcel is and remains dry, ﬁnd its position and velocity after 1 min. (81 m, 2.1ms−1) (8.10) Sea-breezes and lake-breezes are established when the air over the land becomes warmer than the air over the water. The warmer air over land rises thus destroying the pressure stratiﬁcation and resulting in horizontal pressure gradients between land and water. The height of the breeze is the altitude where the horizontal pressure gradient vanishes. Assuming that the vertical virtual temperature proﬁles over land and water are isothermal and the same, show that this height is given by h = Rd ln(pw/pl) g( 1 Tvirt,w − 1 Tvirt,l ) where the subscripts l and w denote the conditions over land and water, respectively. (8.11) Consider problems 8.6, 8.7, and 8.10. How would the results change if these problems were stated in terms of the tem- perature proﬁles rather than virtual temperature proﬁles? CHAPTER NINE Thermodynamic diagrams Chapters 1 to 6 laid down the fundamental physical and mathemat- ical concepts pertaining to thermodynamics. While we always kept the discussion close to our atmosphere, it was not until Chapter 7 that, in a more applied mood, we presented how these concepts are applied to yield quantities useful to atmospheric processes. However, even if we understand all the mathematics, we still need an eﬃcient way to present and visualize thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere. Thermodynamic diagrams can do that. Up to this point we made an eﬀort to visualize the thermodynamic pro- cess using a (p, V )ora(p, T ) diagram. However, such diagrams, while simple, may not be very convenient when it comes to their utilization. Since the purpose of a diagram is eﬃciently and clearly to display processes and estimate thermodynamic quantities, the following are very desirable in a thermodynamic diagram: (1) for every cyclic process the area should be proportional to work done or energy (area-equivalent transformations), (2) lines should be straight (easy to use), and (3) the angle between adiabats and isotherms should be as large as possible (easy to distinguish). The (p, V ) diagram satisﬁes the ﬁrst condition (pda = dw), but the angle between isotherms and adiabats is not very large (Figure 4.5(a)). Because of this, while it is used for illustration purposes, this diagram is not used in practice. 9.1 Conditions for area-equivalent transformations When we are constructing a new diagram, in eﬀect, we go from the x = a, y = −p domain to a new domain characterized by two new coordinates, say u and w. These two coordinate systems are shown in Figure 9.1. If we want the ﬁrst condition to be satisﬁed then an 159 160 9 THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS Figure 9.1 Area-equivalent transformations. y = –p x = a dx dA w u du dA'dwdy area dA = | −→ dx × −→ dy | in the x, y domain is mapped onto an area dA′ = | −→ du × −→ dw | in the u, w domain, such that dA = ζdA ′ (× here is the cross product between two vectors and ζ> 0 is a constant). Since any pair of points x and y are transformed to u and w we have that x = x(u, w) and y = y(u, w). We can thus write −→ dx= ∂x ∂u −→ du + ∂x ∂w −→ dw −→ dy = ∂y ∂u −→ du + ∂y ∂w −→ dw . Then dA = ( ∂x ∂u ∂y ∂w − ∂x ∂w ∂y ∂u ) ∣ ∣ ∣ −→ du × −→ dw∣ ∣ ∣ , (9.1) where we have used the facts that −→ du × −→ du = −→ dw × −→ dw=0 and −→ du × −→ dw = − −→ dw × −→ du . In equation (9.1) | −→ du × −→ dw | = dA′. Thus, dA = ζdA ′ (9.2) where ζ = J = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∂x ∂u ∂x ∂w ∂y ∂u ∂y ∂w ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation. It follows that the condition for area-equivalence is that the Jacobian should be a constant (if J = 1, then this is an equal-area transformation). The above approach tells us whether or not the two new coordinates provide an area-equivalent transformation, but both u and w must 9.2 EXAMPLES OF THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS 161 be speciﬁed. If only one is speciﬁed, then the following approach provides the other one. Since dA = ζdA ′ it follows that ∮ ydx = ∮ −pda = ζ ∮ wdu or ∮ (pda + ζwdu)=0. The above condition is true if pda + ζwdu = dz is an exact diﬀerential. Thus, z = f (a, u) and dz(a, u)= ( ∂z ∂a ) u da + ( ∂z ∂u ) a du. It follows that the suﬃcient conditions for an area-equivalent transformation are p = ( ∂z ∂a ) u and ζw = ( ∂z ∂u ) a . From the above two equations we have ( ∂p ∂u ) a = ∂2z ∂a∂u and ζ ( ∂w ∂a ) u = ∂2z ∂a∂u . Thus, if ζ ( ∂w ∂a ) u = ( ∂p ∂u ) a (9.3) then the areas will be equivalent (again here if ζ = 1 the areas will be equal). From equation (9.3) if we specify u we can determine what w should be in order for the transformation to be an area- equivalent transformation. 9.2 Examples of thermodynamic diagrams 9.2.1 The tephigram If we suppose that u = T then ( ∂p ∂u ) a = ( ∂p ∂T ) a . 162 9 THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS Using the ideal gas law, the above leads to ( ∂p ∂u ) a = R a . From equation (9.3) we then have ζ ( ∂w ∂a ) T = R a or ζ ( ∂w ∂a ) T da = R a da or after integrating ζw = R ln a + f (T ) (9.4) where f (T ) is the constant of integration which we can choose. By manipulating Poisson’s equation we can write T θ = ( RT 1000a )k or ln a = 1 k (ln θ − ln T )+ln T +ln R − ln 1000 or R ln a = cp ln θ + f ′(T ). If we combine the above equation with equation (9.4) and choose f (T )= −f ′(T ) and ζ = cp, we arrive at an area-equivalent diagram with coordinates w =ln θ (9.5) u = T. Obviously, in this diagram the dry adiabats are straight lines and perpendicular to the isotherms (Figure 9.2). The equation for the isobars can be derived from Poisson’s equation for p = constant: ln θ =ln T + constant. In a coordinate system (ln θ, T ) the above equation describes loga- rithmic curves. As expected, the work done on a unit mass of air in a reversible cycle (−q) is proportional to the cycle: −q = − ∮ Tds = −cp ∮ Td ln θ = −cpAteph where Ateph is the area of the cycle in the tephigram ∗ (positive if described counterclockwise). If the air is dry, cp = cpd. ∗ The word “tephigram” originated from the coordinates of this diagram, which are T and entropy. Entropy was originally denoted as φ (phi), but is now denoted by S. 9.2 EXAMPLES OF THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS 163 Figure 9.2 Isobars, isotherms, and dry adiabats on a tephigram. Also shown is the ws =10 g kg−1 saturation mixing ratio line (solid bold line) and the pseudo-adiabat θe =40 ◦C (broken line).–40°T = –20 °C 60 ° 40 ° θ = 20 °C 0°0°20°Pressure (hPa) 400 600 800 1000 9.2.2 The emagram Let us assume again that u = T . By taking the logarithm of the equation of state we get ln a = − ln p +ln R +ln T. Combining this equation with equation (9.4) yields w = −ζ −1R ln p + ζ −1[R ln R + R ln T + f (T )]. If we now choose f (T )= −R ln R − R ln T and ζ = R, we arrive at the area-equivalent diagram with coordinates w = − ln p (9.6) u = T. In this diagram (which is called an emagram – Energy per unit MAss diaGRAM) the isobars are parallel straight lines and per- pendicular to the isotherms. The dry adiabats are again derived from Poisson’s equation ln θ =ln T + kd ln 1000 − kd ln p or − ln p = − 1 kd ln T + constant. 164 9 THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS Figure 9.3 Same as Figure 9.2 but for an emagram. θ = 20 °C 0° –20° 40 ° 60 ° 80 ° 100° 120°Pressure (hPa) 400 600 800 1000 Temperature (°C) –40 –20 0 20 40 Since the coordinates are ln p and T , the above equation is not a straight line. In the emagram the dry adiabats are slightly curved lines (Figure 9.3). Their angle with the isotherms is about 45 ◦. Here, again, the work done on a unit mass of air in a reversible cycle (− ∮ pda) is proportional to the area of the cycle: − ∮ pda = ∮ [−d(pa)+ adp] = ∮ [−RdT + adp] = − ∮ RdT + ∮ adp = ∮ adp = ∮ RT dp p = −R ∮ Td(− ln p) = −RAem where Aem is the area in the emagram enclosed by the cycle, which is positive if described counterclockwise. If the air is dry, R = Rd. 9.2 EXAMPLES OF THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS 165 9.2.3 The skew emagram (skew (T –ln p) diagram) Let us now assume that u = − ln p. Then ζ ( ∂w ∂a ) ln p = − ( ∂p ∂ ln p ) a or ζ ( ∂w ∂a ) ln p = −p or ζ ( ∂w ∂a ) ln p da = −pda. Integrating for p = constant yields ζw = −pa + F (ln p) or ζw = −RT + F (ln p). We may choose F (ln p)= −ξ ln p where ξ is a constant. Then ζw = −RT − ξ ln p. If we choose ζ = R, we arrive at a new diagram with coordinates w = −T − ξ/R ln p u = − ln p. Since the sign of an area in a diagram involves only the direction in which a cycle is carried out, the new coordinate system can be written as w = T + ξ R ln p (9.7) u = − ln p. This represents a correction (in fact a rotation) to the emagram which provides larger angles between any adiabats and isotherms (Figure 9.4). An isotherm in this diagram has the equation w = constant + ξ R ln p or w = constant − ξ R u. In the (u, w) domain this equation represents a straight line with a slope equal to ξ/R. Thus, we may choose a ξ for which the isotherms are perpendicular to the dry adiabats. Note that the equation for dry adiabats is not linear. From Poisson’s equation we have that ln θ =ln T + kd ln 1000 − kd ln p or ln p =(1/kd)ln T + constant. 166 9 THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS Figure 9.4 Same as figure 9.2 but for a skew (T –ln p) diagram.Pressure (hPa) –4 0° 20° 0° 0° 20° θ = 40 °C 60 ° T = –20 °C 400 600 800 1000 While here ln p is a coordinate, ln T is not and so the dry adiabats are not exactly straight lines. Here again it is easy to show that the work done in a cyclic process is proportional to the area of the cycle. The skew emagram and tephigram are the most commonly used diagrams. Other diagrams have been proposed (see problems 9.1–9.3), but their practical use is limited. A detailed skew T –ln p diagram is supplied at the end of the book (Figure A.1). For a complete description of a thermodynamic process in a dia- gram, in addition to isotherms, isobars, and adiabats, we also need to deﬁne the constant mixing ratio lines and the saturated adiabats (see also Chapter 7). From the deﬁnition of mixing ratio we have p = esw(T )+ ϵesw(T ) wsw or p ≈ ϵesw(T ) wsw . (9.8) For a constant wsw the above equation deﬁnes a family of curves, which in the (T, ln p) domain are approximately (but not quite) straight lines: p ≈ 6.11ϵ wsw exp (19.83 − 5417 T ) or ln p ≈ ln 6.11ϵ wsw +19.83 − 5417 T 9.3 THERMODYNAMIC VARIABLES IN A DIAGRAM 167 or ln p ≈ A + B T where A =ln (6.11ϵ/wsw)+19.83 and B = −5417. The above equation for typical values of wsw and T is nearly a straight line. Since w = wsw(Tdew,p), the dew point of unsaturated air deﬁnes the mixing ratio w at (T, p). It follows that the mixing ratio at (T, p) deﬁnes the dew point temperature. The saturated adiabats are determined numerically from equation (7.63). They can be labeled in terms of the estimated θep or in terms of the related (through equation (7.64)) θwp. 9.3 Graphical representation of thermodynamic variables in a T −ln p diagram Figure 9.5 shows the graphical procedure to obtain all the ther- modynamic variables derived analytically in Chapter 7, for a skew T –ln p diagram. We start with the state (T, p) where the air is assumed to be unsaturated and to have a mixing ratio w. The intersection between the w = constant line and the temperature axis gives the dew point temperature. By following the dry adiabat passing through point (T, p) (line a1) down to 1000 mb we obtain the potential temperature θ. By following it up until we intersect the w = constant line we arrive at the lifting condensation level (pLCL), where the parcel ﬁrst becomes saturated and has a temper- ature TLCL. Through point (TLCL,pLCL) passes a pseudo-adiabat s Figure 9.5 Graphical procedure to obtain thermodynamic variables, from a skew (T –ln p) diagram, given an initial state (T, p). 200 mb 1000 mb p DRY ADIABAT a1 DRY ADIABAT a2 PSEUDO-ADIABAT s PLCL TLCL Tdew Twp Tep θwp θ θep T w = CONSTANT 168 9 THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS deﬁned by θep. If we follow this pseudo-adiabat down to the original level p, we obtain the pseudo-wet-bulb temperature, Twp, and con- tinuing down to the 1000 mb level we obtain the pseudo-wet-bulb potential temperature, θwp (this also indicates the one-to-one rela- tionship between θwp and θep hence the labeling of pseudo-adiabats in terms of either θep or θwp). If we follow the pseudo-adiabat s up to a pressure level where we can assume that all vapor has con- densed and has fallen out of the parcel (typically this level is taken to be the 200 mb level), and then follow the dry adiabat passing through that point (line a2) down to the original level we obtain the pseudo-equivalent temperature, Tep. Continuing down to the 1000 mb level yields the pseudo-equivalent potential temperature, θep. Note that Tei,Tw,θw and θe are not directly estimated in dia- grams. As we discussed in Chapter 7, even though they are very close to each other, in actuality Tei ̸= Tep, Tw ̸= Twp, θw ̸= θwp, and θei ̸= θep (recall equation (7.66)). 9.3.1 Using diagrams in forecasting Figure 9.6 shows in a skew T –ln p diagram a sounding taken at Davenport, IA, on 21 June 1997 at 0000 utc. The solid line is the vertical proﬁle of environmental temperature and the heavy broken Figure 9.6 Sounding at Davenport, IA, on 21 June 1997 at 0000 utc. As explained in the text, the information provided by this diagram would not support the development of deep convection that day. Nevertheless, deep convection did occur later in the day and very severe weather resulted in parts of the Midwest. See text for details. 150 200 300Pressure (hPa) 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 –40 –30 –20 –10 0 Temperature (°C) A (LFC) LCL B (LNB) 10 20 30 9.3 THERMODYNAMIC VARIABLES IN A DIAGRAM 169 line to its left is the vertical proﬁle of dew point temperature. The parcels at the surface are unsaturated. The lifting condensation level of these parcels is about 860 mb where TLCL =20 ◦C. Above the LCL the light broken line is the pseudo-adiabat passing through the point (TLCL,pLCL) and below the LCL the light broken line is the dry adiabat passing through point (T, p) at the surface. The pseudo- adiabat intersects the temperature proﬁle at point A. Up to this point the parcel is colder than the environment. As such the layer from surface to point A is stable. This means that the buoyancy in this layer is negative and that work must be done against the buoyancy if parcels originating at the surface are to reach that level. The work needed is proportional to the darker shaded area (negative area). This work or the magnitude of this negative area is often called the convective inhibition energy (CINE) given by equation (8.17) for i = psurface and f = pA (here and in practice we make no distinction between T and Tvirt). CINE = R ∫ pA psurface(T ′ − T )d ln p. In our example, psurface ≈ 980 mb and pA ≈ 740 mb. Assuming that the average T ′ − T in this layer is about −0.8 ◦C and that R ≈ Rd, we ﬁnd that CINE ≈ 64Jkg−1. If we now recall equation (8.15) we have that CINE = ∫ pA psurface dv dt vdt = 1 2 v2 A − 1 2 v2 surface where v is the vertical velocity. Assuming that vA ≈ 0 it follows that if a parcel that originated at the surface were to reach point A, the minimum initial impulse has to be vmin = √2 CINE ≈ 11.4ms−1. Therefore, unless an initial impulse of 11.4 m s −1 is applied to the parcels they will not make it to point A. This point is called the level of free convection (LFC). Above this level the parcel is warmer than the environment all the way up to 150 mb. The buoyancy from LFC to 150 mb is positive and now work is done by buoyancy. This work is proportional to the lighter shaded area (positive area). In this layer the parcels that made it to LFC are now free to rise and accelerate. Note that owing to the temperature inversion in the stratosphere, above 150 mb the temperature normally increases with height. As such, there is a point (B in our example) where the temperatures of the parcel and the environment become equal again. Above this level, which is referred to as the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), work is done against buoyancy and the parcels 170 9 THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS begin to decelerate. The magnitude of the positive area is called the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and is given by CAPE = −R ∫ LNB LFC (T ′ − T )d ln p. Assuming that between LFC and LNB the average diﬀerence between the temperature of the parcels and the environment is about 7 ◦C and that R ≈ Rd we can estimate that CAPE ≈ 3200 J kg−1. As we did above, we can show that in this case the maximum velocity a parcel will attain is vmax = √2 CAPE ≈ 80ms−1. Both CINE and CAPE are very useful as they provide information on whether or not convection will occur (CINE) and on how severe a storm might become (CAPE). In our example CAPE is rather high. Thus, if the parcels make it to LFC, they will then accelerate greatly and deep convection will ensue. The problem in predicting deep convection in this particular example, however, is that the value of CINE is considerable. Such values may inhibit development of convection. In practice, situa- tions of high CAPE values should be monitored to see whether the negative area is removed by warming of the air in the lower levels, or whether upward acceleration is aided by a low level jet or fron- togenesis. In our case all of the above happened thereby allowing deep convection and severe weather to develop later in the day in the Midwest. Together with CAPE and CINE we may calculate the precipitable water from soundings. If we recall the deﬁnition of precipitable water in problem 7.19 and the deﬁnition of speciﬁc humidity in equation (7.2) we have dw = 1 ρw ∫ ∞ 0 qρdz or using the hydrostatic approximation dw = 1 gρw ∫ psurface 0 qdp. The above equation indicates that precipitable water can be esti- mated by integrating the speciﬁc humidity proﬁle. The speciﬁc humidity proﬁle as a function of pressure can be obtained from the vertical proﬁles of T and Td using the equations presented in Chapter 7. Example (9.1) An air parcel at 1000 mb has a temperature of 20 oC and a mixing ratio of 10 g kg–1. The parcel is lifted to 700 mb by passing PROBLEMS 171 over a mountain. During the ascent 80% of the water vapor that condenses falls out of the parcel. Find the temperature and potential temperature of the air when it returns to 1000 mb on the other side of the mountain. The parcel is located at the point with coordinates T = 20 ◦C and p = 1000 mb (w =10 g kg−1). At this point, the saturation mixing ratio is ∼ 16 g kg−1. Therefore, the parcel is unsaturated and as it begins to rise it will fol- low the dry adiabat at that point (which because we are at 1000 mb is 20 ◦C). The point at which this dry adia- bat intersects the w =10 g kg−1 line is at p = 910 mb and T = TLCL ≈ 12.4 ◦C. This is the lifting condensation level and from that point on the parcel will follow the correspond- ing pseudo-adiabat (θep =49.5 ◦C, which in the skew T –ln p diagram is labeled in terms of the related θwp =16.5 ◦C). At 700 mb the saturation mixing ratio is ∼ 6.66 g kg−1. Therefore, 10 − 6.66 = 3.34 g of vapor per kg of dry air have condensed during the saturated ascent from 910 mb to 700 mb. Since 80% of this amount is removed by precipi- tation, it follows that 0.668 g kg−1 of liquid water remains in the parcel as it begins its descent. This means that ini- tially the descent will be dictated by the same saturated adiabat until all the water evaporates, i.e. until the mixing ratio increases from 6.66 to 6.66+0.668=7.328 g kg−1. This will happen at the point where the pseudo-adiabat inter- sects the w =7.328 line. This is the point with coordinates p ≈ 750 mb and T ≈ 4 ◦C. From this point on, the descent is dictated by the corresponding dry adiabat (θ ≈ 28 ◦C). Thus, on the other side of the mountain at p = 1000 mb, T = θ =28 ◦C. Problems (9.1) Show that the Refsdal diagram with coordinates u =ln T , w = −T ln p is an area-equivalent diagram and that neither its isobars nor its dry adiabats are straight lines. (9.2) Show that the St¨uve (or pseudo-adiabatic) diagram with coordinates u = T, w = −pkd is not an area-equivalent dia- gram. Show that isobars, isotherms, and dry adiabats are all straight lines. (9.3) Using the Jacobian method show that the diagram with coordinates u = T, w = cp ln θ is an equal-area diagram. (9.4) Given the sounding shown in the table, 172 9 THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS p(mb) T ( ◦C) 950 22.5 900 18.0 850 15.0 800 16.0 750 12.0 700 7.0 650 4.0 600 −1.5 500 −10.0 400 −20.0 determine using a diagram (1) the mixing ratio, (2) the relative humidity, (3) the potential temperature, (4) the pseudo-wet-bulb temperature, (5) the pseudo-wet-bulb potential temperature.

(9.6) Consider the following scenario (Figure 9.7). On a given day, onaskew T –ln p diagram the temperature proﬁle from the surface (1000 mb) to 200 mb has a constant lapse rate of 7 ◦Ckm−1. Above 200 mb the temperature is constant. If the parcels at the surface are saturated, what will the maximum vertical velocity be on that day assuming that the saturated adiabatic ascent can be approximated by the constant lapse rate of 6.5 ◦Ckm−1? The temperature at the surface is 30 ◦C. Assume R = Rd (∼ 54ms−1). (9.7) A parcel of air with an initial temperature of 15 ◦C and dew point 0 ◦C is lifted adiabatically from 1000 mb. Determine the lifting condensation level and temperature at that level.

(∼ 800 mb, ≈−3 ◦C, ∼−22 ◦C, ∼ 2.7g kg−1) (9.8) In the previous problem if all the condensed water falls as precipitation, can you roughly estimate the height of water collected on a rain collector of area 1 m2? Here you have to make your own assumptions. How does this result compare with the result obtained using the formula in problem 7.19? Can you explain any diﬀerences? (9.9) An air parcel at 900 mb has a temperature of 10 ◦C and a mixing ratio of 5 g kg−1. The parcel is then lifted to 700 mb by passing a mountain. If in this process 70% of the con- densed water is removed by precipitation, what will its temperature, potential temperature, and pseudo-wet-bulb potential temperature be when it returns to its initial level of 900 mb on the other side of the mountain? (∼ 14 ◦C, ∼ 23.5 ◦C, ∼ 11 ◦C) (9.10) If a temperature proﬁle in ◦C could be described as T (z)= 28 − 8z for z ≥ 1 km and T =20 ◦C for z< 1 km, and the mixing ratio at the surface is 16 g kg−1, estimate using a diagram the level of free convection. (∼ 2.4 km) CHAPTER TEN Beyond this book The previous chapters have presented the basics in atmospheric thermodynamics. As we know, in atmospheric sciences the ulti- mate goal is to predict as accurately as possible the changes in weather and climate. Thermodynamic processes are crucial in pre- dicting changes in weather patterns. For example, during cloud and precipitation formation vast amounts of heat are exchanged with the environment that aﬀect the atmosphere at many diﬀerent spa- tial scales. In this ﬁnal chapter we will present the basic concepts behind predicting weather changes. This chapter is not meant to treat the issue thoroughly, but only to oﬀer a glimpse of what comes next. 10.1 Basic predictive equations in the atmosphere In the Newtonian framework the state of the system is described exactly by the position and velocity of all its constituents. In the thermodynamical framework the state is deﬁned by the tempera- ture, pressure, and density of all its constituents. In a dynamical system such as the climate system both frameworks apply. Accord- ingly, a starting point in describing such a system will be to seek a set of equations that combine both the mechanical motion and thermodynamical evolution of the system. The fundamental equations that govern the motion and evolution of the atmosphere (and for that matter of the oceans and sea ice) are derived from the three basic conservation laws: the conserva- tion of momentum, the conservation of mass, and the conservation of energy. For the atmosphere the equation of state relates temper- ature, density, and pressure. In summary, from the conservation of momentum we derive the following set of predictive equations of motion (Washington and Parkinson (1986)) 175 176 10 BEYOND THIS BOOK du dt − (f + u tan φ a ) v = − 1 a cos φ 1 ρ ∂p ∂λ + Fλ (10.1) dv dt + (f + u tan φ a ) u = − 1 ρa ∂p ∂φ + Fφ (10.2) dω dt = − 1 ρ ∂p ∂z − g + Fz (10.3) with d dt = ∂ ∂t + u a cos φ ∂ ∂λ + v a ∂ ∂φ + ω ∂ ∂z u = a cos φ dλ dt v = a dφ dt ω = dz dt where u, v, and ω are the horizontal and vertical components of the motion, φ is the latitude, λ is the longitude, a is the radius of the earth, f is the Coriolis force, and F is the friction force. In the above equations the forces that drive the motion are the local pressure gradients, gravity, Coriolis, and friction. Equation (10.3) can be approximated by the hydrostatic equation (by assuming that dω/dt = 0 and Fz =0) g = − 1 ρ ∂p ∂z (10.4) which relates density to pressure. From the law of conservation of mass we can derive the continuity equation ∂ρ ∂t = − 1 a cos φ [ ∂ ∂λ (ρu)+ ∂ ∂φ (ρv cos φ) ] − ∂ ∂z (ρω) (10.5) which provides a predictive equation for density. The last two equa- tions in this basic formulation come from thermodynamics. The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics (which expresses the law of conservation of energy) Cp dT dt − 1 ρ dp dt = dQ dt , (10.6) where dQ/dt is the net heat gain, provides a predictive equation for temperature. The above equations (10.1, 10.2, 10.3 (or 10.4), 10.2 MOISTURE 177 10.5, and 10.6) make a system of ﬁve equations with six unknowns (u, v, ω, p, ρ, T ). The equation of state p = ρRT (10.7) provides the additional equation that connects pressure, density, and temperature, thus resulting in a system of six equations (called the primitive equations system), with six unknowns (assuming of course that dQ/dt, Fλ, and Fφ are constants and known). Note, however, that this system is not a closed one because dQ/dt, Fλ, and Fφ must be determined from the other variables. These terms are very important for climate simulations but for short-term weather prediction they are often ignored. 10.2 Moisture The above system of predictive equations was derived without the inclusion of moisture. Even though a model can be derived without moisture in it, including moisture can dramatically improve mod- eling and prediction. In a manner analogous to the continuity of mass, the changes of moisture must be balanced by the moisture’s sources and sinks. An equation of continuity for water vapor mixing ratio can be written as dw dt = 1 ρ M + E (10.8) where M is the time rate of change of water vapor per unit volume due to condensation or freezing, E is the time rate of change of water vapor per unit mass due to evaporation from the surface and to horizontal and vertical diﬀusion of moisture occurring on scales below the resolution of the model, and w is the mixing ratio. Often the above equation is combined with equation (10.5) to obtain ∂(ρω) ∂t + 1 a cos φ [ ∂ ∂λ (ρωu)+ ∂ ∂φ (ρωv cos φ) ] + ∂ ∂z (ρωw)= M +ρE. (10.9) When water vapor changes to water (or ice) and vice versa, heat is added to or removed from the atmospheric system. In this case dQ = d(lws/T ). The above general and simple equations constitute only the start- ing point for studying and investigating the fascinating dynamics of atmospheric motion. The equations have to be modiﬁed and adjusted in order to include the eﬀect of many other factors (for example, radiative processes) and to be applied over a speciﬁc range of scales (mesoscale models, for example). Such studies are crucial in the eﬀort to understand the climate and ecology of our planet. REFERENCES Bolton, D., The computation of equivalent potential temperature, Mon. Wea.
