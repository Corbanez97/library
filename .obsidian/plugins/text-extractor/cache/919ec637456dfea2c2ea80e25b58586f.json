We will define some new sequences of random variables and inquire whether they form a Bernoulli process. 1. Let ¥, = Xp,. Is the sequence Y5, a Bernoulli process? ¥ Answer: Yes 2.Let Uy = X,41. Is the sequence U, a Bernoulli process? X Answer: Yes 3.Let V;, = X, + Xpy1. Is the sequence V;, a Bernoulli process? X Answer: No 4.Let W, = (—1)\" X,,. s the sequence W, a Bernoulli process? Answer: No Solution: 1. Yes, because the random variables Xa, are independent Bernoulli random variables with the same parameter. 2. Yes, for the same reason. 3. No, because, for example Vi = X1 + X3 and V5 = X3 + Xj are both affected by X and are therefore dependent. In addition, each V;, can take value 2 and is therefore not Bernoull. 4.No, because TW; can take value —1 and therefore is not a Bernoulli random variable.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
