First, we derive them in the framework of the General Relativity keeping the relativistic expressions as a reference for the rest of the report. Then, using the Newtonian formalism and solving some fundamental problems, we reach some dy- namical equations for the universe and compare the results with the relativistic ones, focusing our attention on the meaning of the expressions and on the cosmological constant. I. INTRODUCTION We study the universe that follows from the cosmolog- ical principle. The cosmological principle states that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous at a large scale. Due to the symmetries that this principle implies, we can set a cosmological time which allows us to have a reference time to study the universe dynamics. The Friedman equations, the dynamical equations of a homogeneous and isotopic universe, were ﬁrst derived using General Relativity, so the question is, why had not Newton found the dynamical equations for the universe at his time? The problem was that classical mechanics is a global theory that involves the gravitational potential which diverges in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. Einstein also had problems when he tried to apply his equations to the universe even though General Relativity is a local theory as it uses diﬀerential geometry, instead of diﬀerential calculus. At his time it was believed that the universe was static but he found dynamical equations that involved acceleration terms. Thus, the only solution he found to impose a static universe was to add a con- stant term called the cosmological constant. In the end, when he accepted the non-static universe because Fried- man reached that conclusion, he said that the cosmologi- cal constant was the biggest mistake of his life. However, nowadays the cosmological constant has been introduced again to study the eﬀect of exotic components, for in- stance the dark energy. Because of that, we are going to add the cosmological constant to the Newtonian deriva- tion to see what it implies. II. RELATIVISTIC FRIEDMAN EQUATIONS Our aim in this chapter is to derive the general dy- namic equations of a homogeneous and isotropic uni- verse. Working in the framework of General Relativity it is essential to achieve that purpose, as General Rela- tivity is the accepted gravitational theory nowadays. In fact, what we are going to do is to adapt a nature law, as Einstein equations are, to a universe that follows the cos- ∗Electronic address: jar_johan@hotmail.com mological principle. We are going to work in the frame where c = 1 and use Einstein notation. A. Einstein equations Einstein equations are Rµν − 1 2 gµνR − Λgµν = 8πGTµν (1) The left-hand member of (1) is the Einstein tensor (Gµν) in which we have plugged an extra term that in- cludes the cosmological constant. This extra term only gathers importance when we are working in the cosmol- ogy ﬁeld, which is the case. In the right-hand member G is the universal gravita- tional constant and Tµν is the energy-momentum tensor, its explicit expression is Tµν = (ρ + p)uµuν − pgµν (2) gµν is the metric of the manifold where the equations apply and uα is the macroscopic speed of the medium. B. Robertson-Walker metric Notice that in Einstein tensor (Gµν) there is a Ricci tensor and a Ricci escalar. The metric with which we are going to calculate them is the one that we need to particularise our ﬁnal expressions for the homogeneous and isotropic universe. Therefore now we have to ﬁnd a metric (gµν) that includes all the diﬀerent aspects of the cosmological principle. The answer is the Robertson- Walker metric ds2 = dt 2 − a2(t) ( 1 1 − r2 K2 dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin 2 θdϕ 2) (3) We see that the Robertson-Walker metric describes an isotropic universe, because it does not have crossed terms between time and space so there is not any privileged direction. And it also describes homogeneous universe because of the spherical symmetry. The factor a(t) is called the scale factor and it is the temporal dependence between the relative distance of two Derivation of Friedman equations Joan Arnau Romeu points of the universe. The scale factor is deﬁned to be 1 in the present time. From now on the time dependence of the scale factor can be implicit, so a(t) ≡ a. K −2 is directly related to the curvature radius of the spatial hypersurface. Notice that if K −2 = 0 and a 2(t) = 1 we have the usual euclidean metric for spher- ical symmetry. It can be seen that if K −2 > 0 we have a close universe (the volumic integral converges) and if K −2 < 0 we have an open universe (the volumic integral diverges). C. Calculation of the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar Remember that we need the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar to particularise Einstein equations for a homoge- neous and isotropic universe. First we need to calculate the Christoﬀel symbols of Robertson-Walker metric (3). Γ l ji = 1 2 glm(∂jgmi + ∂igmj − ∂mgij) (4) Fortunately, Robertson-Walker metric is diagonal and has a symmetric connection, so the majority of the Christoﬀel symbols will be symmetric or null. The ones which are diﬀerent from zero are • Γ t rr = a ˙a 1− r2 K2 • Γ t θθ = r2a ˙a • Γ t ϕϕ = r2a ˙a sin 2 θ • Γ r tr = Γ r rt = Γ θ tθ = Γ θ θt = Γ ϕ tϕ = Γ ϕ ϕt = ˙a a • Γ r rr = r K2(1− r2 K2 ) • Γ r θθ = −r(1 − r2 K2 ) • Γ r ϕϕ = −r(1 − r2 K2 ) sin 2 θ • Γ θ rθ = Γ θ θr = Γ ϕ rϕ = Γ ϕ ϕr = 1 r • Γ θ ϕϕ = − sin θ cos θ • Γ ϕ ϕθ = Γ ϕ θϕ = 1 tan θ Once the Christoﬀel symbols have been calculated, we can calculate the Riemann tensor Rl kji = ∂iΓl kj − ∂jΓl ki + Γm kjΓ l mi − Γm kiΓ l mj (5) In fact, we are only interested in the Riemann tensor components that have the same top index as the middle bottom one. These components are enough to calculate the Ricci tensor (Rm imj). The only components of the Ricci tensor that are diﬀerent from 0 are • Rtt = Rm tmt = Rr trt + Rθ tθt + Rϕ tϕt = −3 ¨a a • Rrr = Rm rmr = a¨a 1− r2 K2 + 2 ˙a2 1− r2 K2 + 2 K2(1− r2 K2 ) • Rθθ = Rm θmθ = r2a¨a + 2r2 ˙a 2 + 2 r2 K2 • Rϕϕ = Rm ϕmϕ = r2a¨a sin 2 θ + 2r2 ˙a 2 sin 2 θ + 2 r2 K2 sin 2 θ We can see that the Ricci tensor is diagonal, to sum- marize the result we can state Rtt = −3 ¨a a (6) Rii = −gii a2 (a¨a + 2 ˙a 2 + 2K −2) (7) Finally we can get the Ricci scalar: R = gikRik = −6 ¨a a − 6 ( ˙a a )2 − 6 1 K 2a2 (8) D. Energy-momentum tensor for a perfect ﬂuid By deﬁnition a perfect ﬂuid is the one that is isotropic, which means that it has to look equal to us in every direction we can move. Then, the macroscopic speed of the ﬂuid cannot have a privileged direction, so it has only temporal component: uα = (1, 0, 0, 0). Notice that u t = 1 because of the restricted relativity. (u α) 2 = gαβu αu β = c2 = 1 ⇒ gtt(u t) 2 = c 2 ⇔ u t = 1 Now, taking into account the expression (2), we can ﬁnd the energy-momentum tensor for a perfect ﬂuid. We see that it is diagonal and its components are Ttt = ρgtt (9) Tii = −pgii (10) We see that for our derivation we can think about the universe being ﬁlled by a perfect ﬂuid as this kind of ﬂuid follows the cosmological principle. E. Friedman Equations In the previous sections we have calculated and derived all the elements that we need to reach our goal. Now we only have to plug all the elements to Einstein equations (1). The only equations that will be diﬀerent from the null one are those which have the same indexes, since our metric is diagonal. Therefore we start with the temporal part. Rtt − 1 2 Rgtt − Λgtt = 8πGρutut Treball de Fi de Grau 2 Barcelona, June 2014 Derivation of Friedman equations Joan Arnau Romeu −3 ¨a a + 3 ¨a a + 3 ( ˙a a )2 + 3 1 K 2a2 − Λ = 8πGρ(t) We arrive at ( ˙a(t) a(t) )2 = 8πG 3 ρ(t) + Λ 3 − 1 K 2a2(t) (11) Now we can study the spacial part. For each spacial component we reach the same equation −gii a2(t) (a¨a + 2 ˙a 2 + 2 K 2 ) − 1 2 Rgii − Λgii = 8πG(−p)gii Removing the metric from both sides we obtain − ¨a a −2 ( ˙a a )2− 2 K 2a2 +3 ¨a a +3 ( ˙a a )2+ 3 K 2a2 −Λ = −8πGp ¨a(t) a(t) + 1 2 ( ˙a(t) a(t) )2 = −4πGp + Λ 2 − 1 2 1 K 2a2(t) (12) If we pay attention, we realize that making a linear combination between (11) and (12) we can get an equa- tion without the ( ˙a a ) 2 term, whose meaning will be easier to interpret. If we do 2 · (12) − (11) we reach ¨a(t) a(t) = − 4πG 3 (ρ(t) + 3p) + Λ 3 (13) Notice that there are only two independent Friedman equations. The ones we are going to take as the reference are (11) and (13). In conclusion we can state that Friedman equations say that in general conditions the universe is not static. To know the physical meaning of these equations ﬁrst we have to make the Newtonian derivation comparing both results. III. NEWTONIAN FRIEDMAN EQUATIONS In this chapter we want to derive again Friedman Equa- tions but now following Newton mechanics. We want to adapt a global theory, in this case classical mechanics, to the cosmological principle. To reach our goal we are go- ing to solve diﬀerent fundamental problems that we have not had with General Relativity, which is a local theory. A. Divergence of the Newton potential From classical mechanics we know that the Newton potential using spherical symmetry for a diﬀerential piece of mass (m) in a homogeneous space has the following expression: V = −G ∫ M 1 r dm = −G ∫ V ρ r dv (14) We see that we have to make the integral over all the homogeneous matter distribution, which brings us to ﬁnd a singularity. The total mass and volume of a Newtonian homogeneous universe has to be inﬁnite so that the uni- verse does not collapse, therefore necessarily any imag- inary matter sphere of the universe has to have more matter outside it, to oﬀset the internal attractive force. To solve that problem we have to take into account that all the points of an homogeneous universe are equivalent, so with that we can study the relative movement between two random points of the universe. We consider one point as the origin and we describe an sphere passing through the other point. It is clear that the external shell of the sphere only feels the internal force because the external one is compensated by the spherical symmetry, as the Gauss theorem states. Now we can integrate the potential. V = −4πG ∫ R(t) 0 ρ(t)r2 r dr = −4πGρ(t) R(t)2 2 (15) Where R(t) is the relative distance between the two points of the universe. B. Necessity of a reference frame In the previous section we have talked about distances so, like in any system in classical mechanics, we need a reference point and a reference frame to deﬁne the dis- tances. If a continuous system is given, the essential reference point to describe the distances within the system itself is the center of mass ⃗rCM = ∫ M ⃗rdm ∫ M dm (16) Notice that, if we try to calculate the center of mass, we are going to have a problem with a divergence again be- cause we are working with an inﬁnite system. Therefore it implies that every point of the universe is the center of mass itself. Classical mechanics use the far stars as an inertial ref- erence system, we are going to generalize this concept as the cosmic ﬂuid, which contains the far galaxies. The observations state that locally the universe moves in con- junction with the cosmic ﬂuid, so there is no any peculiar speed between them. Finding the relativistic Friedman equations we have found that the universe is not static, therefore the cos- mic ﬂuid could be in expansion. This means that we have to reject the idea of ﬁnding an inertial frame for our problem, as deﬁning something external to the universe to refer the universe itself does not make any sense. We know that we can only use Newtonian cosmology if we do not go far in space and time because then the relativistic eﬀects show up. Thus, to refer our system distances we can use the the cosmic ﬂuid but bearing in Treball de Fi de Grau 3 Barcelona, June 2014 Derivation of Friedman equations Joan Arnau Romeu mind that it is not an inertial frame. Therefore to apply the Newton law in its common form ( ⃗F = m⃗a) we have to take into account that our reference point could be changing. Because of this, we have introduce the known scale factor (a(t)) which will absorb all temporal changes that aﬀect our reference frame. In conclusion, from now we are going to denote the relative distances as R(t) = a(t)R. C. Conservation of mass In the relativistic derivations we have seen that the fundamental physics principle, the energy conservation, must be fulﬁlled like in all the physical models. Now we are working within the classical mechanics which means that the mass and the energy are independent concepts. So, apart from the energy conservation principle, another principle have to be fulﬁlled: the mass conservation. We know that the mass (M ) that is inside a shell of radius R(t) is M = ∫ M dm = 4π 3 ρ(t)a 3(t)R3 (17) Now we impose that the mass inside the shell cannot vary with the time. dM dt = 0 = 4π 3 (ρ(t)3a 2(t) ˙a(t)R3 + a 3(t)R3 dρ(t) dt ) Simplifying all the terms that we can, we ﬁnd the next relation: ˙ρ(t) = −3ρ(t) ˙a(t) a(t) (18) We have found the Newtonian Friedman equation of the conservation of mass. Notice that if we do ˙(11) − (13) for the relativistic part we reach to ˙ρ(t) = −3(ρ(t) + p) ˙a(t) a(t) (19) For the Newtonian part we have found the same ex- pression but for a pressure-less material called the dust gas. This result makes sense because in classical mechan- ics the ﬁeld does not carry energy, so the gravitational ﬁeld cannot make pressure. D. Acceleration equation Having ﬁxed the fundamentals problems we can pro- ceed to apply the Newton equations. Thanks to the spherical symmetry we will be able to work with the mod- ulus of the diﬀerent vectorial magnitudes. The gravitational force that a piece of mass m is going to suﬀer is: ⃗F = −m⃗∇V = −G Mint R2(t) mˆr (20) So plugging the force to the second Newton’s law: m d2a(t)R dt2 = −Gm Mint a2(t)R2 = −Gm 4π 3 a 3(t)R3 a2(t)R2 ρ(t) Notice that m and R can be removed. So at the and we get: ¨a(t) a(t) = − 4πG 3 ρ(t) (21) We have reached to the acceleration Newtonian Fried- man equation which implies a non-static universe again. If we compare this equation with (13) we see that it is very similar to the relativistic one but, again for a dust gas (p = 0). Furthermore, we see that there is not the term of the cosmological constant, which means that the cosmological constant does not come from the gravita- tional force. The acceleration equation and the conservation of mass equation are independent so, again we see that we have only two linear independent Friedman equations. E. Energy conservation With the equations we have already found we have the necessity to see that in this equations there is hidden the energy conservation principle. We take the acceleration equation (21) and we integrate it to obtain expressions with only the ﬁrst temporal derivatives of the scale factor, to see if we ﬁnd the kinetic energy. ¨R(t) = −G 4π 3 ρ(t)R(t) = −G Mint R2(t) Now we multiply by ˙R(t) and we integrate the equation. ˙R(t) ¨R(t) = G Mint R2(t) ˙R(t) 1 2 ˙R2(t) = G Mint R(t) + U (22) We see that we have reached an expression that have clearly the form of the energy conservation equation. It is possible to distinguish the terms of the kinetic energy and the potential energy, but we see that a wild integra- tion constant have appeared so we have to interpret its meaning. If we manipulate the equation, we can compare the found expression with the relativistic one (11). ( ˙a(t) a(t) )2 = 8πG 3 ρ(t) + 2U R2a2(t) (23) Like in the other equations, we see that we have the same relativistic expression but for the dust gas and with- out the constant cosmological constant term. But the Treball de Fi de Grau 4 Barcelona, June 2014 Derivation of Friedman equations Joan Arnau Romeu interesting term to analyse is the last one, the one that contains a −2(t). Comparing both equations, (11) and (23), we see that the last term is related to the curvature term in the rel- ativistic case, but in the Newtonian one we cannot talk about curvature because we are working with the eu- clidean metric. We see that we can associate U to some kind of mechanical energy, because it is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential one, and also it is a dy- namic constant. So by analogy with the curvature term, we can distin- guish diﬀerent types of universe in function of the U sign (notice that the last term of (11) and (24) have diﬀerent sign). If U > 0 the equations are going to a universe that re-collapses. If U < 0 the universe is going to expand forever. For U = 0 we have the intermediate case, the universe is going to expand to inﬁnity but reaching a null speed. F. Newtonian Friedman equations adding a cosmological constant In the previous chapter we have seen that the cosmo- logical constant does not appear in a natural way in the Newtonian Friedman equations, this implies that we have to see how we have to change the potential so as the cos- mological constant appears. Nowadays, thanks to the astronomical observations, we know that the cosmologi- cal constant term acts as a repulsive force proportional to the radial distance (in classical terms) that suﬀers a mass m . So we add that new force to the second Newton law. m d 2a(t)R dt2 = −Gm 4π 3 a 3(t)R3 a2(t)R2 ρ(t) + Λ 3 a(t)Rm We are able to put a factor 1 3 in the cosmological con- stant term as it is an arbitrary constant. With this we are going to compare easily the obtained result with the relativistic expressions. After some algebra, the previous expression we reach the acceleration equation. ¨a(t) a(t) = −G 4π 3 ρ(t) + Λ 3 (24) Now, following the same steps that in the previous chapter, we can derive the energy conservation expres- sion. The meaning of the integration constant (U ) is going to be still the same, the mechanical energy. ( ˙a(t) a(t) )2 = 8πG 3 ρ(t) + Λ 3 + 2U R2a2(t) (25) Furthermore, we can ﬁnd the mass conservation equa- tion in the same way that in the previous chapter, so now we are going to ﬁnd the equation (18) again. We see that we have obtained the same equations that in the last chapter, indeed the relativistic Friedman equa- tions for a pressure-less ﬂuid, but this time with the cos- mological constant term as expected. IV. CONCLUSIONS • In both, relativistic and Newtonian Friedman equa- tions derivation, we have arrived to dynamical ex- pressions that describe a non-static isotropic and homogeneous universe in general conditions. • For a homogeneous and isotropic universe there are only two independent Friedman equations. • The Newtonian Friedman equations are the same as the relativistic ones but for a pressure-less ﬂuid called the dust gas. In the energy conservation ex- pression we have found a sort of curvature term which we have seen that it contains implicitly the mechanical energy of the Newtonian universe. • Comparing the relativistic expressions with the Newtonian ones, we have seen that the relativis- tic expressions fulﬁll the energy conservation and the mass conservation principles. • The cosmological constant does not appear in a natural way in the Newtonian derivation of the Friedman equations derived only from the gravi- tational potential. For the cosmological constant term to appear, we have to add an extra term to the Newtonian potential acting as a repulsive force proportional to the radial distance.
