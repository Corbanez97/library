Two prominent ones are • Prange and Girvin, “The Quantum Hall Eﬀect” This is a collection of articles by most of the main players circa 1990. The basics are described well but there’s nothing about Chern-Simons theories or the importance of the edge modes. • J. K. Jain, “Composite Fermions” As the title suggests, this book focuses on the composite fermion approach as a lens through which to view all aspects of the quantum Hall eﬀect. It has many good explanations but doesn’t cover the more ﬁeld theoretic aspects of the subject. There are also a number of good multi-purpose condensed matter textbooks which contain extensive descriptions of the quantum Hall eﬀect. Two, in particular, stand out: • Eduardo Fradkin, Field Theories of Condensed Matter Physics • Xiao-Gang Wen, Quantum Field Theory of Many-Body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons Several excellent lecture notes covering the various topics discussed in these lec- tures are available on the web.

Magnetic Scales Cyclotron Frequency: ωB = eB 1. The Basics 1.1 Introduction Take a bunch of electrons, restrict them to move in a two-dimensional plane and turn on a strong magnetic ﬁeld. This simple set-up provides the setting for some of the most wonderful and surprising results in physics. These phenomena are known collectively as the quantum Hall eﬀect. The name comes from the most experimentally visible of these surprises. The Hall conductivity (which we will deﬁne below) takes quantised values σxy = e 2 Because of this kind of striking behaviour, the quantum Hall eﬀect has been a con- stant source of new ideas, providing hints of where to look for interesting and novel phenomena, most of them related to the ways in which the mathematics of topology impinges on quantum physics. Important examples include the subject of topological insulators, topological order and topological quantum computing. All of them have their genesis in the quantum Hall eﬀect. Underlying all of these phenomena is an impressive theoretical ediﬁce, which involves a tour through some of the most beautiful and important developments in theoretical and mathematical physics over the past decades. The ﬁrst attack on the problem fo- cussed on the microscopic details of the electron wavefunctions. Subsequent approaches looked at the system from a more coarse-grained, ﬁeld-theoretic perspective where a subtle construction known as Chern-Simons theory plays the key role. Yet another perspective comes from the edge of the sample where certain excitations live that know more about what’s happening inside than you might think. The main purpose of these lectures is to describe these diﬀerent approaches and the intricate and surprising links between them. 1.2 The Classical Hall Eﬀect The original, classical Hall eﬀect was discovered in 1879 by Edwin Hall. It is a simple consequence of the motion of charged particles in a magnetic ﬁeld. We’ll start these lectures by reviewing the underlying physics of the Hall eﬀect. This will provide a useful background for our discussion of the quantum Hall eﬀect. Here’s the set-up. We turn on a constant mag- xI HV B Figure 1: The classical Hall ef- fect netic ﬁeld, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)- plane. A constant current I is made to ﬂow in the x-direction. The Hall eﬀect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the ﬁgure to the right. 1.2.1 Classical Motion in a Magnetic Field The Hall eﬀect arises from the fact that a magnetic ﬁeld causes charged particles to move in circles. Let’s recall the basics. The equation of motion for a particle of mass m and charge −e in a magnetic ﬁeld is mdv When the magnetic ﬁeld points in the z-direction, so that B = (0, 0, B), and the particle moves only in the transverse plane, so v = ( ˙x, ˙y, 0), the equations of motion become two, coupled diﬀerential equations m¨x = −eB ˙y and m¨y = eB ˙x (1.1) The general solution is x(t) = X − R sin(ωBt + φ) and y(t) = Y + R cos(ωBt + φ) (1.2) We see that the particle moves in a circle which, for B > 0, is in B Figure 2: an anti-clockwise direction. The centre of the circle, (X, Y ), the radius of the circle R and the phase φ are all arbitrary. These are the four integration constants from solving the two second order diﬀerential equations. However, the frequency with which the particle goes around the circle is ﬁxed, and given by ωB = eB We’re interested in equilibrium solutions of (1.4) which have dv/dt = 0. The velocity of the particle must then solve v + eτ Although it’s not directly relevant for our story, it’s worth pausing to think about how we actually approach equilibrium in the Hall eﬀect. We start by putting an electric ﬁeld in the x-direction. This gives rise to a current density Jx, but this current is deﬂected due to the magnetic ﬁeld and bends towards the y-direction. In a ﬁnite material, this results in a build up of charge along the edge and an associated electric ﬁeld Ey. This continues until the electric ﬁeld Ey cancels the bending of due to the magnetic ﬁeld, and the electrons then travel only in the x-direction. It’s this induced electric ﬁeld Ey which is responsible for the Hall voltage VH. Resistivity vs Resistance The resistivity is deﬁned as the inverse of the conductivity. This remains true when both are matrices, ρ = σ−1 = ( ρxx ρxy −ρxy ρyy ) (1.7) From the Drude model, we have ρ = 1 While we’re throwing diﬀerent deﬁnitions around, here’s one more. For a current Ix ﬂowing in the x-direction, and the associated electric ﬁeld Ey in the y-direction, the Hall coeﬃcient is deﬁned by RH = − Ey 1.3.1 Integer Quantum Hall Eﬀect The ﬁrst experiments exploring the quantum regime of the Hall eﬀect were performed in 1980 by von Klitzing, using samples prepared by Dorda and Pepper1. The resistivities look like this: This is the integer quantum Hall eﬀect. For this, von Klitzing was awarded the 1985 Nobel prize. Both the Hall resistivity ρxy and the longitudinal resistivity ρxx exhibit interesting behaviour. Perhaps the most striking feature in the data is the that the Hall resistivity ρxy sits on a plateau for a range of magnetic ﬁeld, before jumping suddenly to the next plateau. On these plateau, the resistivity takes the value ρxy = 2πℏ where n is the electron density and Φ0 = 2πℏ/e is known as the ﬂux quantum. As we will review in Section 2, these are the values of the magnetic ﬁeld at which the ﬁrst ν ∈ Z Landau levels are ﬁlled. In fact, as we will see, it is very easy to argue that the Hall resistivity should take value (1.9) when ν Landau levels are ﬁlled. The surprise is that the plateau exists, with the quantisation persisting over a range of magnetic ﬁelds. There is a clue in the experimental data about the origin of the plateaux. Experi- mental systems are typically dirty, ﬁlled with impurities. The technical name for this is disorder. Usually one wants to remove this dirt to get at the underlying physics. Yet, in the quantum Hall eﬀect, as you increase the amount of disorder (within reason) the plateaux become more prominent, not less. In fact, in the absence of disorder, the plateaux are expected to vanish completely. That sounds odd: how can the presence of dirt give rise to something as exact and pure as an integer? This is something we will explain in Section 2. The longitudinal resistivity ρxx also exhibits a surprise. When ρxy sits on a plateau, the longitudinal resistivity vanishes: ρxx = 0. It spikes only when ρxy jumps to the next plateau. Usually we would think of a system with ρxx = 0 as a perfect conductor. But there’s something a little counter-intuitive about vanishing resistivity in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. To see this, we can return to the simple deﬁnition (1.7) which, in components, reads σxx = ρxx done in accelerating charges. The fact that this vanishes means that we have a steady current ﬂowing without doing any work and, correspondingly, without any dissipation. The fact that σxx = 0 is telling us that no current is ﬂowing in the longitudinal direction (like an insulator) while the fact that ρxx = 0 is telling us that there is no dissipation of energy (like in a perfect conductor). 1.3.2 Fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect As the disorder is decreased, the integer Hall plateaux become less prominent. But other plateaux emerge at fractional values. This was discovered in 1982 by Tsui and St¨ormer using samples prepared by Gossard 2. The resistivities look like this: The is the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect. On the plateaux, the Hall resistivity again takes the simple form (1.9), but now with ν a rational number ν ∈ Q Not all fractions appear. The most prominent plateaux sit at ν = 1/3, 1/5 (not shown above) and 2/5 but there are many more. The vast majority of these have denominators which are odd. But there are exceptions: in particular a clear plateaux has been observed at ν = 5/2. As the disorder is decreased, more and more plateaux emerge. It seems plausible that in the limit of a perfectly clean sample, we would get an inﬁnite number of plateaux which brings us back to the classical picture of a straight line for ρxy! The integer quantum Hall eﬀect can be understood using free electrons. In contrast, to explain the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect we need to take interactions between elec- trons into account. This makes the problem much harder and much richer. The basics of the theory were ﬁrst laid down by Laughlin 3, but the subject has since expanded in a myriad of diﬀerent directions. The 1998 Nobel prize was awarded to Tsui, St¨ormer and Laughlin. Sections 3 onwards will be devoted to aspects of the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect. Materials These lectures are unabashedly theoretical. We’ll have nothing to say about how one actually constructs these phases of matter in the lab. Here I want to merely throw out a few technical words in an attempt to breed familiarity. The integer quantum Hall eﬀect was originally discovered in a Si MOSFET (this stands for “metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor”). This is a metal-insulator- semiconductor sandwich, with electrons trapped in the “inversion band” of width ∼ 30˚A between the insulator and semi-conductor. Meanwhile the fractional quantum Hall ef- fect was discovered in a GaAs-GaAlAs heterostructure. A lot of the subsequent work was done on this system, and it usually goes by the name GaAs (Gallium Arsenide if your chemistry is rusty). In both these systems, the density of electrons is around n ∼ 1011 − 1012 cm −2. More recently, both quantum Hall eﬀects have been discovered in graphene, which is a two dimensional material with relativistic electrons. The physics here is similar in spirit, but diﬀers in details. 1.4 Landau Levels It won’t come as a surprise to learn that the physics of the quantum Hall eﬀect in- volves quantum mechanics. In this section, we will review the quantum mechanics of free particles moving in a background magnetic ﬁeld and the resulting phenomenon of Landau levels. We will look at these Landau levels in a number of diﬀerent ways. Each is useful to highlight diﬀerent aspects of the physics and they will all be important for describing the quantum Hall eﬀects. Throughout this discussion, we will neglect the spin of the electron. This is more or less appropriate for most physically realised quantum Hall systems. The reason is that in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld B there is a Zeeman splitting between the energies of the up and down spins given by ∆ = 2µBB where µB = eℏ/2m is the Bohr magneton. We will be interested in large magnetic ﬁelds where large energies are needed to ﬂip the spin. This means that, if we restrict to low energies, the electrons act as if they are eﬀectively spinless. (We will, however, add a caveat to this argument below.) Before we get to the quantum theory, we ﬁrst need to brieﬂy review some of the structure of classical mechanics in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The Lagrangian for a particle of charge −e and mass m moving in a background magnetic ﬁeld B = ∇ × A is L = 1 call “momentum”. But it doesn’t have canonical Poisson structure. Speciﬁcally, the Poisson bracket of the mechanical momentum with itself is non-vanishing, {m ˙xi, m ˙xj} = {pi + eAi, pj + eAj} = −e (∂Aj which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering oper- ators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator H = 1 level n + 1. In fact, in real materials, this does not happen. The reason is twofold. First, the true value of the cyclotron frequency is ωB = eB/meﬀ , where meﬀ is the eﬀective mass of the electron moving in its environment. Second, the g factor can also vary due to eﬀects of band structure. For GaAs, the result is that the Zeeman energy is typically about 70 times smaller than the cyclotron energy. This means that ﬁrst the n = 0 spin-up Landau level ﬁlls, then the n = 0 spin-down, then the n = 1 spin-up and so on. For other materials (such as the interface between ZnO and MnZnO) the relative size of the energies can be ﬂipped and you can ﬁll levels in a diﬀerent order. This results in diﬀerent fractional quantum Hall states. In these notes, we will mostly ignore these issues to do with spin. (One exception is Section 3.3.4 where we discuss wavefunctions for particles with spin). 1.4.1 Landau Gauge To ﬁnd wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we ﬁrst need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆz There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two diﬀerent choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆy (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic ﬁeld B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic ﬁeld. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H = 1 Acting on this wavefunction with the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue ℏk, Hψk(x, y) = 1 Degeneracy One advantage of this approach is that we can immediately see the degeneracy in each Landau level. The wavefunction (1.20) depends on two quantum numbers, n and k but the energy levels depend only on n. Let’s now see how large this degeneracy is. To do this, we need to restrict ourselves to a ﬁnite region of the (x, y)-plane. We pick a rectangle with sides of lengths Lx and Ly. We want to know how many states ﬁt inside this rectangle. Having a ﬁnite size Ly is like putting the system in a box in the y-direction. We know that the eﬀect of this is to quantise the momentum k in units of 2π/Ly. Having a ﬁnite size Lx is somewhat more subtle. The reason is that, as we mentioned above, the gauge choice (1.17) does not have manifest translational invariance in the x-direction. This means that our argument will be a little heuristic. Because the wavefunctions (1.20) are exponentially localised around x = −kl2 B, for a ﬁnite sample restricted to 0 ≤ x ≤ Lx we would expect the allowed k values to range between −Lx/l2 B ≤ k ≤ 0. The end result is that the number of states is N = Ly 1.4.2 Turning on an Electric Field The Landau gauge is useful for working in rectangular geometries. One of the things that is particularly easy in this gauge is the addition of an electric ﬁeld E in the x direction. We can implement this by the addition of an electric potential φ = −Ex. The resulting Hamiltonian is H = 1 1.4.3 Symmetric Gauge Having understood the basics of Landau levels, we’re now going to do it all again. This time we’ll work in symmetric gauge, with A = −1 The commutators of this new momenta diﬀer from (1.15) only by a minus sign [˜πx, ˜πy] = ieℏB (1.29) However, the lack of gauge invariance shows up when we take the commutators of π and ˜π. We ﬁnd [πx, ˜πx] = 2ieℏ ∂Ax level are annihilated by a, meaning a|0, m⟩ = 0 The trick is to convert this into a diﬀerential equation. The lowering operator is a = 1 We can construct the speciﬁc states |0, m⟩ in the lowest Landau level by similarly writing b and b † as diﬀerential operators. We ﬁnd b = −i √ However, it’s worth seeing how we can see the degeneracy of states in symmetric gauge. The wavefunction with angular momentum m is peaked on a ring of radius r = √ Figure 6: The degrees of freedom x. Figure 7: The parameters λ. interpretation of the centre of the orbit! The commutation relation (1.29) then tells us that the positions of the orbit in the (X, Y ) plane fail to commute with each other, [X, Y ] = il2 B (1.35) The lack of commutivity is precisely the magnetic length l2 B = ℏ/eB. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle now means that we can’t localise states in both the X coordinate and the Y coordinate: we have to ﬁnd a compromise. In general, the uncertainty is given by ∆X∆Y = 2πl2 B A naive semi-classical count of the states then comes from taking the plane and par- celling it up into regions of area 2πl2 B. The number of states in an area A is then N = A 1.5.1 Abelian Berry Phase and Berry Connection We’ll describe the Berry phase arising for a general Hamiltonian which we write as H(x a; λi) As we’ve illustrated, the Hamiltonian depends on two diﬀerent kinds of variables. The x a are the degrees of freedom of the system. These are the things that evolve dynam- ically, the things that we want to solve for in any problem. They are typically things like the positions or spins of particles. In contrast, the other variables λi are the parameters of the Hamiltonian. They are ﬁxed, with their values determined by some external apparatus that probably involves knobs and dials and ﬂashing lights and things as shown above. We don’t usually exhibit the dependence of H on these variables 5. Here’s the game. We pick some values for the parameters λ and place the system in a speciﬁc energy eigenstate |ψ⟩ which, for simplicity, we will take to be the ground state. We assume this ground state is unique (an assumption which we will later relax in Section 1.5.4). Now we very slowly vary the parameters λ. The Hamiltonian changes so, of course, the ground state also changes; it is |ψ(λ(t))⟩. There is a theorem in quantum mechanics called the adiabatic theorem. This states that if we place a system in a non-degenerate energy eigenstate and vary parameters suﬃciently slowly, then the system will cling to that energy eigenstate. It won’t be excited to any higher or lower states. There is one caveat to the adiabatic theorem. How slow you have to be in changing the parameters depends on the energy gap from the state you’re in to the nearest other state. This means that if you get level crossing, where another state becomes degenerate with the one you’re in, then all bets are oﬀ. When the states separate again, there’s no simple way to tell which linear combinations of the state you now sit in. However, level crossings are rare in quantum mechanics. In general, you have to tune three parameters to speciﬁc values in order to get two states to have the same energy. This follows by thinking about the a general Hermitian 2 × 2 matrix which can be viewed as the Hamiltonian for the two states of interest. The general Hermitian 2×2 matrix depends on 4 parameters, but its eigenvalues only coincide if it is proportional to the identity matrix. This means that three of those parameters have to be set to zero. The idea of the Berry phase arises in the following situation: we vary the parameters λ but, ultimately, we put them back to their starting values. This means that we trace out a closed path in the space of parameters. We will assume that this path did not go through a point with level crossing. The question is: what state are we now in? The adiabatic theorem tells us most of the answer. If we started in the ground state, we also end up in the ground state. The only thing left uncertain is the phase of this new state |ψ⟩ → e iγ|ψ⟩ We often think of the overall phase of a wavefunction as being unphysical. But that’s not the case here because this is a phase diﬀerence. For example, we could have started with two states and taken only one of them on this journey while leaving the other unchanged. We could then interfere these two states and the phase e iγ would have physical consequence. So what is the phase e iγ? There are two contributions. The ﬁrst is simply the dynamical phase e −iEt/ℏ that is there for any energy eigenstate, even if the parameters don’t change. But there is also another, less obvious contribution to the phase. This is the Berry phase. Computing the Berry Phase The wavefunction of the system evolves through the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa- tion iℏ ∂|ψ⟩ There’s always the dynamical contribution to the phase, given by e −i ∫ dt E0(t)/ℏ where E0 is the ground state energy. This is not what’s interesting here and we will ignore it simply by setting E0(t) = 0. However, there is an extra contribution. This arises by plugging the adiabatic ansatz into (1.36), and taking the overlap with ⟨ψ|. We have ⟨ψ| ˙ψ⟩ = ˙UU ⋆ + ⟨n| ˙n⟩ = 0 where we’ve used the fact that, instantaneously, H(λ)|n(λ)⟩ = 0 to get zero on the right-hand side. (Note: this calculation is actually a little more subtle than it looks. To do a better job we would have to look more closely at corrections to the adiabatic evolution (1.37)). This gives us an expression for the time dependence of the phase U, U ⋆ ˙U = −⟨n| ˙n⟩ = −⟨n| ∂ In the relativistic form of electromagnetism, we have a gauge potential Aµ(x) where µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 and x are coordinates over Minkowski spacetime. There is a redundancy in the description of the gauge potential: all physics remains invariant under the gauge transformation Aµ → A ′ µ = Aµ + ∂µω (1.41) for any function ω(x). In our course on electromagnetism, we were taught that if we want to extract the physical information contained in Aµ, we should compute the ﬁeld strength Fµν = ∂Aµ Following the analogy with electromagnetism, we might expect that the physical information in the Berry connection can be found in the gauge invariant ﬁeld strength which, mathematically, is known as the curvature of the connection, Fij(λ) = ∂Ai The speciﬁc form of | ↑ ⟩ and | ↓ ⟩ will depend on the orientation of ⃗B. To provide more explicit forms for these states, we write the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B in spherical polar coordinates ⃗B =     B sin θ cos φ B sin θ sin φ B cos θ     with θ ∈ [0, π] and φ ∈ [0, 2π) The Hamiltonian then reads H = −B ( cos θ − 1 e −iφ sin θ e +iφ sin θ − cos θ − 1 ) In these coordinates, two normalised eigenstates are given by | ↓ ⟩ = ( e −iφ sin θ/2 − cos θ/2 ) and | ↑ ⟩ = ( e −iφ cos θ/2 sin θ/2 ) These states play the role of our |n(λ)⟩ that we had in our general derivation. Note, however, that they are not well deﬁned for all values of ⃗B. When we have θ = π, the angular coordinate φ is not well deﬁned. This means that | ↓ ⟩ and | ↑ ⟩ don’t have well deﬁned phases. This kind of behaviour is typical of systems with non-trivial Berry phase. We can easily compute the Berry phase arising from these states (staying away from θ = π to be on the safe side). We have Aθ = −i⟨↓ | ∂ B S C C S’ Figure 8: Integrating over S... Figure 9: ...or over S′. Note that the magnetic monopole sits at the point ⃗B = 0 where the two energy levels coincide. Here, the ﬁeld strength is singular. This is the point where we can no longer trust the Berry phase computation. Nonetheless, it is the presence of this level crossing and the resulting singularity which is dominating the physics of the Berry phase. The magnetic monopole has charge g = −1/2, meaning that the integral of the Berry curvature over any two-sphere S 2 which surrounds the origin is ∫ S2 Fij dSij = 4πg = −2π (1.44) Using this, we can easily compute the Berry phase for any path C that we choose to take in the space of magnetic ﬁelds ⃗B. We only insist that the path C avoids the origin. Suppose that the surface S, bounded by C, makes a solid angle Ω. Then, using the form (1.43) of the Berry phase, we have e iγ = exp (−i ∫ S Fij dSij) = exp (iΩ monopole charge. This quantisation extends to a general Berry curvature Fij with an arbitrary number of parameters: the integral of the curvature over any closed surface must be quantised in units of 2π,∫ Fij dSij = 2πC (1.47) The integer C ∈ Z is called the Chern number. 1.5.3 Particles Moving Around a Flux Tube In our course on Electromagentism, we learned that the gauge potential Aµ is unphys- ical: the physical quantities that aﬀect the motion of a particle are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This statement is certainly true classically. Quantum mechanically, it requires some caveats. This is the subject of the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect. As we will show, aspects of the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect can be viewed as a special case of the Berry phase. The starting observation of the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect is that the gauge potential ⃗A appears in the Hamiltonian rather than the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B. Of course, the Hamil- tonian is invariant under gauge transformations so there’s nothing wrong with this. Nonetheless, it does open up the possibility that the physics of a quantum particle can be sensitive to ⃗A in more subtle ways than a classical particle. Spectral Flow To see how the gauge potential ⃗A can aﬀect the physics, B=0 B Figure 10: A par- ticle moving around a solenoid. consider the set-up shown in the ﬁgure. We have a solenoid of area A, carrying magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B and therefore magnetic ﬂux Φ = BA. Outside the solenoid the magnetic ﬁeld is zero. However, the vector potential is not. This follows from Stokes’ theorem which tells us that the line integral outside the solenoid is given by ∮ ⃗A · d⃗r = ∫ ⃗B · d⃗S = Φ This is simply solved in cylindrical polar coordinates by Aφ = Φ Φ E n=1 n=2n=0 Figure 11: The spectral ﬂow for the energy states of a particle moving around a solenoid. Now consider a charged quantum particle restricted to lie in a ring of radius r outside the solenoid. The only dynamical degree of freedom is the angular coordinate φ ∈ [0, 2π). The Hamiltonian is H = 1 is called spectral ﬂow: under a change of parameter — in this case Φ — the spectrum of the Hamiltonian changes, or “ﬂows”. As we change increase the ﬂux by one unit Φ0 the spectrum returns to itself, but individual states have morphed into each other. We’ll see related examples of spectral ﬂow applied to the integer quantum Hall eﬀect in Section 2.2.2. The Aharonov-Bohm Eﬀect The situation described above smells like the Berry phase story. We can cook up a very similar situation that demonstrates the relationship more clearly. Consider a set-up like the solenoid where the magnetic ﬁeld is localised to some region of space. We again consider a particle which sits outside this region. However, this time we restrict the particle to lie in a small box. There can be some interesting physics going on inside the box; we’ll capture this by including a potential V (⃗x) in the Hamiltonian and, in order to trap the particle, we take this potential to be inﬁnite outside the box. The fact that the box is “small” means that the gauge potential is approximately constant inside the box. If we place the centre of the box at position ⃗x = ⃗X, then the Hamiltonian of the system is then H = 1 we take the box in a loop C and bring it back to where we started. The wavefunction comes back to ψ(⃗x − ⃗X0) → e iγψ(⃗x − ⃗X0) with e iγ = exp ( −ie We now play the same game that we saw in the Abelian case. We place the system in one of the N degenerate ground states, vary the parameters in a closed path, and ask: what state does the system return to? This time the adiabatic theorem tells us only that the system clings to the particular energy eigenspace as the parameters are varied. But, now this eigenspace has N-fold degeneracy and the adiabatic theorem does not restrict how the state moves within this subspace. This means that, by the time we return the parameters to their original values, the state could lie anywhere within this N-dimensional eigenspace. We want to know how it’s moved. This is no longer given just by a phase; instead we want to compute a unitary matrix U ⊂ U(N). We can compute this by following the same steps that we took for the Abelian Berry phase. To remove the boring, dynamical phase e −iEt, we again assume that the ground state energy is E = 0 for all values of λ. The time dependent Schr¨odinger equation is again i∂|ψ⟩ The gauge connection Ai is the same kind of object that forms the building block of Yang-Mills theory. Just as in Yang-Mills theory, it suﬀers from an ambiguity in its deﬁnition. Here, the ambiguity arises from the arbitrary choice of basis vectors |na(λ)⟩ for each value of the parameters λ. We could have quite happily picked a diﬀerent basis at each point, |n ′ a(λ)⟩ = Ωab(λ) |nb(λ)⟩ where Ω(λ) ⊂ U(N) is a unitary rotation of the basis elements. As the notation suggests, there is nothing to stop us picking diﬀerent rotations for diﬀerent values of the parameters so Ω can depend on λ. If we compute the Berry connection (1.52) in this new basis, we ﬁnd A′ i = ΩAiΩ † + i ∂Ω Here Ai ⊂ u(N) is an N × N matrix. The notation P stands for “path ordering”. It means that we Taylor expand the exponential and then order the resulting products so that matrices Ai(λ) which appear later in the path are placed to the right. The result is the unitary matrix U ⊂ U(N) which tells us how the states transform. This unitary matrix is called the Berry holonomy. The holonomy is gauge invariant: it does not change under a transformation of the form (1.53). The non-Abelian Berry holonomy does not play a role in the simplest quantum Hall systems. But it will be important in more subtle quantum Hall states which, for obvious reasons, are usually called non-Abelian quantum Hall states. These will be discussed in Section 47. 2. The Integer Quantum Hall Eﬀect In this section we discuss the integer quantum Hall eﬀect. This phenomenon can be understood without taking into account the interactions between electrons. This means that we will assume that the quantum states for a single particle in a magnetic ﬁeld that we described in Section 1.4 will remain the quantum states when there are many particles present. The only way that one particle knows about the presence of others is through the Pauli exclusion principle: they take up space. In contrast, when we come to discuss the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect in Section 3, the interactions between electrons will play a key role. 2.1 Conductivity in Filled Landau Levels Let’s look at what we know. The experimental data for the Hall resistivity shows a number of plateaux labelled by an integer ν. Meanwhile, the energy spectrum forms Landau levels, also labelled by an integer. Each Landau level can accommodate a large, but ﬁnite number of electrons. E k n=1 n=2 n=3 n=4 n=5 n=0 Figure 12: Integer quantum Hall eﬀect Figure 13: Landau levels It’s tempting to think that these integers are the same: ρxy = 2πℏ/e 2ν and when precisely ν Landau levels are ﬁlled. And this is correct. Let’s ﬁrst check that this simple guess works. If know that on a plateau, the Hall resistivity takes the value ρxy = 2πℏ Comparing these two expressions, we see that the density needed to get the resistivity of the νth plateau is n = B The second term above is computing the position expectation value ⟨x⟩ of the eigen- states. But we know from (1.20) and (1.24) that these harmonic oscillator states are shifted from the origin, so that ⟨ψn,k|x|ψn,k⟩ = −ℏk/eB + mE/eB2. The ﬁrst of these terms cancels the explicit ℏk term in the expression for Iy. We’re left with Iy = −eν ∑ k E only in a single direction, as shown in the ﬁgure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric ﬁeld, vanishes. We can also see how the edge modes appear in the x V(x) Figure 15: quantum theory. The edge of the sample is modelled by a potential which rises steeply as shown in the ﬁgure. We’ll work in Landau gauge and consider a rectangular geometry which is ﬁnite only in the x-direction, which we model by V (x). The Hamiltonian is H = 1 Let’s now look at what happens when we ﬁll the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum ℏk but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justiﬁed in drawing the ﬁlled states like this: E F x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are ﬁlled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential diﬀerence ∆µ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we ﬁll up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: E F E F To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all ﬁlled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk and the ﬁlled states looked more like this: E F E F Now the current is shared among all of the states. However, the nice thing about the calculation (2.4) is that it doesn’t matter what shape the potential V takes. As long as it is smooth enough, the resulting Hall conductivity remains quantised as (2.5). For example, you could consider the random potential like this E F E F and you still get the quantised answer (2.4) as long as the random potential V (x) doesn’t extend above EF . As we will describe in Section 2.2.1, these kinds of random potentials introduce another ingredient that is crucial in understanding the quantised Hall plateaux. Everything we’ve described above holds for a single Landau level. It’s easily gener- alised to multiple Landau levels. As long as the chemical potential EF lies between Landau levels, we have n ﬁlled Landau levels, like this E F Correspondingly, there are n types of chiral mode on each edge. A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net eﬀect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. That’s a long way for an electron and, correspondingly, such scattering is highly suppressed. It – 47 – means that currents carried by chiral modes are immune to impurities. However, as we will now see, the impurities do play an important role in the emergence of the Hall plateaux. 2.2 Robustness of the Hall State The calculations above show that if an integer number of Landau levels are ﬁlled, then the longitudinal and Hall resistivities are those observed on the plateaux. But it doesn’t explain why these plateaux exist in the ﬁrst place, nor why there are sharp jumps between diﬀerent plateaux. To see the problem, suppose that we ﬁx the electron density n. Then we only completely ﬁll Landau levels when the magnetic ﬁeld is exactly B = nΦ0/ν for some integer ν. But what happens the rest of the time when B ̸= nΦ0/ν? Now the ﬁnal Landau level is only partially ﬁlled. Now when we apply a small electric ﬁeld, there are accessible states for the electrons to scatter in to. The result is going to be some complicated, out-of-equilibrium distribution of electrons on this ﬁnal Landau level. The longitudinal conductivity σxx will surely be non-zero, while the Hall conductivity will diﬀer from the quantised value (2.3). Yet the whole point of the quantum Hall eﬀect is that the experiments reveal that the quantised values of the resistivity (2.3) persist over a range of magnetic ﬁeld. How is this possible? 2.2.1 The Role of Disorder It turns out that the plateaux owe their existence to one further bit of physics: disorder. This arises because experimental samples are inherently dirty. They contain impurities which can be modelled by adding a random potential V (x) to the Hamiltonian. As we now explain, this random potential is ultimately responsible for the plateaux observed in the quantum Hall eﬀect. There’s a wonderful irony in this: the glorious precision with which these integers ν are measured is due to the dirty, crappy physics of impurities. To see how this works, let’s think about what disorder will likely do to the system. Our ﬁrst expectation is that it will split the degenerate eigenstates that make up a Landau level. This follows on general grounds from quantum perturbation theory: any generic perturbation, which doesn’t preserve a symmetry, will break degeneracies. We will further ask that the strength of disorder is small relative to the splitting of the Landau levels, V ≪ ℏωB (2.6) – 48 – E E Figure 16: Density of states without dis- order... Figure 17: ...and with disorder. In practice, this means that the samples which exhibit the quantum Hall eﬀect actually have to be very clean. We need disorder, but not too much disorder! The energy spectrum in the presence of this weak disorder is the expected to change the quantised Landau levels from the familiar picture in the left-hand ﬁgure, to the more broad spectrum shown in the right-hand ﬁgure. There is a second eﬀect of disorder: it turns many of the quantum states from extended to localised. Here, an extended state is spread throughout the whole system. In contrast, a localised state is restricted to lie in some region of space. We can easily see the existence of these localised states in a semi-classical picture which holds if the potential, in addition to obeying (2.6), varies appreciably on distance scales much greater than the magnetic length lB, |∇V | ≪ ℏωB − + E localised extended Figure 18: The localisation of states due to disorder. Figure 19: The resulting density of states. where we used the fact (1.34) that, in the absence of a potential, [X, H] = [Y, H] = 0, together with the commutation relation [X, Y ] = il2 B (1.35). This says that the centre of mass drifts in a direction ( ˙X, ˙Y ) which is perpendicular to ∇V ; in other words, the motion is along equipotentials. Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand ﬁgure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample. The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand ﬁgure. Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity. Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve ﬁlled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with ﬁxed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons, so – 50 – the Fermi energy will increase. But rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic ﬁeld. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the speciﬁc quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be diﬀerent. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder. We now explain why. 2.2.2 The Role of Gauge Invariance Instead of considering electrons moving in a rectangular Φ B r φ Figure 20: sample, we’ll instead consider electrons moving in the an- nulus shown in the ﬁgure. In this context, this is some- times called a Corbino ring. We usually console ourselves by arguing that if the Hall conductivity is indeed quantised then it shouldn’t depend on the geometry of the sample. (Of course, the ﬂip side of this is that if we’ve really got the right argument, that shouldn’t depend on the geometry of the sample either; unfortunately this argument does.) The nice thing about the ring geometry is that it provides us with an extra handle 8. In addition to the background magnetic ﬁeld B which penetrates the sample, we can thread an additional ﬂux Φ through the centre of the ring. Inside the ring, this Φ is locally pure gauge. Nonetheless, from our discussion in Section 1.5, we known that Φ can aﬀect the quantum states of the electrons. Let’s ﬁrst see what Φ has to do with the Hall conductivity. Suppose that we slowly increase Φ from 0 to Φ0 = 2πℏ/e. Here “slowly” means that we take a time T ≫ 1/ωB. This induces an emf around the ring, E = −∂Φ/∂t = −Φ0/T . Let’s suppose that we can argue that n electrons are transferred from the inner circle to the outer circle in this time. This would result in a radial current Ir = −ne/T . ρxy = E form HΦ=0 = 1 2.2.3 An Aside: The Kubo Formula Before we get to anything related to topology, we ﬁrst need to lay some groundwork. Our task in this section will be to derive a formula for the Hall conductivity σxy in terms of quantum mechanical observables. The expression that we’re looking for is called the Kubo formula; it is part of more general story that goes by the name of linear response9. We’ll derive the Kubo formula for a general, multi-particle Hamiltonian H0 where the subscript 0 means that this is the unperturbed Hamiltonian before we turn on an electric ﬁeld. At this point, H0 could be that of many non-interacting particles each, for example, obeying the single-particle Hamiltonian (1.13) that we saw previously, or it could be something more complicated. Later, we’ll apply the Kubo formula both to Hamiltonians which describe particles moving in the continuum and to Hamiltonians that describe particles moving on a lattice. We denote the energy eigenstates of H0 as |m⟩, with H0|m⟩ = Em|m⟩. Now we add a background electric ﬁeld. We work in the gauge with At = 0 so that the electric ﬁeld can be written as E = −∂tA. The new Hamiltonian takes the form H = H0 + ∆H with ∆H = −J · A (2.8) where J is the quantum operator associated to the electric current. For the simple Hamiltonians that we considered in Section 1.4, J is equal (up to constants) to the me- chanical momentum π = p + eA = m ˙x which we deﬁned in equation (1.14). However, we’ll use more general deﬁnitions of J in what follows. At this point, there’s a couple of tricks that makes life simpler. First, we’re ultimately interested in applying a constant, DC electric ﬁeld. However, it turns out to be simpler to apply an AC electric ﬁeld, E(t) = Ee −iωt with frequency ω, and to then take the limit ω → 0. Second, it’s also somewhat simpler if we work with a complexiﬁed A. There’s nothing deep in this: it’s just easier to write e −iωt than, say, cos(ωt). Because all our calculations will be to linear order only, you can take the real part at any time. We then have A = E Our goal is to compute the current ⟨J⟩ that ﬂows due to the perturbation ∆H. We will assume that the electric ﬁeld is small and proceed using standard perturbation theory. We work in the interaction picture. This means that operators evolve as O(t) = V −1OV with V = e −iH0t/ℏ. In particular J, and hence ∆H(t) itself, both vary in time in this way. Meanwhile states |ψ(t)⟩, evolve by |ψ(t)⟩I = U(t, t0)|ψ(t0)⟩I where the unitary operator U(t, t0) is deﬁned as U(t, t0) = T exp (− i same frequency ω. This is the essence of linear response. The proportionality constant deﬁnes the frequency-dependent conductivity matrix σ(ω). The Hall conductivity is the oﬀ-diagonal part σxy(ω) = 1 Before we proceed, I should quickly apologise for being sloppy: the operator that we called J in (2.8) is actually the current rather than the current density. This means that the right-hand-side of (2.12) should, strictly speaking, be multiplied by the spatial area of the sample. It was simpler to omit this in the above derivation to avoid clutter. 2.2.4 The Role of Topology In this section, we describe a set-up in which we can see the deep connections between topology and the Hall conductivity. The set-up is closely related to the gauge-invariance argument that we saw in Section 2.2.2. However, we will consider the Hall system on a spatial torus T2. This can be viewed as a rectangle with opposite edges identiﬁed. We’ll take the lengths of the sides to be Lx and Ly. We thread a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B through the torus. The ﬁrst result we need is that B obeys the Dirac quantisation condition, BLxLy = 2πℏ It is clear from the expression above that the translation operators are not gauge invariant: they depend on our choice of A. We’ll choose Landau gauge Ax = 0 and Ay = Bx. With this choice, translations in the x direction are the same as those in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, while translations in the y direction pick up an extra phase. If we take a state ψ(x, y), translated around a cycle of the torus, it becomes Txψ(x, y) = ψ(x + Lx, y) = ψ(x, y) Tyψ(x, y) = e −ieBLyx/ℏ ψ(x, y + Ly) = ψ(x, y) Notice that we can see explicitly in the last of these equations that the wavefunction is not periodic in the naive sense in the y direction: ψ(x, y + Ly) ̸= ψ(x, y). Instead, the two wavefunctions agree only up to a gauge transformation. However, these equations are not consistent for any choice of B. This follows by comparing what happens if we translate around the x-cycle, followed by the y-cycle, or if we do these in the opposite order. We have TyTx = e −ieBLxLy/ℏ TxTy (2.14) Since both are required to give us back the same state, we must have eBLxLy The addition of the ﬂuxes adds an extra term Φx Φy Figure 21: to the Hamiltonian of the form (2.8), ∆H = − ∑ i=x,y JiΦi is itself a torus, T2 Φ, where the subscript is there to distinguish it from the spatial torus that we started with. We’ll introduce dimensionless angular variables, θi to parameterise this torus, θi = 2πΦi 2.3 Particles on a Lattice We saw in the previous section that there is a deep relationship between the Hall conductivity and a certain topological quantity called the Chern number that is related to the Berry phase. Here we’ll continue to explore this relationship but in the slightly diﬀerent context of particles moving on a lattice. The kind of ideas that we will describe have had a resurgence in recent years when it was realised that they are the key to understanding the subject of topological insulators. The advantage of looking at the particle on a lattice is that its momentum lies on a torus T2, known as the Brillouin zone. It is this torus that will allow us to ﬁnd interesting topological features. Indeed, it will play a very similar role to the parameter space T2 Φ that we met in the previous section. We’ll learn that one can deﬁne a Berry connection over the Brillouin zone and that the associated Chern number determines the Hall conductivity. 2.3.1 TKNN Invariants We’ll consider a particle moving on a rectangular lattice. The distance between lattice sites in the x-direction is a; the distance in the y-direction is b. Recall from earlier courses that the energy spectrum of this system form bands. Within each band, states are labelled by lattice momentum which takes values in the Brillouin zone, parame- terised by −π 2.3.3, it is also true (under certain assumptions) for particles moving in a lattice in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld where the torus in question is slightly diﬀerent concept called a magnetic Brillouin zone. (In this case, the periodicity conditions on uk are altered slightly but the formula we derive below still holds.) • Second, we’ll assume that the electrons are non-interacting. This means that we get the multi-particle spectrum simply by ﬁlling up the single-particle spectrum, subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. • Finally, we’ll assume that there is a gap between bands and that the Fermi energy EF lies in one of these gaps. This means that all bands below EF are completely ﬁlled while all bands above EF are empty. In band theory, such a situation describes an insulator. Whenever these three criteria are obeyed, one can assign an integer-valued topo- logical invariant C ∈ Z to each band. The topology arises from the way the phase of the states winds as we move around the Brillouin zone T2. This is captured by a U(1) Berry connection over T2, deﬁned by Ai(k) = −i⟨uk| ∂ The Chern number once again has a beautiful physical manifestation: it is related to the Hall conductivity σxy of a non-interacting band insulator by σxy = e 2 From now on it’s merely a question of doing the algebra. The Kubo formula becomes σxy = ie 2 2.3.2 The Chern Insulator Let’s look at an example. Perhaps surprisingly, the simplest examples of lattice models with non-vanishing Chern numbers don’t involve any magnetic ﬁelds at all. Such lattice models with ﬁlled bands are sometimes called Chern insulators, to highlight the fact that they do something interesting — like give a Hall response — even though they are insulating states. The simplest class of Chern insulators involve just two bands. The single-particle Hamiltonian written, written in momentum space, takes the general form ˜H(k) = ⃗E(k) · ⃗σ + ǫ(k)1 where k ∈ T2 and ⃗σ = (σ1, σ2, σ3) are the three Pauli matrices. The energies of the two states with momentum k are ǫ(k) ± | ⃗E(k)|. An insulator requires a gap between the upper and lower bands; we then ﬁll the states of the lower band. An insulator can only occur when ⃗E(k) ̸= 0 for all k. For any such model, we can introduce a unit three-vector, ⃗n(k) = ⃗E(k) kx ky Brillouin zone n Bloch sphere Figure 22: The map from Brillouin zone to Bloch sphere In the continuum limit, this becomes the Hamiltonian for a 2-component Dirac fermion in d = 2+1 dimensions. For this reason, this model is sometimes referred to as a Dirac- Chern insulator. For general values of m, the system is an insulator with a gap between the bands. There are three exceptions: the gap closes and the two bands touch at m = 0 and at m = ±2. As m varies, the Chern number — and hence the Hall conductivity — remains constant as long as the gap doesn’t close. A direct computation gives C =    −1 −2 < m < 0 1 0 < m < 2 0 |m| > 2 2.3.3 Particles on a Lattice in a Magnetic Field So far, we’ve discussed the integer quantum Hall eﬀect in lattice models but, perhaps surprisingly, we haven’t explicitly introduced magnetic ﬁelds. In this section, we de- scribe what happens when particles hop on a lattice in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. As we will see, the physics is remarkably rich. To orient ourselves, ﬁrst consider a particle hopping on two-dimensional square lattice in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld. We’ll denote the distance between adjacent lattice sites as a. We’ll work in the tight-binding approximation, which means that the position eigenstates |x⟩ are restricted to the lattice sites x = a(m, n) with m, n ∈ Z. The Hamiltonian is given by H = −t ∑ x ∑ j=1,2 |x⟩⟨x + ej| + h.c. (2.21) – 66 – where e1 = (a, 0) and e2 = (0, a) are the basis vectors of the lattice and t is the hopping parameter. (Note: t is the standard name for this parameter; it’s not to be confused with time!) The lattice momenta k lie in the Brillouin zone T2, parameterised by −π Magnetic Brillouin Zone We saw above that the key to ﬁnding topology in a lattice system was the presence of the Brillouin zone T2. Yet it’s not immediately obvious that the Brilliouin zone survives in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld. The existence of lattice momenta k are a consequence of the discrete translational invariance of the lattice. But, as usual, the choice of gauge breaks the explicit translational invariance of the Hamiltonian, even though we expect the underlying physics to be translational invariant. In fact, we’ll see that the interplay between lattice eﬀects and magnetic eﬀects leads to some rather surprising physics that is extraordinarily sensitive to the ﬂux Φ = Ba 2 that threads each plaquette. In particular, we can deﬁne a magnetic version of the Brillouin zone whenever Φ is a rational multiple of Φ0 = 2πℏ/e, Φ = p However, we can construct closely related operators that do commute with Tj and, hence, with the Hamiltonian. These are deﬁned by ˜Tj = ∑ x |x⟩e −iea ˜Aj(x)/ℏ⟨x + ej| where the new gauge ﬁeld ˜Aj is constructed to obey ∂k ˜Aj = ∂jAk. In Landau gauge, this means that we should take ˜A1 = Bx2 and ˜A2 = 0 When this holds, we have [Tj, ˜Tk] = [T † j , ˜Tk] = 0 ⇒ [H, ˜Tj] = 0 These operators commute with the Hamiltonian, but do not themselves commute. In- stead, they too obey the algebra (2.26). ˜T2 ˜T1 = e ieΦ/ℏ ˜T1 ˜T2 (2.27) This means that we could label states of the Hamiltonian by eigenvalues of, say, ˜T2 but not simultaneously by eigenvalues of ˜T1. This isn’t enough to construct a Brillouin zone. At this point, we can see that something special happens when the ﬂux is a rational multiple of Φ0, as in (2.25). We can now build commuting operators by [ ˜T n1 1 , ˜T n2 2 ] = 0 whenever p The algebraic structure above also tells us that any energy eigenvalue in a given band is q-fold degenerate. To see this, consider the state ˜T1|k⟩. Since [H, ˜T1] = 0, we know that this state has the same energy as |k⟩: H ˜T1|k⟩ = E(k) ˜T1|k⟩. But, using (2.27), the ky eigenvalue of this state is ˜T2( ˜T1|k⟩) = e ieΦ/ℏ ˜T1 ˜T2|k⟩ = e i(2πp/q+k2a) ˜T1|k⟩ We learn that |k⟩ has the same energy as ˜T1|k⟩ ∼ |(k1, k2 + 2πp/qa)⟩. The existence of a Brillouin zone (2.28) is the main result we need to discuss Hall conductivities in this model. However, given that we’ve come so far it seems silly not to carry on and describe what the spectrum of the Hamiltonian (2.23) looks like. Be warned, however, that the following subsection is a slight detour from our main goal. Hofstadter Butterﬂy To further understand the spectrum of the Hamiltonian (2.23), we’ll have to roll up our sleeves and work directly with the Schr¨odinger equation. Let’s ﬁrst look in position space. We can write the most general wavefunction as a linear combination of the position eigenstates |x⟩, |ψ⟩ = ∑ x ψ(x)|x⟩ The Schr¨odinger equation H|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩ then becomes an inﬁnite system of coupled, discrete equations [ ψ(x + e1) + ψ(x − e1) + e −i2πpx1/qaψ(x + e2) + e +i2πpx1/qaψ(x − e2)] = −E the magnetic Brillouin zone (2.28) is q times smaller. For this reason, we instead split the wavefunction (2.29) into q diﬀerent wavefunctions ˜ψr(k), with r = 1, . . . , q as ˜ψr(k) = ∑ x e −i(k1+2πpr/qa,k2)·x ψ(x) These contain the same information as (2.29), but now the argument k ranges over the magnetic Brillouin zone (2.28). Given the wavefunctions ˜ψr, we can always reconstruct ψ(x) by the inverse Fourier transform, ψ(x) = q∑ r=1 ∫ +π/qa −π/qa dk1 Figure 24: The Hofstadter butterﬂy Φ = pΦ0/q for which there exists a magnetic Brillouin zone. In this case, we can use the TKNN formula (2.20), but with the Chern number, which used to be deﬁned by integrating over the Brillouin zone, now arising by integrating over the magnetic Brillouin zone. The computation of the Chern numbers is not so straightforward. (You can ﬁnd it in the original paper of TKNN or, in more detail, in the book by Fradkin). Here we just state the answer. Even this is not totally straightforward. First consider the rth of the q bands. Then, to compute the Chern number, you are invited to solve the linear Diophantine equation r = qsr + ptr with |tr| ≤ q/2. The Chern number of the rth band is given by Cr = tr − tr−1 where t0 ≡ 0. If the ﬁrst r bands are ﬁlled, so that Er < EF < Er+1, then the Hall conductivity is given by σxy = e 2 is given by p/q = 11/7. Here the solutions to the Diophantine equation are (sr, tr) = (−3, 2), (5, −3), (2, −1), (−1, 1), (−4, 3), (4, −2), (1, 0). As we ﬁll consecutive bands, the second number tr in these pairs determines the Hall conductivity. We see that the Hall conductivity varies in an interesting way, sometimes negative and sometimes positive. – 73 – 3. The Fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect We’ve come to a pretty good understanding of the integer quantum Hall eﬀect and the reasons behind it’s robustness. Indeed, some of the topological arguments in the previous chapter are so compelling that you might think the Hall resistivity of an insulator has to be an integer. But each of these arguments has a subtle loophole and ultimately they hold only for non-interacting electrons. As we will now see, much more interesting things can happen when we include interactions. As with the integer quantum Hall eﬀect, these interesting things were ﬁrst discovered by experimenters rather than theorists. Indeed, it came as a great surprise to the community when, in 1982, plateaux in the Hall resistivity were seen at non-integer ﬁlling fractions. These plateaux were ﬁrst seen at ﬁlling fraction ν = 1 E E Figure 25: Density of states in the lowest Landau level without interactions Figure 26: ...and with interactions (with only a single gap at ν = 1/3 shown. electrons, where B is the magnetic ﬁeld and A is the area of the sample. This is a macroscopic number of electrons. The number of ways to ﬁll νN of these states is ( N νN) which, using Stirling’s formula, is approximately ( 1 in ρxy and the observed ρxx = 0. The bigger the gap, the more prominent the observed plateaux. This whole story requires the hierarchy of energy scales, ℏωB ≫ ECoulomb ≫ Vdisorder We will assume in what follows that this is the case. The question that we will focus on instead is: what is the physics of these fractional quantum Hall states? In what follows, we will take advantage of the diﬃculty of a direct theoretical attack on the problem to give us license to be more creative. As we’ll see, the level of rigour in the thinking about the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect is somewhat lower than that of the integer eﬀect. Instead, we will paint a compelling picture, using a number of diﬀerent approaches, to describe what’s going on. 3.1 Laughlin States The ﬁrst approach to the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect was due to Laughlin 14, who described the physics at ﬁlling fractions ν = 1 work with eigenstates of angular momentum. As we saw in Section 1.4, if we want to talk about angular momentum in Landau levels, we should work in symmetric gauge. The single particle wavefunctions in the lowest Landau level take the form (1.30) ψm ∼ zme −|z|2/4l2 B with z = x − iy. These states are localised on a ring of radius r = √ Laughlin’s proposal for the ground state wavefunction at ﬁlling fraction ν = 1/m is: ψ(zi) = ∏ i<j (zi − zj)me − ∑n i=1 |zi|2/4l2 B (3.3) Clearly this is anti-symmetric when m is an odd integer. For m an even integer, it can be thought of as a quantum Hall state for bosons. The pre-factor vanishes with a zero of order m whenever two electrons come together. Meanwhile, the exponential factor decreases quickly whenever the electrons get too far away from the origin. The wavefunction is peaked on conﬁgurations that balance these two eﬀects. Let’s ﬁrst show that the wavefunction has the desired ﬁlling fraction. To do this, focus on what the wavefunction is telling us about a single particle, say z1. The terms that depend on z1 in the pre-factor of the Laughlin wavefunction are ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m ∼ N∏ i=2(z1 − zi)m which tells us that there are m(N − 1) powers of z1. This, in turn, tells us that the maximum angular momentum of the ﬁrst particle is m(N − 1) and so its maximum radius is R ≈ √ to 1011 particles or so, the overlap is likely to be essentially zero. Instead, we should think of the Laughlin wavefunctions as states which lie in the same “universality class” as the true ground state. We will explain what this means in Section 3.2 but, roughly speaking, it is the statement that the states have the same fractional excitations and the same topological order as the true ground states. The Fully Filled Landau Level From the arguments above, the Laughlin state (3.3) with m = 1 should describe a completely ﬁlled Landau level. But this is something we can compute in the non- interacting picture and it provides a simple check on the Laughlin ansatz. Let us ﬁrst review how to build the many-particle wavefunction for non-interacting electrons. Suppose that N electrons sit in states ψi(x), with 1 = 1, . . . , N. Because the electrons are fermions, these states must be distinct. To build the many-particle wavefunction, we need to anti-symmetrise over all particles. This is achieved by the Slater determinant, ψ(xi) = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ψ1(x1) ψ1(x2) . . . ψ1(xN ) ψ2(x1) ψ2(x2) . . . ψ2(xN ) . . ψN (x1) ψN (x2) . . . ψN (xN ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ (3.5) We can now apply this to the lowest Landau level, with the single-particle states built up with successive angular momentum quantum numbers ψm(z) ∼ zm−1e −|z|2/4l2 B m = 1, . . . , N The resulting Slater determinant gives a state of the general form (3.2), with f (zi) given by a function known as the Vandermonde determinant, f (zi) = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ z0 1 z0 2 . . . z0 N z1 z2 . . . z3 . . zN −1 1 zN −1 2 . . . zN −1 N ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∏ i<j (zi − zj) To see that the determinant is indeed given by the product factor, note that ∏ i<j(zi−zj) is the lowest order, fully anti-symmetric polynomial (because any such polynomial must have a factor (zi−zj) for each pair i ̸= j). Meanwhile, the determinant is also completely – 79 – anti-symmetric and has the same order as the product factor. This ensures that they must be equal up to an overall numerical factor which can be checked to be 1. We see that m = 1 Laughlin state does indeed agree with the wavefunction for a completely ﬁlled lowest Landau level. The Competing Phase: The Wigner Crystal The Laughlin state should be thought of as a liquid phase of electrons. In fact, strictly speaking, it should be thought of as an entirely new phase of matter, distinguished by a property called topological order which we’ll discuss in Section 3.2.4. But, if you’re looking for a classical analogy, a liquid is the best. There is a competing solid phase in which the electrons form a two-dimensional triangular lattice, known as a Wigner crystal. Indeed, before the discovery of the quantum Hall eﬀect, it was thought that this would be the preferred phase of electrons in high magnetic ﬁelds. It’s now known that the Wigner crystal has lower energy than the Laughlin state only when the densities of electrons are low. It is observed for ﬁlling fractions ν ≲ 1 The key observation is that the expectation value (3.6) has the same formal structure as the kind of things we compute in classical statistical mechanics, with the denominator interpreted as the partition function, Z = N∏ i=1 d2zi P [zi] Indeed, we can make this analogy sharper by writing the probability distribution (3.7) so it looks like a Boltzmann distribution function, P [zi] = e −βU (zi) with βU(zi) = −2m ∑ i<j log (|zi − zj| The second term in (3.9) describes a neutralising background of constant charge. A constant background of charge density ρ0 would have electrostatic potential obeying −∇2φ = 2πρ0. Meanwhile, the second term in the potential obeys −∇2 ( |z|2 3.1.3 Toy Hamiltonians The Laughlin state (3.3) is not the exact ground state of the Hamiltonian with Coulomb repulsion. However, it is possible to write down a toy Hamiltonian whose ground state is given by the Laughlin state. Here we explain how to do this, using some tools which will also provide us with a better understanding of the general problem. Let’s go back to the problem of two particles interacting through a general central potential V (|r1 − r2|). As we saw in Section 3.1.1, in the lowest Landau level the eigenstates for any potential are the same, characterised by two non-negative integers: the angular momentum of the centre of mass M and the relative angular momentum m, |M, m⟩ ∼ (z1 + z2)M (z1 − z2)me −(|z1|2+|z2|2)/4l2 B We should take m odd if the particles are fermions, m even if they are bosons. The eigenvalues of the potential V are given by vm = ⟨M, m|V |M, m⟩ Given the eigenvalues vm, we can always reconstruct the potential V . In this lowest Landau level, there is no kinetic energy and the potential is the only contribution to the Hamiltonian. It’s useful to write it as H = ∑ m′ vm′Pm′ (3.13) where Pm is the operator which projects onto states in which the two particles have relative angular momentum m. Now we can just pick whatever vm we like to design our own Hamiltonians. Of course, they may not be very realistic when written in terms of V (r) but we won’t let that bother us too much. In this spirit, consider the choice vm′ = { 1 m ′ < m 0 m ′ ≥ m (3.14) This Hamiltonian means that you pay an energy cost if the relative angular momentum of the particles dips below some ﬁxed value m. But it costs you nothing to have a high angular momentum. In position space, the equation (3.12) tells us that there’s a ﬁnite energy cost if the particles get too close. Toy Hamiltonians for Many Particles We can also use the pseudopotentials to construct Hamiltonians for N particles. To do this, we introduce the operator Pm(ij). This projects the wavefunction onto the state in which the i th and jth particles have relative angular momentum m. We then construct the Hamiltonian as H = ∞∑ m′=1 ∑ i<j vm′Pm′(ij) (3.15) Note, however, that Pm(ij) and Pm(kj) do not commute with each other. This is what makes these many-particle Hamiltonians diﬃcult to solve. Now consider the many-particle Hamiltonian with vm′ given by (3.14). This time, you pay an energy cost whenever the relative angular momentum of any pair of particles is less than m. You can avoid this energy cost by including a factor of (zi − zj)m for each pair of particles, and writing down a wavefunction of the form ψ(zi) = s(zi) ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m e − ∑i |zi|2/4l2 B (3.16) where s(zi) can be any symmetric polynomial in the zi to preserve the statistics of the particles. All such wavefunctions have the vanishing energy. – 84 – So far this doesn’t pick out the Laughlin state, which has s(zi) = 1, as the ground state. But there is something special about this state: among all states (3.16), it is the most compact. Indeed, we saw in Section 3.1.1 that it takes up an area A = 2πmNl2 B. Any state with s(zi) ̸= 1 necessarily spreads over a larger spatial area. This means that the Laughlin wavefunction will be the ground state if we also add a conﬁning potential to the system. We can state this in a slightly diﬀerent way in terms of angular momentum. We know that states with higher angular momentum sit at larger radius. This means that we can take the total angular momentum operator J as a proxy for the conﬁning potential and consider the Hamiltonian H = m−1∑ m′=1 ∑ i<j Pm′(ij) + ωJ (3.17) The Laughlin wavefunction has the lowest energy: E0 = 1 We see that the electron density now vanishes at the point η. In other words, we have created a “hole” in the electron ﬂuid. More generally, we can introduce M quasi-holes in the quantum Hall ﬂuid at positions ηj with j = 1, . . . , M, with wavefunction ψM−hole(z; η) = M∏ j=1 N∏ i=1(zi − ηj) ∏ k<l(zk − zl)m e − ∑n i=1 |zi|2/4l2 B (3.19) The quasi-hole has a remarkable property: it carries a fraction of the electric charge of the electron! In our convention, the electron has charge −e; the quasi-hole has charge e ∗ = +e/m. A heuristic explanation of the fractional charge follows from noting that if we place m quasi-holes at the same point η then the wavefunction becomes ψm−hole(z; η) = N∏ i=1(zi − η)m ∏ k<l(zk − zl)m e − ∑n i=1 |zi|2/4l2 B If η was a dynamical variable, as opposed to a parameter, this is just the original wavefunction with an extra electron at position η. But because η is not a dynamical variable, but instead a parameter, it’s really a Laughlin wavefunction that describes a deﬁcit of a single electron at position η. This means that m holes act like a deﬁcit of a single electron, so a single quasi-hole is 1/m th of an electron. It should therefore carry charge +e/m. We can make exactly the same argument in the context of the plasma analogy for the quasi-hole wavefunction (3.18). The resulting plasma potential energy has an extra term compared to (3.9), U(zi) = −m 2 ∑ i<j log (|zi − zj| Quasi-Particles There are also excitations of the quantum Hall ﬂuid which carry charge e ∗ = −e/m, i.e. the same sign as the charge of an electron. These are quasi-particles. It seems to be somewhat harder to write down quasi-particle eigenstates compared to quasi-hole eigenstates. To see the problem, note that we want to increase the density of electrons inside the Hall ﬂuid and, hence, decrease the relative angular momentum of some pair of electrons. In the case of the quasi-hole, it was simple enough to increase the angular momentum: for example, for a hole at the origin we simply need to multiply the Laughlin wavefunction by the factor ∏ i zi. But now that we want to decrease the angular momentum, we’re not allowed divide by ∏ i zi as the resulting wavefunction is badly singular. Nor can we multiply by ∏ i ¯zi because, although this will decrease the angular momentum, the resulting wavefunction no longer sits in the lowest Landau level. Instead, a simple way to reduce the degree of a polynomial is to diﬀerentiate. This leads us to a candidate wavefunction for the quasi-particle, ψparticle(z, η) = [ N∏ i=1 ( 2 ∂ E k roton phonon E k magneto−roton Figure 27: A cartoon of the dispersion relation in superﬂuids... Figure 28: ...and for neutral excitations in quantum Hall ﬂuids. liquid to freeze to a solid – which, for the quantum Hall ﬂuid is a Wigner crystal. In both cases, this desire is ultimately thwarted by quantum ﬂuctuations. In the quantum Hall ﬂuid, the minimum occurs at momentum k ∼ 1/lB. In recent years, experiment has shown there is a rich structure underlying this. In particular, at other ﬁlling fractions (which we will discuss in Section 3.3) more than one minima is observed. We will not discuss these neutral excitations in these lectures. 3.2.1 Fractional Charge The existence of an object which carries fractional electric charge is rather surprising. In this section, we’ll explore some consequences. Hall Conductivity Revisited The most basic question we should ask of the Laughlin state is: does it reproduce the right Hall conductivity? To see that it does, we can repeat the Corbino disc argument of Section 2.2.2. As before, we introduce a ﬂux Φ(t) into the centre of the ring which we slowly increase from zero to Φ0. This induces a spectral ﬂow so that when we reach Φ = Φ0 we sit in a new eigenstate of the Hamiltonian in which the angular momentum of each electron increased by one. This is achieved by multiplying the wavefunction by the factor ∏ i zi. We could even do this procedure in the case where both the inner circle and the inserted solenoid become vanishingly small. In this case, multiplying by ∏ i zi gives us precisely the quasi-hole wavefunction (3.18) with η = 0. As an aside, note that we can also make the above argument above tells us that the quasi-hole wavefunction with η = 0 must be an eigenstate of the toy Hamiltonian (3.17), and indeed it is. (The wavefunction with η ̸= 0 is also an eigenstate in the presence of the conﬁning potential if we replace η → ηe iωt, which tells us that the conﬁning potential causes the quasi-hole to rotate). – 88 – We learn that as we increase Φ from zero to Φ0, a particle of charge −e/m is trans- ferred from the inner to the outer ring. This means that a whole electron is transferred only when the ﬂux is increased by mΦ0 units. The resultant Hall conductivity is σxy = e 2 3.2.2 Introducing Anyons We’re taught as undergrads that quantum particles fall into two categories: bosons and fermions. However, if particles are restricted to move in a two-dimensional plane then there is a loophole to the usual argument and, as we now explain, much more interesting things can happen 16. Let’s ﬁrst recall the usual argument that tells us we should restrict to boson and fermions. We take two identical particles described by the wavefunction ψ(r1, r2). Since the particles are identical, all probabilities must be the same if the particles are exchanged. This tells us that |ψ(r1, r2)|2 = |ψ(r2, r1)|2 so that, upon exchange, the wavefunctions diﬀer by at most a phase ψ(r1, r2) = e iπαψ(r2, r1) (3.21) Now suppose that we exchange again. Performing two exchanges is equivalent to a rotation, so should take us back to where we started. This gives the condition ψ(r1, r2) = e 2iπαψ(r1, r2) ⇒ e 2πiα = 1 This gives the two familiar possibilities of bosons (α = 0) or fermions (α = 1). So what’s the loophole in the above argument? The weak point is the statement that when we rotate two particles by 360◦ we should get back to where we came from. Why should this be true? The answer lies in thinking about the topology of the worldlines particles make in spacetime. In d = 3 spatial dimensions (and, if you’re into string theory, higher), the path that the pair of particles take in spacetime can always be continuously connected to the situation where the particles don’t move at all. This is the reason the resulting state should be the same as the one before the exchange. But in d = 2 spatial dimensions, this is not the case: the worldlines of particles now wind around each other. When particles are exchanged in an anti-clockwise direction, like this the worldlines get tangled. They can’t be smoothly continued into the worldlines of particles which are exchanged clockwise, like this: Each winding deﬁnes a diﬀerent topological sector. The essence of the loophole is that, after a rotation in the two-dimensions, the wavefunction may retain a memory of the path it took through the phase. This means that may have any phase α in (3.21). In fact, we need to be more precise: we will say that after an anti-clockwise exchange, the wavefunction is ψ(r1, r2) = e iπαψ(r2, r1) (3.22) After a clockwise exchange, the phase must be e −iπα. Particles with α ̸= 0, 1 are referred to as anyons. This whole subject usually goes by the name of quantum statistics or fractional statistics. But it has less to do with statistics and more to do with topology. The Braid Group Mathematically, what’s going on is that in dimensions d ≥ 3, the exchange of parti- cles must be described by a representation of the permutation group. But, in d = 2 dimensions, exchanges are described a representation of the braid group. Suppose that we have n identical particles sitting along a line. We’ll order them 1, 2, 3, . . . , n. The game is that of a street-magician: we shuﬄe the order of the parti- cles. The image that their worldlines make in spacetime is called a braid. We’ll only distinguish braids by their topological class, which means that two braids are consid- ered the same if we can smoothly change one into the other without the worldlines crossing. All such braidings form an inﬁnite group which we call Bn We can generate all elements of the braid group from a simple set of operations, R1, . . . , Rn−1 where Ri exchanges the i th and (i + 1)th particle in an anti-clockwise direction. The deﬁning relations obeyed by these generators are RiRj = RjRi |i − j| > 2 together with the Yang-Baxter relation, RiRi+1Ri = Ri+1RiRi+1 i = 1, . . . , n − 1 This latter relation is most easily seen by drawing the two associated braids and noting that one can be smoothly deformed into the other. – 91 – R1 R2 R1 R2 R1 R2 Figure 29: The left hand-side of the Yang-Baxter equation... Figure 30: ...is topologically equivalent to the right-hand side. In quantum mechanics, exchanges of particles act as unitary operators on the Hilbert space. These will form representations of the braid group. The kind of anyons that we described above form a one-dimensional representation of the braid group in which each exchange just gives a phase: Ri = e iπαi. The Yang-Baxter equation then requires e iπαi = e iπαi+1 which simply tells us that all identical particles must have the same phase. One dimensional representation of the braid group are usually referred to as Abelian anyons. As we’ll show below, these are the kind of anyons relevant for the Laughlin states. However, there are also more exotic, higher-dimensional representations of the braid group. These are called non-Abelian anyons. We will discuss some examples in Section 4. 3.2.3 Fractional Statistics We will now compute the quantum statistics of quasi-holes in the ν = 1/m Laughlin state. In passing, we will also provide a more sophisticated argument for the fractional charge of the quasi-hole. Both computations involve the Berry phase that arises as quasi-holes move 17. We consider a state of M quasi-holes which we denote as |η1, . . . , ηM ⟩. The wave- function is (3.19) ⟨z, ¯z|η1, . . . , ηM ⟩ = M∏ j=1 N∏ i=1(zi − ηj) ∏ k<l(zk − zl)m e − ∑n i=1 |zi|2/4l2 B However, whenever we compute the Berry phase, we should work with the normalised states. We’ll call this state |ψ⟩, deﬁned by |ψ⟩ = 1 Whenever such screening occurs, the impurities are eﬀectively hidden at distances much greater than λ. This means that the free energy of the plasma is independent of the positions of the impurities, at least up to exponentially small corrections. This free energy is, of course, proportional to log Z which is the thing we want to diﬀerentiate. However, there are two ingredients missing: the ﬁrst is the energy cost between the impurities and the constant background charge; the second is the Coulomb energy between the diﬀerent impurities. The correct potential energy for the plasma with M impurities should therefore be U(zk; ηi) = −m 2 ∑ k<l log (|zk − zl| η3 η2 η1 η3 η1 η2 Figure 31: The path taken to compute the fractional charge of the quasi-hole... Figure 32: ...and the path to compute the fractional statistics. and A¯ηi = + i Fractional Statistics To compute the statistics, we again take a particular quasi-hole — say η1 — on a journey, this time on a path C which encloses one other quasi-hole, which we’ll take to be η2. The phase is once again given by (3.27) where, this time, both terms in the expressions (3.25) and (3.26) for Aη and A¯η contribute. The second term once again gives the Aharonov-Bohm phase; the ﬁrst term tells us about the statistics. It is e iγ = exp (− 1 While the fractional charge of quasi-holes has been measured experimentally, a direct detection of their fractional statistics is more challenging. There have been a number of proposed (and performed) experiments using interferometry to demonstrate but their conclusions remain open to interpretation. A Slightly Diﬀerent Viewpoint There is a slightly diﬀerent way of presenting the calculation. It will oﬀer nothing new here, but often appears in the literature as it proves useful when discussing more complicated examples. The idea is that we consider a wavefunction that already has the interesting η dependence built in. So, instead of (3.19), we work with ψ = ∏ a<b(ηa − ηb)1/m N∏ a,i (zi − ηa) ∏ k<l(zk − zl)m e − ∑i |zi|2/4l2 B −∑ a |ηa|2/4ml2 B (3.30) This wavefunction is cooked up so that the associated probability distribution is given precisely by the partition function with energy (3.24) and hence has no dependence on η and ¯η. This means that the Berry connection for this wavefunction has only the second terms in (3.25) and (3.26), corresponding to the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect due to the background magnetic ﬁeld. The term in the Berry connection that was responsible for fractional statistics is absent. But this doesn’t mean that the physics has changed. Instead, this phase is manifest in the form of the wavefunction itself, which is no longer single-valued in ηa. Indeed, if η1 encircles a neighbouring point η2, the wavefunction pick up a phase e 2πi/m, so exchanging two quasi-holes gives the phase e iπ/m. Of course, this approach doesn’t alleviate the need to determine the Berry phase arising from the exchange. You still need to compute it to check that it is indeed zero. 3.2.4 Ground State Degeneracy and Topological Order In this section we describe a remarkable property of the fractional quantum Hall states which only becomes apparent when you place them on a compact manifold: the number of ground states depends on the topology of the manifold. As we now explain, this is intimately related to the existence of anyonic particles. Consider the following process on a torus. We create from the vacuum a quasi- particle – quasi-hole pair. We then separate this pair, taking them around one of the two diﬀerent cycles of the torus as shown in the ﬁgure, before letting them annihilate again. We’ll call the operator that implements this process T1 for the ﬁrst cycle and T2 for the second. – 97 – T1 T2 Figure 33: Taking a quasi-hole (red) and quasi-particle (blue) around one cycle of the torus Figure 34: ...or around the other. Now suppose we take the particles around one cycle and then around the other. Because the particles are anyons, the order in which we do this matters: there is a topological diﬀerence between the paths taken. Indeed, you can convince yourself that T1T2T −1 1 T −1 2 is equivalent to taking one anyon around another: the worldlines have linking number one. This means that the Ti must obey the algebra T1T2 = e 2πi/m T2T1 (3.31) But such an algebra of operators can’t be realised on a single vacuum state. This imme- diately tells us that the ground state must be degenerate. The smallest representation of (3.31) has dimension m, with the action T1|n⟩ = e 2πni/m|n⟩ T2|n⟩ = |n + 1⟩ The generalisation of this argument to a genus-g Riemann surface tells us that the ground state must have degeneracy m g. Notice that we don’t have to say anything about the shape or sizes of these manifolds. The number of ground states depends only on the topology! It is also possible to explicitly construct the analog of the Laughlin states on a torus in terms of Jacobi theta functions and see that there are indeed m such states. Before we proceed, we note that this resolves a puzzle. In Section 2.2.4, we described a topological approach to the integer quantum Hall eﬀect which is valid when space is a torus. With a few, very mild, assumptions, we showed that the Hall conductivity is equal to a Chern number and must, therefore, be quantised. In particular, this cal- culation made no assumption that the electrons were non-interacting: it holds equally well for strongly interacting many-body systems. However, one of the seemingly mild assumptions was that the ground state was non-degenerate. As we’ve seen, this is not true for fractional quantum Hall states, a fact which explains how these states avoid having integer Hall conductivity. – 98 – Topological Order We’ve seen in this section that the Laughlin states have a number of very special properties. One could ask: how can we characterise these states? This is an old and venerable question in condensed matter physics and, for most systems, has an answer provided by Landau. In Landau’s framework, diﬀerent states of matter are characterised by their symmetries, both those that are preserved by the ground state and those that are broken. This is described using order parameters of the kind that we met in the lectures on Statistical Physics when discussing phase transitions. However, the quantum Hall ﬂuids fall outside of this paradigm. There is no symmetry or local order parameter that distinguishes quantum Hall states. It turns out that there is a non-local order parameter, usually called “oﬀ-diagonal long-range order” and this can be used to motivate a Ginzburg-Landau-like description. We will describe this in Section 5.3.2 but, as we will see, it is not without its pitfalls. Instead, Wen 19 suggested that we should view quantum Hall ﬂuids as a new type of matter, characterised by topological order. The essence of the proposal is that quantum states can be characterised their ground state degeneracy and the way in which these states transform among themselves under operations like (3.31). 3.3 Other Filling Fractions So far, we have only described the quantum Hall states at ﬁlling fraction ν = 1/m. Clearly there are many more states that are not governed by the Laughlin wavefunction. As we now show, we can understand many of these by variants of the ideas above. A Notational Convention Before we proceed, let’s quickly introduce some new notation. All wavefunctions in the lowest Landau level come with a common exponential factor. It gets tiresome writing it all the time, so deﬁne ψ(z, ¯z) ∼ ˜ψ(z)e − ∑n i=1 |zi|2/4l2 B where ˜ψ(z) is a holomorphic function. In what follows we will often just write ˜ψ(z). Be warned that many texts drop the exponential factor in the wavefunctions but don’t give the resulting object a diﬀerent name. 3.3.1 The Hierarchy We saw in Section 3.2.1 how one can induce quasi-hole (or quasi-particle) states by introducing a local excess (or deﬁcit) of magnetic ﬁeld through a solenoid. We could also ask what happens if we change the magnetic ﬁeld in a uniform manner so that the system as a whole moves away from ν = 1/m ﬁlling. For deﬁniteness, suppose that we increase B so that the ﬁlling fraction decreases. It seems plausible that for B close to the initial Laughlin state, the new ground state of the system will contain some density of quasi-holes, arranged in some, perhaps complicated, conﬁguration. The key idea of this section is that these quasi-holes might themselves form a quantum Hall state. Let’s see how this would work. We know that Laughlin states take the form ˜ψ ∼ ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m where m is odd for fermions and even for bosons. What would a Laughlin state look like for anyons with positions ηi and statistical parameter α? To have the right statistics, the wavefunctions must take the form ˜ψ ∼ N∏ i<j (ηi − ηj)2p+α with p a positive integer. As we’ve seen, above the ν = 1/m state, quasi-holes have statistics α = 1/m while quasi-particles have statistics α = −1/m. It’s simple to repeat our previous counting of the ﬁlling fraction, although now we need to be more careful about what we’re counting. The maximum angular momentum of a given quasi- excitation is N(2p ± 1 Note that the ﬁlling fraction is decreased by quasi-holes and increased by quasi-particles. Let’s look at some simple examples. We start with the ν = 1/3 state. The p = 1 state for quasi-particles then gives ν = 2/5 which is one of the more prominent Hall plateaux. The p = 1 state for quasi-hole gives ν = 2/7 which has also been observed; while not particularly prominent, it’s harder to see Hall states at these lower ﬁlling fractions. Now we can go further. The quasi-objects in this new state can also form quantum Hall states. And so on. The resulting ﬁllings are given by the continuous fractions ν = 1 The idea of this section is to try to ﬁnd some new degrees of freedom — these are the “composite fermions”. However, for the most part these won’t be the degrees of freedom that are observed in the system. Instead, they play a role in the intermediate stages of the calculations. (There is an important exception to this statement which is the case of the half-ﬁlled Landau level, described in Section 3.3.3, where the observed excitations of the system are the composite fermions.) Usually it is diﬃcult to identify the emergent degrees of freedom, and it’s no diﬀerent here. We won’t be able to rigorously derive the composite fermion picture. Instead, we’ll give some intuitive and, in parts, hand-waving arguments that lead us to a cartoon description of the physics. But the resulting cartoon is impressively accurate. It gives ansatze for wavefunctions which are in good agreement with the numerical studies and it provides a useful and uniﬁed way to think about diﬀerent classes of quantum Hall states. We start by introducing the idea of a vortex. Usually a vortex is a winding in some complex order parameter. Here, instead, a vortex will mean a winding in the wavefunc- tion itself. Ultimately we will be interested in vortices in the Laughlin wavefunction, but to understand the key physics it’s simplest to revisit the quasi-hole whose wave- function includes the factor ∏ i (zi − η) Clearly the wavefunction now has a zero at the position η. This does two things. First, it depletes the charge there. This, of course, is what gives the quasi-hole its fractional charge e/m. But because the lowest Landau level wavefunction is holomorphic, there is also ﬁxed angular dependence: the phase of the wavefunction winds once as the position of any particle moves around η. This is the vortex. The winding of the wavefunction is really responsible for the Berry phase calculations we did in Section 3.2.3 to determine the fractional charge and statistics of the quasi- hole. Here’s a quick and dirty explanation. The phase of the wavefunction changes by 2π as a particle moves around the quasi-hole. Which means that it should also change by 2π when the quasi-hole moves around the particle. So if we drag the quasi-hole around N = νΦ/Φ0 particles, then the phase changes by γ = 2πN = νeΦ/ℏ. This is precisely the result (3.28) that we derived earlier. Meanwhile, if we drag one quasi-hole around a region in which there is another quasi-hole, the charge inside will be depleted by e/m, so the eﬀective number of particles inside is now N = νΦ/Φ0 −1/m. This gives an extra contribution to the phase γ = −2π/m which we associate the statistics of the quasi-holes: γ = 2πα = 2π/m so α = 1/m, reproducing our earlier result (3.29). We stress that all of these results really needed only the vortex nature of the quasi-hole. – 102 – Now let’s turn to the Laughlin wavefunction itself ˜ψm(z) ∼ ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m For now we focus on m odd so that the wavefunction is anti-symmetric and we’re dealing with a Hall state of fermions. One striking feature is that the wavefunction has a zero of order m as two electrons approach. This means that each particle can be thought of as m vortices. Of course, one of these zeros was needed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Moreover, we needed m zeros per particle to get the ﬁlling fraction right. But nothing forced us to have the other m − 1 zeros sitting at exactly the same place. This is something special about the Laughlin wavefunction. Motivated by this observation, we deﬁne a composite fermion to be an electron (which gives rise to one vortex due to anti-symmetry) bound to m − 1 further vortices. The whole thing is a fermion when m is odd. You’ll sometimes hear composite fermions described as electrons attached to ﬂux. We’ll describe this picture in the language of Chern-Simons theory in Section 5 but it’s not overly useful at the moment. In particular, it’s important to note that the composite fermions don’t carry real magnetic ﬂux with them. This remains uniform. Instead, as we will see later, they carry a diﬀerent, emergent ﬂux. Let’s try to treat this as an object in its own right and see what behaviour we ﬁnd. Consider placing some density n = νB/Φ0 of electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld and subse- quently attaching these vortices to make composite fermions. We will ﬁrst show that these composite fermions experience both a diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld B⋆ and diﬀerent ﬁlling fraction ν⋆ than the electrons. To see this, we repeat our Berry phase argument where we move the composite fermion along a path encircling an area A. The resulting Berry phase has two contributions, γ = 2π ( AB ν =1∗ ν=1/3 ν =2∗ ν=2/5 Figure 35: The composite fermion picture describes a hierarchy of plateaux around, starting with ν = 1/3, in terms of the integer quantum Hall eﬀect for electrons bound to two vortices. equivalent) way: we say that the composite fermions experience a diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld which we call B⋆. The Aharonov-Bohm phase should then be γ = 2πAB⋆ Figure 36: The fractional Hall plateaux....again the ﬁrst ν⋆ Landau levels to get an integer quantum Hall eﬀect for composite fermions with ν⋆ > 1. (The Landau levels for composite fermions are sometimes referred to Λ levels.) Then we ﬁnd ﬁlling fractions that are diﬀerent from the Laughlin states. For example, if we pick m = 3, then the sequence of states arising from (3.36) is ν = 1/3, 2/5, 3/7, 4/9, . . .. These is the same sequence that we saw in the hierarchy construction and is clearly visible in the data shown in the ﬁgure. Inspired by the form of (3.37), we will write down a guess for the wavefunction, usually referred to as Jain states, ˜ψν(z) = PLLL [ ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m−1 Ψν⋆(z, ¯z) ] (3.38) Here Ψν⋆ is the wavefunction for ν⋆ ∈ Z fully-ﬁlled Landau levels while the ∏ (zi−zj)m−1 factor attaches the (m − 1) vortices to each electron. The wavefunction Ψν⋆ can be easily constructed by a Slater determinant of the form (3.5) except that, this time, we run into a problem. The electrons have ﬁlling fraction ν < 1 and so are supposed to lie in the lowest Landau level. Meanwhile, the integer quantum Hall states Ψν⋆ are obviously not lowest Landau level wavefunctions: they depend on ¯zi as well as zi. This is what the mysterious symbol PLLL is doing in the equation (3.38): it means “project to the lowest Landau level”. – 105 – Operationally, PLLL is deﬁned by moving all factors of ¯zi in [. . .] to the left. We then make the substitution ¯zi → 2l2 B ∂ According to this, the composite fermions shouldn’t feel a magnetic ﬁeld. That seems kind of miraculous. Looking at the data, we see that the ν = 1/2 quantum Hall state occurs at a whopping B ≈ 25 T or so. And yet this cartoon picture we’ve built up of composite fermions suggests that the electrons dress themselves with vortices so that they don’t see any magnetic ﬁeld at all. So what happens to these fermions? Well, if they’re on experiencing a magnetic ﬁeld, then they must pile up and form a Fermi sea. The resulting state is simply the compressible state of a two-dimensional metal. The wavefunction describing a Fermi sea of non-interacting fermions is well known. If we have N particles, with position ri, and the N lowest momentum modes are ki, then we place particles in successive plane-wave states e iki·ri and subsequently anti-symmetrise over particles. The resulting slater determinant wavefunction is ψFermi Sea = det (e iki·rj ) (3.41) The Fermi momentum is deﬁned to be the highest momentum i.e. kF ≡ |kN |. Once again, this isn’t a lowest Landau level wavefunction since, in complex coordinates, k · r = 1 cleanest demonstration is then to look at excitations above the Fermi surface. Using simple classical physics, we expect that the particles will move in the usual cyclotron circles, with x + iy = Re iωt where ω = eB⋆/m ⋆. The slight problem here is that we don’t know m ⋆. But if we diﬀerentiate, we can relate the radius of the circle to the momentum of the particle which, in the present case, we can take to be ℏkF . We then get the simple prediction R = ℏkF d k −e +e d k +e/2−e/2 Figure 37: The composite fermion is a dipole like this. Figure 38: Or perhaps like this. As with much of the discussion on composite fermions, the ideas above are no more than suggestive. But they have turned out to be useful. Now that we have an extended object, thinking in terms of a reduced magnetic ﬁeld is perhaps not so useful since the two ends can experience diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds. Instead, we can return to our original quasi-hole interpretation in which the vortices carry charge. One end then has two vortices, each with charge +e/2. The other end consists of an electron with charge −e. The net result is the symmetric, dipole conﬁguration shown in the ﬁgure with a dipole moment ⃗d, with magnitude proportional to ⃗k, such that ⃗d ·⃗k = 0 and | ⃗d| = ekl2 B. The energy needed to produce such a dipole separation now comes entirely from the Coulomb interaction V (|d|) which we now interpret as V (|⃗k|). On rotational grounds, the expansion of the potential energy should start with a term ∼ | ⃗d|2 for small ⃗d. This is the origin of the kinetic energy. The electron will drift along equipotentials of V |⃗k|), while the vortices experience it as a magnetic ﬁeld. The net eﬀect is that both ends of the dipole move in the same direction, ⃗k with velocity ∂V /∂⃗k as expected. We note that, more recently it’s been suggested that it’s better to think of the displacement as acting on just one of the two vortices bound to the electron 22. This can be justiﬁed on the grounds that each electron always accompanies a single zero because of Pauli exclusion. The end with a single vortex has charge +e/2, while the end that consists of an electron bound to a single vortex has charge −e + e/2 = −e/2. We get the same qualitative physics as before, but with | ⃗d| = ekl2 B/2 as shown in the ﬁgure. The only diﬀerence between these two possibilities lies in the Berry phase that the dipole acquires as it moves around the Fermi surface. This helps resolve an issue about particle-hole symmetry at half-ﬁlling which we will discuss brieﬂy in Section 5.3.3. 3.3.4 Wavefunctions for Particles with Spin Until now we’ve neglected the role of spin in the quantum Hall states, arguing that the Zeeman eﬀect is suﬃcient to polarise the spin of the electron. Here we describe a simple generalisation of the Laughlin wavefunction for particles that carry spin 23. We split our particles into two sets. The ﬁrst set has spin-up, with positions z1, . . . zN ↑. The second set has spin-down, with positions w1, . . . , wN ↓. Note that each electron has a ﬁxed spin which is an eigenvalue of Sz: we don’t allow the spin to ﬂuctuate, nor do we allow the spin to be misaligned from the z-axis. We’ll relax this condition shortly. If the two sets of particles didn’t talk to each other, we can trivially take the product of two Laughlin wavefunctions, ψ(z, w) = N ↑ ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m1 N ↓ ∏ k<l(wk − wl)m2 e − ∑ |zi|2/4l2 B −∑ |ωi|2/4l2 B Such a state would have ﬁlling fraction ν↑ = 1/m1 and ν↓ = 1/m2, giving total ﬁlling fraction ν = ν↑ + ν↓. Clearly there’s nothing new in these wavefunctions. What’s more, they miss the interesting physics. As we saw above, the Coulomb interactions are what drives the state to the Laughlin wavefunction. But these Coulomb interactions are blind to spin. They must also give correlations between the two sets of electrons. Halperin proposed to capture this with the simple wavefunction ˜ψ(z, w) = N ↑ ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m1 N ↓ ∏ k<l(wk − wl)m2 ∏ i,k (zi − wk)n (3.43) where now ˜ψ means that we’re dropping the exponential factors for both variables. This set of wavefunctions are characterised by the three integers and usually referred to as the (m1, m2, n) states, or sometimes as Halperin states. These wavefunctions have very similar properties to the Laughlin states. In particu- lar, the relative angular momentum is never less than m1 between two spin-up particles, never less than m2 for two down-spin particles and never less than n for particles of opposite spin. This kind of intuition allows us to build toy Hamiltonians, similar to those of Section 3.1.3, which have these wavefunctions as ground states. Let’s now compute the ﬁlling fractions of these wavefunctions. Following our calcu- lation in Section 3.1.1, we’ll look at the highest power of a given spin-up electron, say z1. We see that this has maximum angular momentum m1N ↑ + nN ↓ and hence ﬁlls out an area A ↑ = 2π(m1N ↑ + nN ↓)l2 B Meanwhile, the same computation for the spin-down particles gives us the area A ↓ = 2π(m2N ↓ + nN ↑)l2 B If we want to focus on the places where both spin-up and spin-down particles intermin- gle, we should take A ↑ = A ↓. Clearly for a given state (m1, m2, n) this puts a constraint on, say, N↓ given N↑. The ﬁlling fractions are then ν↑ = N ↑ Given these states, we could now start to construct quasi-hole and quasi-particle states for these multi-component wavefunctions. The quasi-holes in the (m, m, n) state turn out to have charge e/(m + n). We’ll postpone this discussion to Section 5, where we’ll see that we can describe both the (m1, m2, n) states and the Jain states of Section 3.3.2 in a uniﬁed framework. Putting Spin Back In So far, we’ve been calling the diﬀerent sets of particles “spin-up” and “spin-down”, but the wavefunctions (3.43) don’t really carry the spin information. For example, there’s no way to measure the spin of the particle in along the x-axis, as opposed to the z- axis. However, there’s a simple way to remedy this. We just add the spin information, σ =↑ or ↓ for each particle and subsequently anti-symmetrise (for fermions) over all N = N↑ + N↓ particles. For (m, m, n) states, with m > n and N ↑ = N ↓ = N/2, this is written as ˜ψ(z, σ) = A   N∏ i<j (zi − zj)n ∏ 1<i<j<N/2 (zi − zj)m−n ∏ N/2+1<k<l<N (zk − zl)m−n | ↑ . . . ↑ ↓ . . . ↓⟩   where A stands for anti-symmetrise over all particles, exchanging both positions and spins. Since the spin state above is symmetric in the ﬁrst N/2 spins and the second N/2 spins, we must have m odd. (For bosons we could symmetrise over all particles providing m is even). A particularly interesting class of wavefunction are spin singlets. Given a bunch of N spins, one simple way to form a spin singlet state is to choose a pairing of particles — say (12) and (34) and so on — and, for each pair, forming the spin singlet |12⟩ = 1 (n + 1, n + 1, n) Halperin state by writing ˜ψ(z, w, σ) = A [ N∏ i<j (zi − zj)n ∏ i<j odd (zi − zj) ∏ k<l even(zk − zl) |12⟩|34⟩ . . . |N − 1, N⟩ ] It can be seen to be a spin singlet because the last two factors are just Slater determi- nants for spin up and spin down respectively, which is guaranteed to form a spin singlet. Meanwhile, the ﬁrst factor is a symmetric polynomial and doesn’t change the spin. A stronger statement, which would require somewhat more group theory to prove, is that the (n + 1, n + 1, n) Halperin states are the only spin singlets. There is much more interesting physics in these quantum Hall states with spin. In particular, for the case m = n, the Halperin states become degenerate with others in which the spins do not lie in along the z-direction and the spin picks up its own dynamics. The resulting physics is much studied and associated to the phenomenon of quantum Hall ferromagnetism – 113 – 4. Non-Abelian Quantum Hall States The vast majority of the observed quantum Hall plateaux Figure 39: sit at fractions with odd denominator. As we’ve seen above, this can be simply understood from the fermonic nature of electrons and the corresponding need for anti- symmetric wavefunctions. But there are some excep- tions. Most prominent among them is the very clear quantum Hall state observed at ν = 5/2, shown in the ﬁgure 25. A similar quantum Hall state is also seen at ν = 7/2. The ν = 5/2 state is thought to consist of fully ﬁlled lowest Landau levels for both spin up and spin down electrons, followed by a spin-polarised Landau level at half ﬁlling. The best candidate for this state turns out to have a number of extraordinary properties that opens up a whole new world of interesting physics involving non-Abelian anyons. The purpose of this section is to describe this physics. 4.1 Life in Higher Landau Levels Until now, we’ve only looked at states in the lowest Landau level. These are charac- terised by holomorphic polynomials and, indeed, the holomorphic structure has been an important tool for us to understand the physics. Now that we’re talking about quan- tum Hall states with ν > 1, one might think that we lose this advantage. Fortunately, this is not the case. As we now show, if we can neglect the coupling between diﬀerent Landau level then there’s a way to map the physics back down to the lowest Landau level. The ﬁrst point to make is that there is a one-to-one map between Landau levels. We saw this already in Section 1.4 where we introduced the creation and annihilation operators a † and a which take us from one Landau level to another. Hence, given a one-particle state in the lowest Landau level, |m⟩ ∼ zme −|z|2/4l2 B we can construct a corresponding state a † n|m⟩ in the n th Landau level. (Note that the counting is like the British way of numbering ﬂoors rather than the American: if you go up one ﬂight of stairs you’re on the ﬁrst ﬂoor or, in this case, the ﬁrst Landau level). Similarly, a state of two particles in the lowest Landau level decomposes into a centre of mass part and a relative part, written as |M, m⟩ ∼ (zi + zj)M (zi − zj)me −(|zi|2+|zj|2)/4l2 B We can also again construct the corresponding state a † n 1 a † n 2 |M, m⟩ in which each par- ticle now sits in the n th Landau level. We’ve already seen in Section 3.1.3 that, if we focus attention to the lowest Landau level, then the interactions between particles can be characterised by pseudopotentials, deﬁned by (3.11) vm = ⟨M, m|V (|ri − rj|)|M, m⟩ interactions that the electrons experience. Our ﬁrst task, then, is to write down the quantum Hall state for electrons at half ﬁlling. In fact, we’ve already seen an example of this: the (3, 3, 1) state described in Section 3.3.4. But, as we now explain, there is also another, much more interesting candidate. 4.2 The Moore-Read State The Moore-Read, or Pfaﬃan state describes an even number of particles, N, with ﬁlling fraction ν = 1/m. It is given by 26 ˜ψM R(z) = Pf ( 1 where the sum is over all σ ∈ SN , the symmetric group, and sign(σ) is the signature of σ. For example, if we have four particles then Pf ( 1 The View from the Composite Fermion The Moore-Read wavefunction is crying out to be interpreted in terms of composite fermions. In this language, the ∏ (zi − zj)m factor attaches m vortices to each electron. If m is even, then the underlying electron was a fermion. Attaching an even number of vortices leaves it as a fermion. In contrast, if m was odd then the underlying “electron” was a boson. Attaching an odd number of vortices now turns it into a fermion. Either, way, the combined object of electron + m vortices is a fermion. We saw in Section 3.3.3 that for m = 2, attaching the vortices results in a composite fermion in an eﬀectively vanishing magnetic ﬁeld. The question is: how should we interpret the Pfaﬃan in this language? In fact, there is a very natural interpretation: the Moore-Read state describes composite fermions which pile up to form a Fermi liquid and subsequently suﬀer a BCS pairing instability to superconductivity More meat can be put on this proposal. Here we skip the meat and oﬀer only some pertinent facts 27. In a conventional superconductor, the spins of the electrons form a spin singlet. This provides the necessary anti-symmetry of the wavefunction so that the angular momentum part is symmetric. The simplest choice is that the electron pair condense in the s-wave. However, our composite fermions all have the same spin so the anti-symmetry must now come from the angular momentum. The simplest choice is now that the composite fermion pair condenses in the p-wave. In fact, the relevant choice of spherical harmonics gives what’s known as a px + ipy superconductor. The appropriate BCS wavefunction for such a superconductor, in the weak pairing limit, indeed takes the form of the Pfaﬃan factor in (4.2). 4.2.1 Quasi-Holes We can now look at excitations of the Moore-Read state. We will focus on quasi-holes. One obvious thing to try is to simply repeat what we did for the Laughlin quasi-hole (3.18) and propose the wavefunction, ˜ψ(z) = ∏ k (zk − η) Pf ( 1 However, in the Moore-Read state (much) more interesting things can happen. The Laughlin quasi-hole, described by (4.5), can itself split into two! We describe this by building the positions of the new objects into the Pfaﬃan part of the wavefunction like so: ˜ψ(z) = Pf ((zi − η1)(zj − η2) + (zj − η1)(zi − η2) Indeed, (4.7) is a ﬁne quasi-hole state. But it’s not unique: there was an arbitrariness in the way split the four quasi-particles into the two groups (12) and (34). This makes it look as if there are two further states that we can write down, ˜ψ(13),(24)(z) and ˜ψ(14),(23)(z) So it looks as if there are three states describing 4 quasi-holes. But this isn’t right. It turns out that these states are not all linearly independent. It’s a little ﬁddly to derive the linear dependence of quasi-hole states, but it’s impor- tant. Here we’ll derive the result for the simplest case of 4 quasi-holes and then just state the result for the general case of 2n quasi-holes 29. The ﬁrst step is to note the relation (z1 − η1)(z1 − η2)(z2 − η3)(z2 − η4) − (z1 − η1)(z1 − η3)(z2 − η4)(z2 − η2) + (1 ↔ 2) = (z1 − z2)2(η1 − η4)(η2 − η3) (4.8) which is simplest to see by noting that the left-hand side indeed vanishes on the roots. To save space, we introduce some new notation. Deﬁne ηαβ = ηα − ηβ and (12, 34) ≡ (z1 − η1)(z1 − η2)(z2 − η3)(z2 − η4) + (1 ↔ 2) So that (4.8) reads (12, 34) − (13, 24) = (z1 − z2)2η14η23 Then, using the deﬁnition of the Pfaﬃan (4.3), we have Pf (13),(24)(z) = A ((13, 24) factor which vanishes. Indeed, for all the remaining terms we have to anti-symmetrise a polynomial which is linear in each factor and this too vanishes. We’re left with Pf (13),(24)(z) = Pf (12),(34)(z) − A ( (z1 − z2)η14η23 (12, 34)η14η23 A moments thought shows that the counting (4.10) is very peculiar. We’re quite used to the Hilbert space for a group of particles having a degeneracy when each particle has an internal degree of freedom. For example, if we have N particles each of spin-1/2 then the total Hilbert space has dimension 2N . But that can’t be what’s going on with our quasi-holes. We have 2n quasi-holes but an internal Hilbert space of dimension 2n−1. Even ignoring the factor of 2−1 for now, we have many fewer states than could be accounted for by each particle having it’s own internal degree of freedom. This simple observation is really the key bit of magic captured by the Moore-Read excitations. The “internal” degrees of freedom described by the Hilbert space of di- mension 2n−1 are not associated to any individual quasi-hole and they can’t be seen by looking at any local part of the wavefunction. Instead they are a property of the entire collection of particles. It is information stored non-locally in the wavefunction. Quasi-Holes are Non-Abelian Anyons Let’s now think about what happens when the quasi-holes are exchanged. As we have seen, if we have 2n quasi-holes then there are 2n−1 possible ground states. When we take any closed path in the conﬁguration space of quasi-holes, the state of the system can come back to itself up to a unitary U(2n−1) rotation. This is an example of the non-Abelian Berry holonomy discussed in Section 1.5.4. The quasi-holes are referred to as non-Abelian anyons. (The original suggested name was “non-Abelions”, but it doesn’t seem to have caught on.) Our task is to ﬁgure out the unitary matrices associated to the exchange of particles. Conceptually, this task is straightforward. We just need to construct an orthonormal set of 2n−1 wavefunctions and compute the non-Abelian Berry connection (1.52). In practice, that’s easier said than done. Recall that in the computation of the Berry connection for Laughlin quasi-holes we relied heavily on the plasma analogy. This suggests that to make progress we would need to develop a similar, but more involved, plasma analogy for the Moore-Read state. The resulting calculations are quite long30. The good news is that although the calculation is somewhat involved, the end result is quite simple However, this also suggests that there might be a more physical way to get to this result. And, indeed there is: it involves returning to the composite fermion picture. 4.2.2 Majorana Zero Modes Recall that, at ν = 1/2, composite fermions are immune to the background magnetic ﬁeld and instead form a Fermi sea. The Moore-Read state arises when these composite fermions pair up and condense, forming a p-wave superconductor. This viewpoint provides a very simple way to understand the non-Abelian statistics. Moreover, the results are general and apply to any other (px + ipy) superconductor. The unconventional superconductor Sr2RuO4 is thought to fall into this class, and it may be posisible to construct these states in cold atom systems. (A warning: this last statement is usually wheeled out for almost anything that people don’t really know how to build.) To proceed, we will need a couple of facts about the p-wave superconducting state that I won’t prove. The ﬁrst is that, in common with all superconductors, there are vortices, in which the phase of the condensate winds around the core. Because the composite electrons condense in pairs, the simplest vortex can carry Φ0/2e ﬂux as opposed to Φ0/e. For this reason, it’s sometimes called a half-vortex, although we’ll continue to refer to it simply as the vortex. This will be our quasi-hole. The second fact that we’ll need is the crucial one, and is special to px + ipy super- conductors. The vortices have zero modes. These are solutions to the equation for the fermion ﬁeld in the background of a vortex. They can be thought of as a fermion bound to the vortex. Importantly, for these p-wave superconductors, this zero mode is Majorana31. A Hilbert Space from Majorana Zero Modes To explain what a Majorana mode means, we’ll have to work in the language of creation and annihilation operators for particles which is more familiar in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory. We start by reviewing these operators for standard fermions. We deﬁne c† i to be the operator that creates an electron (or, more generally a fermion). Here the index i labels any other quantum numbers of the electron, such as momentum or spin. Meanwhile, the conjugate operator ci annihilates an electron or, equivalently, creates a hole. (In high-energy physics, we’d call this an anti-particle.) These fermionic creation and annihilation operators obey {ci, c† j} = δij and {ci, cj} = {c† i , c† j} = 0 (4.11) which can be thought of as the manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle. A Majorana particle is a fermion which is its own anti-particle. It can be formally created by the operator γi = ci + c† i (4.12) which clearly satisﬁes the condition γi = γ† i . From (4.11), we see that these Majorana operators satisfy {γi, γj} = 2δij (4.13) This is known as the Cliﬀord algebra. While it’s simple to write down the equation (4.12), it’s much harder to cook up a physical system in which these excitations exist as eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. For example, if we’re talking about real electrons then c† creates a particle of charge −e while c creates a hole of charge +e. This means that γ creates a particle which is in a superposition of diﬀerent charges. Usually, this isn’t allowed. However, the environment in a superconductor makes it possible. Electrons have paired up into Cooper pairs to form a boson which subsequently condenses. The ground state then contains a large reservoir of particles which can eﬀectively absorb any ±2e charge. This means that in a superconductor, charge is conserved only mod 2. The electron and hole then have eﬀectively the same charge. Suppose now that we have 2n well-separated vortices, each with their Majorana zero mode γi. (We’ll see shortly why we restrict to an even number of vortices.) We ﬁx the positions of the vortices. What is the corresponding Hilbert space? To build the Hilbert space, we need to take two Majorana modes and, from them, reconstruct a complex fermion zero mode. To do this, we make an arbitrary choice to pair the Majorana mode associated to one vortex with the Majorana mode associated to a diﬀerent vortex. There’s no canonical way to pair vortices like this but any choice we make will work ﬁne. For now, let’s pair (γ1, γ2) and (γ3, γ4) and so on. We then deﬁne the complex zero modes Ψk = 1 state |0⟩ which obeys Ψk|0⟩ = 0 for all k. We then construct the full Hilbert space by acting with successive creation operators, Ψ† k to get |0⟩ Ψ† k|0⟩ Ψ† kΨ† l |0⟩ (4.15) . Ψ† 1 . . . Ψ† n|0⟩ The sector with p excitations has (p n ) possible states. The dimension of the full Hilbert space is dimension of Hilbert space = 2n Note, ﬁrstly, that the same comments we made for quasi-hole wavefunctions also apply here. There’s no way to think of this Hilbert space as arising from local degrees of freedom carried by each of the 2n vortices. Indeed, one advantage of this approach is that it demonstrates very clearly the non-local nature of the Hilbert space. Each individual vortex carries only a Majorana zero mode. But a single Majorana zero mode doesn’t buy you anything: you need two of them to form a two-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimension of the Hilbert space we’ve found here is twice as big as the dimension (4.10) that comes from counting linearly independent wavefunctions. But it turns out that there’s a natural way to split this Hilbert space into two. As we’ll see shortly, the braiding of vortices mixes states with an even number of Ψ† excitations among themselves. Similarly, states with an odd number of Ψ† excitations also mix among themselves. Each of these Hilbert spaces has dimension 2n−1. The linearly independent quasi-hole excitations (4.9) can be thought of as spanning one of these smaller Hilbert spaces. Braiding of Majorana Zero Modes The Majorana zero modes give us a simple way to construct the Hilbert space for our non-Abelian anyons. They also give us a simple way to see the braiding32. Recall from Section 3.2.2 that the braid group is generated by Ri, with i = 1, . . . , 2n− 1, which exchanges the i th vortex with the (i+1)th vortex in an anti-clockwise direction. The action of this braiding on the Majorana zero modes is Ri :    γi → γi+1 γi+1 → −γi γj → γj j ̸= i, i + 1 where the single minus sign corresponds to the fact that the phase of a Majorana fermion changes by 2π as it encircles a vortex. We want to represent this action by a unitary operator — which, with a slight abuse of notation we will also call Ri — such that the eﬀect of a braid can be written as RiγjR† i . It’s simple to write down such an operator, Ri = exp (π Four Quasi-holes For four vortices, we have four states: |0⟩, Ψk|0⟩ for k = 1, 2, and Ψ† 1Ψ† 2|0⟩. Meanwhile, there three generators of the braid group. For the exchanges 1 ↔ 2 and 3 ↔ 4, the corresponding operators involve only a single complex fermion, R1 = 1 The non-Abelian anyons that we have described above are called Ising anyons. The name is strange as it’s not at all clear at this stage what these anyons have to do with the Ising model. We will brieﬂy explain the connection in Section 6.3. Relationship to SO(2n) Spinor Representations The discussion above has a nice interpretation in terms of the spinor representation of the rotation group SO(2n). This doesn’t add anything new to the physics, but it’s simple enough to be worth explaining. As we already mentioned, the algebra obeyed by the Majorana zero modes (4.13) is called the Cliﬀord algebra. It is well known to have a unique irreducible representation of dimension 2n. This can be built from 2 × 2 Pauli matrices, σ1, σ2 and σ3 by γ1 = σ1 ⊗ σ3 ⊗ . . . ⊗ σ3 γ2 = σ2 ⊗ σ3 ⊗ . . . σ3 . γ2k−1 = 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ σ1 ⊗ σ3 ⊗ . . . ⊗ σ3 γ2k = 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ σ2 ⊗ σ3 ⊗ . . . ⊗ σ3 . γ2n−1 = 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ σ1 γ2n = 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ σ2 The Pauli matrices themselves obey {σa, σb} = 2δab which ensures that the gamma- matrices deﬁned above obey the Cliﬀord algebra. From the Cliﬀord algebra, we can build generators of the Lie algebra so(2n). The rotation in the (x i, x j) plane is generated by the anti-symmetric matrix Tij = i The spinor representation (4.19) is not irreducible. To see this, note that there is one extra gamma matrix, γ2n+1 = σ3 ⊗ σ3 ⊗ . . . ⊗ σ3 which anti-commutes with all the others, {γ2n+1, γi} = 0 and hence commutes with the Lie algebra elements [γ2n+1, Tij] = 0. Further, we have (γ2n+1)2 = 12n, so γ2n+1 has eigenvalues ±1. By symmetry, there are n eigenvalues +1 and n eigenvalues −1. We can then construct two irreducible chiral spinor representations of so(2n) by projecting onto these eigenvalues. These are the representation of non-Abelian anyons that act on the Hilbert space of dimension 2n−1. This, then, is the structure of Ising anyons, which are excitations of the Moore-Read wavefunction. The Hilbert space of 2n anyons has dimension 2n−1. The act of braiding two anyons acts on this Hilbert space in the chiral spinor representation of SO(2n), rotating by an angle π/2 in the appropriate plane. 4.2.3 Read-Rezayi States In this section, we describe an extension of the Moore-Read states. Let’s ﬁrst give the basic idea. We’ve seen that the m = 1 Moore-Read state has the property that it vanishes only when three or more particles come together. It can be thought of as a zero-energy ground state of the simple toy Hamiltonian, H = A ∑ i<j<k δ2(zi − zj)δ2(zj − zk) This suggests an obvious generalisation to wavefunctions which only vanish when some group of p particles come together. These would be the ground states of the toy Hamiltonian H = A ∑ i1<i2<...<ip δ2(zi1 − zi2)δ2(zi2 − zi3) . . . δ2(zip−1 − zip) The resulting wavefunctions are called Read-Rezayi states. To describe these states, let us ﬁrst re-write the Moore-Read wavefunction in a way which allows a simple generalisation. We take N particles and arbitrarily divide them up into two groups. We’ll label the positions of the particles in the ﬁrst group by v1, . . . , vN/2 and the position of particles in the second group by w1, . . . , wN/2. Then we can form the wavefunction ˜ψCGT (z) = S [ ∏ i<j (vi − vj)2(wi − wj)2] – 129 – where S means that we symmetrise over all ways of diving the electrons into two groups, ensuring that we end up with a bosonic wavefunction. The claim is that ψM R(z) = ˜ψCGT (z) ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m−1 We won’t prove this claim here 33. But let’s just do a few sanity checks. At m = 1, the Moore-Read wavefunction is a polynomial in z of degree N(N/2 − 1), while any given coordinate – say z1 – has at most power N − 2. Both of these properties are easily seen to hold for ˜ψCGT . Finally, and most importantly, ˜ψCGT (z) vanishes only if three particles all come together since two of these particles must sit in the same group. It’s now simple to generalise this construction. Consider N = pd particles. We’ll separate these into p groups of d particles whose positions we label as w(a) 1 , . . . , w(a) d where a = 1, . . . , p labels the group. We then form the Read-Rezayi wavefunction 34 ˜ψRR(z) = S [ ∏ i<j (w(1) i − w(1) j )2 . . . ∏ i<j (w(p) i − w(p) j )2] ∏ k<l(zk − zl)m−1 where, again, we symmetrise over all possible clustering of particles into the p groups. This now has the property that the m = 1 wavefunction vanishes only if the positions of p + 1 particles coincide. For this reason, these are sometimes referred to as p-clustered states, while the original Moore-Read wavefunction is called a paired state. Like the Moore-Read state, the Read-Rezayi state describes fermions for m even and bosons for m odd. The ﬁlling fraction can be computed in the usual manner by looking at the highest power of some given position. We ﬁnd ν = p Quasi-Holes One can write down quasi-hole excitations above the Read-Rezayi state. Perhaps un- surprisingly, such quasi-holes necessarily come in groups of p. The simplest such state is ˜ψ(z) = S   p∏ a=1 N/p∏ i=1(w(a) i − ηa) p∏ a=1 ∏ i<j (w(a) i − w(a) j )2   ∏ k<l(zk − zl)m−1 As with the Moore-Read state, when the positions of all p quasi-holes coincide, we get a Laughlin quasi-hole factor ∏ (zi − η). This combined object should have charge νe, so the individual quasi-holes of the Read-Rezayi state have charge e ⋆ = ν We’ll see that there is an intricate structure imposed on any model arising from the consistency of exchanging diﬀerent groups of anyons. As we go along, we’ll try to make contact with the non-Abelian anyons that we’ve seen arising in quantum Hall systems. The starting point of this abstract theory is simply a list of the diﬀerent types of anyons that we have in our model. We’ll call them a, b, c, etc. We include in this list a special state which has no particles. This is called the vacuum and is denoted as 1. 4.3.1 Fusion The ﬁrst important property we need is the idea of fusion. When we bring two anyons together, the object that we’re left with must, when viewed from afar, also be one of the anyons on our list. The subtlety is that we need not be left with a unique type of anyon when we do this. We denote the possible types of anyon that can arise as a and b are brought together — of fused — as a ⋆ b = ∑ c N c ab c (4.20) where N c ab is an integer that tells us how many diﬀerent ways there are to get the anyon of type c. It doesn’t matter which order we fuse anyons, so a ⋆ b = b ⋆ a or, equivalently, N c ab = N c ba. We can also interpret the equation the other way round: if a speciﬁc anyon c appears on the right of this equation, then there is a way for it to split into anyons of type a and b. The vacuum 1 is the trivial state in the sense that a ⋆ 1 = a for all a. The idea that we can get diﬀerent states when we bring two particles together is a familiar concept from the theory of angular momentum. For example, when we put two spin-1/2 particles together we can either get a particle of spin 1 or a particle of spin 0. However, there’s an important diﬀerence between this example and the non-Abelian anyons. Each spin 1/2 particle had a Hilbert space of dimension 2. When we tensor two of these together, we get a Hilbert space of dimension 4 which we decompose as 2 × 2 = 3 + 1 Such a simple interpretation is not available for non-Abelian anyons. Typically, we don’t think of a single anyon as having any internal degrees of freedom and, correspondingly, – 132 – it has no associated Hilbert space beyond its position degree of freedom. Yet a pair of anyons do carry extra information. Indeed, (4.20) tells us that the Hilbert space Hab describing the “internal” state of a pair of anyons has dimension dim(Hab) = ∑ c N c ab The anyons are called non-Abelian whenever N c ab ≥ 2 for some a, b and c. The infor- mation contained in this Hilbert space is not carried by any local degree of freedom. Indeed, when the two anyons a and b are well separated, the wavefunctions describing diﬀerent states in Hab will typically look more or less identical in any local region. The information is carried by more global properties of the wavefunction. For this reason, the Hilbert space Hab is sometimes called the topological Hilbert space. All of this is very reminiscent of the situation that we met when discussing the quasi- holes for the Moore-Read state, although there we only found an internal Hilbert space when we introduced 4 or more quasi-holes. We’ll see the relationship shortly. Suppose now that we bring three or more anyons together. We will insist that the Hilbert space of ﬁnal states is independent of the order in which we bring them together. Mathematically, this means that fusion is associative, (a ⋆ b) ⋆ c = a ⋆ (b ⋆ c) With this information, we can extrapolate to bringing any number of n anyons, a1, a2, . . . , an together. The resulting states can be ﬁgured out by iterating the rules above: each c that can be formed from a1 × a2 can now fuse with a3 and each of their products can fuse with a4 and so on. The dimension of the resulting Hilbert space Ha1...an is dim(Ha1...an) = ∑ b1,...,bn−2 N b1 a1a2N b2 b1a3 . . . N bn−1 bn−2an (4.21) In particular, we can bring n anyons of the same type a together. The asymptotic dimension of the resulting Hilbert space H(n) a is written as dim(H(n) a ) → (da)n as n → ∞ Here da is called the quantum dimension of the anyon. They obey da ≥ 1. The vacuum anyon 1 always has d1 = 1. Very roughy speaking, the quantum dimension should be thought of as the number of degrees of freedom carried by in a single anyon. However, as we’ll see, these numbers are typically non-integer reﬂecting the fact that, as we’ve stressed above, you can’t really think of the information as being stored on an individual anyon. – 133 – There’s a nice relationship obeyed by the quantum dimensions. From (4.21), and using the fact that N c ab = N c ba, we can write the dimension of H(n) a as dim(H(n) a ) = ∑ b1,...,bn−2 N b1 aaN b2 ab1 . . . N bn−1 abn−2 = ∑ b [Na]n ab where Na is the matrix with components N c ab and in the expression above it is raised to the n th power. But, in the n → ∞, such a product is dominated by the largest eigenvalue of the matrix Na. This eigenvalue is the quantum dimension da. There is therefore an eigenvector e = (e1, . . . , en) satisfying Nae = dae ⇒ N c abec = daeb For what it’s worth, the Perron-Frobenius theorem in mathematics deals with eigen- value equations of this type. Among other things, it states that all the components of ea are strictly positive. In fact, in the present case the symmetry of N c ab = N c ba tells us what they must be. For the right-hand-side to be symmetric we must have ea = da. This means that the quantum dimensions obey dadb = ∑ c N c abdc Before we proceed any further with the formalism, it’s worth looking at two examples of non-Abelian anyons. An Example: Fibonacci Anyons Fibonacci anyons are perhaps the simplest36. They have, in addition to the vacuum 1, just a single type of anyon which we denote as τ . The fusion rules consist of the obvious τ ⋆ 1 = 1 ⋆ τ = τ together with τ ⋆ τ = 1 ⊕ τ (4.22) So we have dim(H(2) τ ) = 2. Now if we add a third anyon, it can fuse with the single τ to give τ ⋆ τ ⋆ τ = 1 ⊕ τ ⊕ τ with dim(H(3) τ ) = 3. For four anyons we have dim(H(4) τ ) = 5. In general, one can show that dim(H(n+1) τ ) = dim(H(n) τ ) + dim(H(n−1) τ ). This is the Fibonacci sequence and is what gives the anyons their name. The matrix Nτ , with components N c τ b can be read oﬀ from the fusion rules Nτ = ( 0 1 1 1 ) The quantum dimension is the positive eigenvalue of this matrix which turns out to be the golden ratio. dτ = 1 Suppose that we have three anyons, a, b and c. We ﬁrst fuse a and b together and, of all the possibilities allowed by the fusion rules, we get some speciﬁc anyon i. We subsequently fuse i with c and end up with a speciﬁc anyon d. All of this is captured by a fusion tree which looks like this: a b c d i (4.26) We list the anyons that we start with at the top and then read the tree by working downwards to see which anyons fuse to which. Alternatively, you could read the tree by starting at the bottom and thinking of anyons as splittng. Importantly, there can be several diﬀerent anyons i that appear in the intermediate channel. Now suppose that we do the fusing in a diﬀerent order: we ﬁrst fuse b with c and subsequently fuse the product with a. We ask that the end product will again be the anyon d. But what will the intermediate state be? There could be several diﬀerent possibilities j. a b c d j The question we want to ask is: if we deﬁnitely got state i in the ﬁrst route, which of the states j appear in the second route. In general, there won’t be a speciﬁc state j, but rather a linear combination of them. This is described graphically by the equation a b c d i = ∑ j (F d abc)ij a b c d j (4.27) where the coeﬃcients (F d abc)ij are thought of as the coeﬃcients of a unitary matrix, F d abc, speciﬁed by the four anyons a, b, c and d. This is called the fusion matrix. A comment: in our attempt to keep the notation concise, we’ve actually missed an important aspect here. If there are more than one ways in which the anyons j can appear in intermediate states then we should sum over all of them and, correspondingly, the fusion matrix should have more indices. More crucially, sometimes there will be – 136 – multiple ways in which the ﬁnal state d can appear. This will happen whenever N d aj ≥ 2 for some j. In this case, the the process on the left will typically give a linear combination of the diﬀerent d states on the right. The fusion matrix should also include indices which sum over these possibilities. The fusion matrices are extra data needed to specify the structure of non-Abelian anyons. However, they can’t be chosen arbitrarily: there are consistency relations which they must satisfy. For some simple theories, this is suﬃcient to determine the fusion matrix completely given the fusion rules. The consistency condition comes from considering four anyons fusing to an end prod- uct. To avoid burgeoning alphabetical notation, we’ll call the initial anyons 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the ﬁnal anyon 5. (The notation is not ideal because the anyon 1 does not mean the vacuum here!) We start with some fusion process in which the anyons are fused in order, with ﬁxed intermediate states i and j, like this i j 1 2 3 5 4 Now we consider reversing the order of fusion. We can do this in two diﬀerent paths which is simplest to depict in a graphical notation, known as the pentagon diagram, j 1 3 5 4 m 2 1 3 5 42 m l Fim4 5 1 2 5 4 i k 3Fi34 5 F12k 5 i j 1 2 3 5 4 F123 j 1 5 42 3 l k F234 l The fact that the upper and lower paths in the diagram give the same result means that the fusion matrix must obey (F 5 12k)il(F 5 i34)jk = ∑ m (F l 234)mk(F 5 1m4)jl(F j 123)im (4.28) – 137 – These are simply sets of polynomial relations for the coeﬃcients of the fusion matrix. One might think that fusing more anyons together gives further consistency rules. It turns out that these all reduce to the pentagon condition above. Let’s look at what this means for our two favourite examples. The Fusion Matrix for Fibonacci Anyons For Fibonacci anyons, the interesting constraint comes from when all external particles are τ . The pentagon equation (4.28) then reads (F τ τ τ k)il(F τ iτ τ )jk = ∑ m (F l τ τ τ )mk(F τ τ mτ )jl(F j τ τ τ )im Things simplify further by noting that all fusion matrices F d abc are simply given by the identity whenever a, b, c or d are equal to the vacuum state. (This is always true when a, b or c is equal to the vacuum state and, for Fibonacci anyons, holds also when d is the vacuum state). The only non-trivial matrix is F τ τ τ τ . If we set j, k = τ and i, l = 1 in the above equation, we get (F τ τ τ τ )11 = (F τ τ τ τ )τ 1(F τ τ τ τ )1τ Combined with the fact that F τ τ τ τ is unitary, this constraint is suﬃcient to determine the fusion matrix completely. It is F τ τ τ τ = ( d−1 τ d−1/2 τ d−1/2 τ −d−1 τ ) (4.29) where we previously calculated (4.23) that the quantum dimension dτ = (1 + √ We’d now like to make contact with what we learned in Section 4.2. How do we think about this fusing matrix in the context of, say, Majorana zero modes? In fact, there seems to be mismatch from the oﬀ, because the fusion matrix starts with three anyons fusing to one, while the Majorana zero modes naturally came in pairs, meaning that we should start with an even number of vortices. We can, however, interpret the original fusion diagram (4.26) in a slightly diﬀerent way. We fuse a and b to get anyon i, but (tilting out heads), the diagram also says that fusing c and d should give the same type of anyon i. What does this mean in terms of our basis of states (4.15)? The obvious interpretation is that state |0⟩ is where both have fused to 1; the state Ψ† 1|0⟩ is where the ﬁrst and second anyon have fused to give ψ while the third and fourth have fused to give 1; the state Ψ† 1|0⟩ is the opposite; and the state Ψ† 1Ψ† 2|0⟩ is where both have fused to give ψ anyons. All of this means that the diagram (4.26) with i = 1 is capturing the state |0⟩ of four anyons, while the diagram with i = ψ is capturing the state Ψ† 1Ψ† 2|0⟩. Now let’s think about the right-hand side of equation (4.27). This time anyons a and d fuse together to give a speciﬁc anyon j, while b and c fuse together to give the same anyon j. In terms of Majorana zero modes, we should now rebuild our Hilbert space, not using the original pairing (4.14), but instead using ˜Ψ1 = 1 resulting states are related by the R-matrix, deﬁned by b a c = Rc ab c ab If N c ab = 1, so that there only a single option for the ﬁnal anyon, then Rc ab is simply a complex phase. However, if N c ab ≥ 2, so that there are several diﬀerent ways of getting the ﬁnal anyon c, then there’s no reason we should get the same state after the exchange. In this case, the R-matrix is a genuine matrix of size N c ab × N c ab and we should be summing over all possible ﬁnal states on the right-hand side. There are further consistency relations that come from reversing the operations of fusion and braiding. Again, these are best described graphically although the resulting pictures tend to have lots of swirling lines unless we ﬁrst introduce some new notation. We’ll write the left-hand side of the R-matrix equation above as b a c ≡ c a b = Rc ab c ab Now the consistency relation between fusion matrices and R-matrices arise from the following hexagon diagram k 1 32 i 4 R 1 2 3 4 j 3 12 j 4 R k 2 1 3 4 F F F R i 1 2 3 4 2 3 1 4 In equations, this reads – 140 – Rk 13(F 4 213)kiRi 12 = ∑ j (F 4 231)kjR4 j1(F 4 123)ji (4.31) It turns out that the pentagon (4.28) and hexagon (4.31) equations are the only con- straints that we need to impose on the system. If, for a given set of fusion rules (4.20), we can ﬁnd solutions to these sets of polynomial equations then we have a consistent theory of non-Abelian anyons. The R-Matrix for Fibonacci Anyons Let’s see how this works for Fibonacci anyons. We want to compute two phases: R1 τ τ and Rτ τ τ . (When either of the lower indices on R is the vacuum state, it is equal to 1.) We computed the fusion matrix F = F τ τ τ τ in (4.29). The left-hand side of the equation is then Rk τ τ FkiRi τ τ = Fk1F1i + Fkτ Fτ iRτ τ τ Note also our choice of notation has become annoying: in the equation above 1 means the vacuum, while in (4.31) it refers to whatever external state we chose to put there. (Sorry!) The equation above must hold for each k and i; we don’t sum over these indices. This means that it is three equations for two unknowns and there’s no guarantee that there’s a solution. This is the non-trivial part of the consistency relations. For Fibonacci anyons, it is simple to check that there is a solution. The phases arising from braiding are: R1 τ τ = e 4πi/5 and Rτ τ τ = −e 2πi/5 The R-Matrix for Ising Anyons For Ising anyons, the consistency relations give R1 σσ = e −iπ/8 and Rσ σσ = e −3πi/8 Note ﬁrstly that these are just Abelian phases; the non-Abelian part of exchange that was described by (4.18) for Majorana zero modes is really captured by the fusion matrix in this more formal notation. Note also that this doesn’t agree with the result for anyons computed in Section 4.2.2 since these results depended on the additional Abelian statistical parameter α. (In fact, the results do agree if we take α = ±1/8 or, equivalently ﬁlling factor ν = 1/2.) For general ﬁlling factor, the non-Abelian anyons in the Moore-Read state should be thought of as attached to further Abelian anyons which shifts this phase. – 141 – 4.3.4 There is a Subject Called Topological Quantum Computing There has been a huge surge of interest in non-Abelian anyons over the past 15 years, much of it driven by the possibility of using these objects to build a quantum computer. The idea is that the Hilbert space of non-Abelian anyons should be thought of as the collection of qubits, while the braiding and fusion operations that we’ve described above are the unitary operations that act as quantum gates. The advantage of using non- Abelian anyons is that, as we’ve seen, the information is not stored locally. This means that it is immune to decoherence and other errors which mess up calculations since this noise, like all other physics, arises from local interactions 38. This subject goes by the name of topological quantum computing. I’ll make no attempt to explain this vast subject here. A wonderfully clear introduction can be found in the lecture notes by John Preskill. 5. Chern-Simons Theories So far we’ve approached the quantum Hall states from a microscopic perspective, look- ing at the wavefunctions which describe individual electrons. In this section, we take a step back and describe the quantum Hall eﬀect on a more coarse-grained level. Our goal is to construct eﬀective ﬁeld theories which capture the response of the quantum Hall ground state to low-energy perturbations. These eﬀective theories are known as Chern-Simons theories39. They have many interesting properties and, in addition to their role in the quantum Hall eﬀect, play a starring role in several other stories. Throughout this section, we’ll make very general statements about the kind of low- energy eﬀective behaviour that is possible, with very little input about the microscopic properties of the model. As we will see, we will be able to reconstruct many of the phenomena that we’ve met in the previous chapters. We will treat the gauge potential Aµ of electromagnetism as a background gauge ﬁeld. This means that Aµ is not dynamical; it is only a parameter of the theory which tells us which electric and magnetic ﬁelds we’ve turned on. Further, we will not include in Aµ the original background magnetic ﬁeld which gave rise the Hall eﬀect to begin with. Instead, Aµ will describe only perturbations around a given Hall state, either by turning on an electric ﬁeld, or by perturbing the applied magnetic ﬁeld but keeping the kind of state (i.e. the ﬁlling fraction) ﬁxed. In the ﬁeld theory context, Aµ always couples to the dynamical degrees of freedom through the appropriate current Jµ, so that the action includes the term SA = ∫ d3x J µAµ (5.1) This is the ﬁeld theoretic version of (2.8). Note that the measure ∫ d3x means that we’ve assumed that the current lives in a d = 2 + 1 dimensional slice of spacetime; it couples to the gauge ﬁeld Aµ evaluated on that slice. The action SA is invariant under gauge transformations Aµ → Aµ + ∂µω on account of the conservation of the current ∂µJ µ = 0 These two simple equations will be our starting point for writing down eﬀective ﬁeld theories that tell us how the system responds when we perturb it by turning on a background electric or magnetic ﬁeld. 5.1 The Integer Quantum Hall Eﬀect We start by looking at the integer quantum Hall eﬀect. We will say nothing about electrons or Landau levels or anything microscopic. Instead, in our attempt to talk with some generality, we will make just one, seemingly mild, assumption: at low- energies, there are no degrees of freedom that can aﬀect the physics when the system is perturbed. Let’s think about what this assumption means. The ﬁrst, and most obvious, require- ment is that there is a gap to the ﬁrst excited state. In other words, our system is an insulator rather than a conductor. We’re then interested in the physics at energies below this gap. Naively, you might think that this is enough to ensure that there are no relevant low-energy degrees of freedom. However, there’s also a more subtle requirement hiding in our assumption. This is related to the existence of so-called “topological degrees of freedom”. We will ignore this subtlety for now, but return to it in Section 5.2 when we discuss the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect. As usual in quantum ﬁeld theory, we want to compute the partition function. This is not a function of the dynamical degrees of freedom since these are what we inte- grate over. Instead, it’s a function of the sources which, for us, is the electromagnetic potential Aµ. We write the partition function schematically as Z[Aµ] = ∫ D(ﬁelds) e iS[ﬁelds;A]/ℏ (5.2) where “ﬁelds” refer to all dynamical degrees of freedom. The action S could be anything at all, as long as it satisﬁes our assumption above and includes the coupling to Aµ through the current (5.1). We now want to integrate out all these degrees of freedom, to leave ourselves with a theory of the ground state which we write as Z[Aµ] = e iSeﬀ [Aµ]/ℏ (5.3) Our goal is to compute Seﬀ[Aµ], which is usually referred to as the eﬀective action. Note, however, that it’s not the kind of action you meet in classical mechanics. It depends on the parameters of the problem rather than dynamical ﬁelds. We don’t use it to compute Euler-Lagrange equations since there’s no dynamics in Aµ. Nonetheless, it does contain important information since, from the coupling (5.1), we have δSeﬀ[A] Since we don’t know what the microscopic Lagrangian is, we can’t explicitly do the path integral in (5.2). Instead, our strategy is just to write down all possible terms that can arise and then focus on the most important ones. Thankfully, there are many restrictions on what the answer can be which means that there are just a handful of terms we need to consider. The ﬁrst restrictions is that the eﬀective action Seﬀ[A] must be gauge invariant. One simple way to achieve this is to construct it out of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E = −1 ǫ and µ which are the free parameters characterising the response of the system. (Note that the response captured by (5.5) isn’t quite the same as Ohm’s law that we met in Section 1 as there’s no dissipation in our current framework). The action (5.5) has no Hall conductivity because this is ruled out in d = 3 + 1 dimensions on rotational grounds. But, as we have seen in great detail, a Hall conductivity is certainly possible in d = 2 + 1 dimensions. This means that there must be another kind of term that we can write in the eﬀective action. And indeed there is.... 5.1.1 The Chern-Simons Term The thing that’s special in d = 2+1 dimension is the existence of the epsilon symbol ǫµνρ with µ, ν, ρ = 0, 1, 2. We can then write down a new term, consistent with rotational invariance. The resulting eﬀective action is Seﬀ[A] = SCS[A] where SCS[A] = k and, correspondingly, A0 → A0, A1 → −A1 and A2 → A2. The measure ∫ d3x is invariant under parity (recall that although x1 → −x1, the limits of the integral also change). However, the integrand is not invariant: ǫ µνρAµ∂νAρ → −ǫ µνρAµ∂νAρ. This means that the Chern-Simons eﬀective action with k ̸= 0 can only arise in systems that break parity. Looking back at the kinds of systems we met in Section 2 which exhibit a Hall conductivity, we see that they all break parity, typically because of a background magnetic ﬁeld. Let’s look at the physics captured by the Chern-Simons term using (5.4). First, we can compute the current that arises from Chern-Simons term. It is Ji = δSCS[A] non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories that we introduce in Section 5.4). To see how it arises, it’s perhaps simplest to place the theory at ﬁnite temperature and compute the corresponding partition function, again with Aµ a source. To explain this, we ﬁrst need a small aside about how should think about the equilibrium properties of ﬁeld theories at ﬁnite temperature. 5.1.2 An Aside: Periodic Time Makes Things Hot In this small aside we will look at the connection between the thermal partition function that we work with in statistical mechanics and the quantum partition function that we work with in quantum ﬁeld theory. To explain this, we’re going to go right back to basics. This means the dynamics of a single particle. Consider a quantum particle of mass m moving in one direction with coordinate q. Suppose it moves in a potential V (q). The statistical mechanics partition function is Z[β] = Tr e −βH (5.9) where H is, of course, the Hamiltonian operator and β = 1/T is the inverse temperature (using conventions with kB = 1). We would like to write down a path integral expression for this thermal partition function. We’re more used to thinking of path integrals for time evolution in quantum me- chanics. Suppose the particle sits at some point qi at time t = 0. The Feynman path integral provides an expression for the amplitude for the particle to evolve to position q = qf at a time t later, ⟨qf |e −iHt|qi⟩ = ∫ q(t)=qf q(0)=qi Dq e iS (5.10) where S is the classical action, given by S = ∫ t 0 dt ′ [m With this substitution, the action becomes iS = ∫ −iτ 0 dτ ′ [ −m the theory now formulated on the Euclidean space Rd−1 × S 1, where the circle is parameterised by τ ∈ [0, β). There is one extra caveat that you need to know. While all bosonic ﬁeld are periodic in the time direction (just like q(τ ) in our example above), fermionic ﬁelds should be made anti-periodic: they pick up a minus sign as you go around the circle. All of this applies directly to the thermal partition function for our quantum Hall theory, resulting in an eﬀective action Seﬀ[A] which itself lives on R2 × S 1. However, there’s one small diﬀerence for Chern-Simons terms. The presence of the ǫµνρ symbol in (5.6) means that the action in Euclidean space picks up an extra factor of i. The upshot is that, in both Lorentzian and Euclidean signature, the term in the path integral takes the form e iSCS /ℏ. This will be important in what follows. 5.1.3 Quantisation of the Chern-Simons level We’re now in a position to understand the quantisation of the Chern-Simons level k in (5.6). As advertised earlier, we look at the partition function at ﬁnite temperature by taking time to be Euclidean S 1, parameterised by τ with periodicity (5.11). Having a periodic S 1 factor in the geometry allows us to do something novel with gauge transformations, Aµ → Aµ + ∂µω. Usually, we work with functions ω(t, x) which are single valued. But that’s actually too restrictive: we should ask only that the physical ﬁelds are single valued. The electron wavefunction (in the language of quantum mechanics) or ﬁeld (in the language of, well, ﬁelds) transforms as e ieω/ℏ. So the real requirement is not that ω is single valued, but rather that e ieω/ℏ is single valued. And, when the background geometry has a S 1 factor, that allows us to do something novel where the gauge transformations “winds” around the circle, with ω = 2πℏτ radius β of the S 1. Our interest is in how the Chern-Simons term fares under gauge transformations of the type (5.12). To get something interesting, we’ll also need to add one extra ingredient. We think about the spatial directions as forming a sphere S 2, rather than a plane R2. (This is reminiscent of the kind of set-ups we used in Section 2, where all the general arguments we gave for quantisation involved some change of the background geometry, whether an annulus or torus or lattice). We take advantage of this new geometry by threading a background magnetic ﬂux through the spatial S 2, given by 1 the gauge ﬁeld as being deﬁned locally on diﬀerent patches and glued together in an appropriate fashion. (Alternatively, there’s a way to think of the Chern-Simons action as living on the boundary of a four dimensional space.) We won’t do this proper job here. But the answer (5.15) is the correct one. Now that we’ve evaluated the Chern-Simons action on this particular conﬁguration, let’s see how it fares under gauge transformations (5.13) which shift A0. We learn that the Chern-Simons term is not quite gauge invariant after all. Instead, it transforms as SCS → SCS + 2πℏ2k gauge transformations (5.12) are allowed. Because the charge appears in the exponent, an implicit assumption here is that all ﬁelds transform with the same charge. We can, in fact, soften this slightly and one can repeat the argument whenever charges are rational multiples of each other. Abelian gauge symmetries with this property are sometimes referred to as compact. It is an experimental fact, which we’ve all known since high school, that the gauge symmetry of Electromagnetism is compact (because the charge of the electron is minus the charge of the proton). Second, the derivation required there to be a minimum ﬂux quantum (5.14), set by the Dirac quantisation condition. Yet a close inspection of the Dirac condition shows that this too hinges on the compactness of the gauge group. In other words, the compact nature of Electromagnetism is all that’s needed to ensure the quantisation of the Hall conductivity. In contrast, Abelian gauge symmetries which are non-compact — for example, be- cause they have charges which are irrational multiples of each other — cannot have magnetic monopoles, or ﬂuxes of the form (5.14). We sometimes denote their gauge group as R instead of U(1) to highlight this non-compactness. For such putative non- compact gauge ﬁelds, there is no topological restriction on the Hall conductivity. 5.2 The Fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect In the last section, we saw very compelling arguments for why the Hall conductivity must be quantised. Yet now that leaves us in a bit of a bind, because we somehow have to explain the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect where this quantisation is not obeyed. Suddenly, the great power and generality of our previous arguments seems quite daunt- ing! If we want to avoid the conclusion that the Hall conductivity takes integer values, our only hope is to violate one of the assumptions that went into our previous arguments. Yet the only thing we assumed is that there are no dynamical degrees which can aﬀect the low-energy energy physics when the system is perturbed. And, at ﬁrst glance, this looks rather innocuous: we might naively expect that this is true for any system which has a gap in its spectrum, as long as the energy of the perturbation is smaller than that gap. Moreover, the fractional quantum Hall liquids certainly have a gap. So what are we missing? What we’re missing is a subtle and beautiful piece of physics that has many far reach- ing consequences. It turns out that there can be degrees of freedom which are gapped, but nonetheless aﬀect the physics at arbitrarily low-energy scales. These degrees of – 153 – freedom are sometimes called “topological”. Our goal in this section is to describe the topological degrees of freedom relevant for the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect. Let’s think about what this means. We want to compute the partition function Z[Aµ] = ∫ D(ﬁelds) e iS[ﬁelds;A]/ℏ where Aµ again couples to the ﬁelds through the current (5.1). However, this time, we should not integrate out all the ﬁelds if we want to be left with a local eﬀective action. Instead, we should retain the topological degrees of freedom. The tricky part is that these topological degrees of freedom can be complicated combinations of the original ﬁelds and it’s usually very diﬃcult to identify in advance what kind of emergent ﬁelds will arise in a given system. So, rather than work from ﬁrst principles, we will ﬁrst think about what kinds of topological degrees of freedom may arise. Then we’ll ﬁgure out the consequences. In the rest of this section, we describe the low-energy eﬀective theory relevant to Laughlin states with ν = 1/m. In subsequent sections, we’ll generalise this to other ﬁlling fractions. 5.2.1 A First Look at Chern-Simons Dynamics In d = 2 + 1 dimensions, the simplest kind of topological ﬁeld theory involves a U(1) dynamical gauge ﬁeld aµ. We stress that this is not the gauge ﬁeld of electromagnetism, which we’ll continue to denote as Aµ. Instead aµ is an emergent gauge ﬁeld, arising from the collective behaviour of many underlying electrons. You should think of this as something analogous to the way phonons arise as the collective motion of many underlying atoms. We will see the direct relationship between aµ and the electron degrees of freedom later. We’re used to thinking of gauge ﬁelds as describing massless degrees of freedom (at least classically). Indeed, their dynamics is usually described by the Maxwell action, SMaxwell[a] = − 1 However, as we’ve already seen, there is a new kind of action that we can write down for gauge ﬁelds in d = 2 + 1 dimensions. This is the Chern-Simons action SCS[a] = k Maxwell action (5.16). If we are to couple this to a background metric gµν, the action becomes SMaxwell = − 1 Our goal now is to write down Seﬀ[a; A]. However, to get something interesting we’re going to need a coupling between Aµ and aµ. Yet we know that Aµ has to couple to the electron current J µ. So if this is going to work at all, we’re going to have to ﬁnd a relationship between aµ and J µ. Thankfully, conserved currents are hard to come by and there’s essentially only one thing that we can write down. The current is given by J µ = e 2 going to be easy to do. We would naively just replace such a ﬁeld with its equation of motion which, in this case, is fµν = 1 First, we’ll set the background gauge ﬁeld Aµ to zero. (It is, after all, a background parameter at our disposal in this framework). The equation of motion for aµ is then e 2 The attachment of the ﬂux to the quasi-hole is reminiscent of the composite fermion ideas that we met in Section 3.3.2, in which we attached vortices (which were zeros of the wavefunction) to quasi-holes. Fractional Statistics Done Better The above calculation is nice and quick and gives the right result. But there’s a famously annoying factor of 2 that we’ve swept under the rug. Here’s the issue. As the charge q in the ﬁrst particle moved around the ﬂux Φ in the second, we picked up a phase e iqΦ/ℏ. But you might think that the ﬂux Φ of the ﬁrst particle also moved around the charge q of the second. So surely this should give another factor of e iqΦ/ℏ. Right? Well, no. To see why, it’s best to just do the calculation. For generality, let’s take N particles sitting at positions xa(t) which, as the notation shows, we allow to change with time. The charge density and currents are j0(x, t) = e N∑ a=1 δ2(x − xa(t)) and j(x, t) = e N∑ a=1 ˙xa δ2(x − xa(t)) The equation of motion (5.24) can be easily solved even in this general case. If we work in the Coulomb gauge a0 = 0 with ∂iai = 0 (summing over spatial indices only), the solution is given by ai(x, t) = ℏ It’s worth pointing out that this Chern-Simons computation ended up looking exactly the same as the original Berry phase calculation for the Laughlin wavefunctions that we saw in Section 3.2.3. For example, the connection (5.26) is identical to the relevant part of the Berry connections (3.25) and (3.26). (The seeming diﬀerence in the factor of 2 can be traced to our previous normalisation for complex connections). Breathing Life into the Quasi-Holes In the calculations above, we’ve taken jµ to be some ﬁxed, background current describ- ing the quasi-particles. But the framework of eﬀective ﬁeld theory also allows us to make the quasi-particles dynamical. We simply need to introduce a new bosonic ﬁeld φ and include it in the eﬀective action, coupled minimally to aµ. We then endow φ with its own dynamics. Exactly what dynamics we choose is up to us at this point. For example, if we wanted the quasi-holes to have a relativistic dispersion relation, we would introduce the action Seﬀ[a, φ] = ∫ d3x e 2m 1 γ 2 γ Figure 40: Figure 41: To see this eﬀect, we can turn oﬀ the background sources and focus only on the dynamical part of the eﬀective theory, SCS = e 2 Because the Chern-Simons theory is ﬁrst order in time derivatives, these Wilson loops are really parameterising the phase space of solutions, rather than the conﬁguration space. Moreover, because the Wilson lines are complex numbers of unit modulus, the phase space is compact. On general grounds, we would expect that when we quantise a compact phase space, we get a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space. Our next task is to understand how to do this. The canonical commutation relations can be read oﬀ from the Chern-Simons action (5.27) [a1(x), a2(x ′)] = 2πi Now we’d like to repeat this to implement the hierarchy construction described in Section 3.3.1 in which the quasi-particles themselves form a new quantum Hall state. But that’s very straightforward. We simply write the quasi-particle current jµ as jµ = 1 the new, third, emergent gauge ﬁeld with a Chern-Simons term. And so on and so on. The resulting states have ﬁlling fraction ν = 1 We’ve already met the K-matrix associated to the hierarchy of states. It is K =        m −1 0 . . . −1 ˜m1 −1 0 −1 ˜m2 . . . .        and t = (1, 0, 0 . . .) But we can also use the K-matrix approach to describe other Hall states. For example, the (m1, m2, n) Halperin states that we met in Section 3.3.4 have K-matrices given by K = ( m1 n n m2 ) and t = (1, 1) Using our formula above, we ﬁnd that the ﬁlling fraction is ν = (K −1)ijtitj = m1 + m2 − 2n The pair (K, t), subject to the equivalence (5.32), are almost enough to classify the possible Abelian quantum states. It turns out, however, that there’s one thing missing. This is known as the shift. It is related to the degeneracy when the Hall ﬂuid is placed on manifolds of diﬀerent topology; you can read about this in the reviews by Wen or Zee. More recently, it’s been realised that the shift is also related to the so-called Hall viscosity of the ﬂuid. 5.3 Particle-Vortex Duality The eﬀective ﬁeld theories that we’ve described above were not the ﬁrst attempt to use Chern-Simons theory as a description of the quantum Hall eﬀect. Instead, the original attempts tried to write down local order parameters for the quantum Hall states and build a low-energy eﬀective theory modelled on the usual Ginzburg-Landau approach that we met in the Statistical Physics lectures. It’s now appreciated that the more subtle topological aspects of the quantum Hall states that we’ve described above are not captured by a Ginzburg-Landau theory. Nonetheless, this approach provides a framework in which many detailed properties of the quantum Hall states can be computed. We won’t provide all these details here and this section will be less comprehensive than others. Its main purpose is to explain how to construct these alternative theories and provide some pointers to the literature. Moreover, we also take this opportunity to advertise a beautiful property of quantum ﬁeld theories in d = 2 + 1 dimensions known as particle-vortex duality. 5.3.1 The XY -Model and the Abelian-Higgs Model In d = 2 + 1 dimensional ﬁeld theories, there are two kinds of particle excitations that can appear. The ﬁrst kind is the familiar excitation that we get when we quantise a local ﬁeld. This is that kind that we learned about in our Quantum Field Theory course. The second kind of particle is a vortex, deﬁned by the winding of some local order parameter. These arise as solitons of the theory. Often in d = 2 + 1 dimensions, it’s possible to write down two very diﬀerent-looking theories which describe the same physics. This is possible because the particles of one theory are related to the vortices of the other, and vice versa. We start by explaining how this works in the simplest example, ﬁrst proposed in the 70’s by Peskin and early ’80’s by Dasgupta and Halperin. – 167 – Theory A: The XY -ModelTheory B: The Abelian-Higgs ModelHere σ is playing the role of a Lagrange multiplier whose role is to impose the Bianchi identity ǫ µνρ∂µ ˜fνρ = 0. If the ﬁeld strength obeys the Dirac quantisation condition, then σ has periodicity 2π. Now we integrate out the ﬁeld strength, leaving ourselves only with an eﬀective action for σ, Z = exp ( i ∫ d3x g2 The breaking of the U(1) gauge symmetry means that there are vortex solutions in the Higgs phase. These are deﬁned by the asymptotic winding of the expec- tation value of ˜φ. The resulting solutions exhibit some nice properties 41. First, unlike the global vortices of Theory A, vortices associated to a gauge symmetry have ﬁnite mass. Second, they also carry quantised magnetic ﬂux ∮ dx i∂i ˜φ = 1 But this is precisely our earlier eﬀective action for the Laughlin state at ﬁlling fraction ν = 1/m. In this context, the excitations of the ﬁeld φ describe quasi-holes and quasi- particles in the theory, with fractional charge and statistics. The background gauge ﬁeld of electromagnetism Aµ couples to the electron current which is jµ = 1 In contrast, in the Ginzburg-Landau approach to this problem it is more common to write down a ﬁeld theory for electrons above the vacuum state. This is slightly odd because the resulting physics clearly requires a large number of electrons to be present but we can always insist upon this by including an appropriate chemical potential. We’ll call the bosonic ﬁeld that gives rise to electrons Φ. This ﬁeld now has ﬁrst order kinetic terms, reﬂecting the fact that there are no longer anti-particles. (Well, there are but they require around 1010 more energy than is available in quantum Hall system; this is condensed matter physics, not particle physics!). The resulting Lagrangian is S = ∫ d3x iΦ †(∂0 − iα0 − iµ)Φ − 1 Let’s brieﬂy restrict to the case of m odd, so that the “electrons” are actual electrons. They can be thought of as bosons Φ attached to −m ﬂux units. Alternatively, the bosons Φ can be thought of as electrons attached to +m units of ﬂux. This object is referred to as a composite boson. Notice that it’s very similar in spirit to the composite fermion that we met earlier. The diﬀerence is that we attach an odd number of ﬂuxes to the electron to make a composite boson, while an even number of ﬂuxes gives a composite fermion. In the next section, we’ll see how to make a composite fermion in this language. Oﬀ-Diagonal Long-Range Order We took a rather round-about route to get to Lagrangian (5.38): we ﬁrst looked at the most general description of a fractional quantum Hall eﬀect, and subsequently dualised. However, it’s possible to motivate (5.38) directly. In this short section, we brieﬂy explain how. The usual construction of a Ginzburg-Landau eﬀective theory involves ﬁrst identi- fying a symmetry which is broken. The symmetry breaking is then described by an appropriate local order parameter, and the eﬀective theory is written in terms of this order parameter. If we want to do this for the quantum Hall ﬂuid, we ﬁrst need to ﬁgure out what this order parameter could possibly be. We’re going to take a hint from the theory of superﬂuidity where one works with an object called the density matrix. (Beware: this means something diﬀerent than in previous courses on quantum mechanics and quantum information). There are two, equivalent, deﬁnitions of the density matrix. First, suppose that we have some many- body system with particles created by the operator Ψ†(r). In a given state, we deﬁne the density matrix to be ρ(r, r′) = ⟨Ψ†(r)Ψ(r′)⟩ Alternatively, there is also simple deﬁnition in the ﬁrst quantised framework. Suppose that our system of N particles is described by the the wavefunction ψ(xi). We focus on the position of just a single particle, say x1 ≡ r and the density matrix is constructed as ρ(r, r′) = N ∫ N∏ i=2 dxi ψ⋆(r, x2, . . . , xN )ψ(r′, x2, . . . , xN ) The deﬁnition of a superﬂuid state is that the density matrix exhibits oﬀ-diagonal long range order. This means that ρ(r, r′) → ρ0 as |r − r′| → ∞ – 174 – Here ρ0 is the density of the superﬂuid. What does this have to do with our quantum Hall ﬂuids? They certainly don’t act like superﬂuids. And, indeed, you can check that quantum Hall ﬂuids are not superﬂuids. If you compute the density matrix for the Laughlin wavefunction (3.3), you ﬁnd ρ(z, z′) = N ∫ N∏ i=2 d2zi ∏ i (z − zi)m(¯z′ − ¯zi)m ∏ j<k |zj − zk|2me − ∑ j |zj|2/2l2 B This does not exhibit oﬀ-diagonal long-range order. The ﬁrst two terms ensure that the phase ﬂuctuates wildly and this results in exponential decay of the density matrix: ρ(z, z′) ∼ e −|z−z′|2. However, one can construct an object which does exhibit oﬀ-diagonal long-range order. This is not apparent in the electrons, but instead in the composite bosons Φ. These operators are related to the electrons by the addition of −m ﬂux units, Φ †(z) = Ψ†(z)U −m (5.40) where U is the operator which inserts a single unit of ﬂux of the gauge ﬁeld αµ. It can be shown that this is the operator which exhibits oﬀ-diagonal long-range order in the quantum Hall state 43 ⟨Φ †(z)Φ(z′)⟩ → ρ0 as |z − z′| → ∞ Alternatively, if you’re working with wavefunctions, you need to include a singular gauge transformation to implement the ﬂux attachment. Note that, usually in Ginzburg-Landau theories, one is interested in phases where the order parameter condensed. Indeed, if we follow through our duality transformations, the original theory (5.36) describes quantum Hall Hall physics when φ is a gapped excitation. (This is the phase a > 0 of Theory A in the previous section). But the particle-vortex duality tells us that the dual theory (5.37) should lie in the phase in which ˜φ gets an expectation value. Equivalently, in the non-relativistic picture, Φ condenses. This kind of thinking provided the original motivation for writing down the Ginzburg- Landau theory and, ultimately, to ﬁnding the link to Chern-Simons theories. However, the presence of the ﬂux attachment in (5.40) means that Φ is not a local operator. This is one of the reasons why this approach misses some of the more subtle eﬀects such as topological order. Adding Background Gauge Fields To explore more physics, we need to re-introduce the background gauge ﬁeld Aµ into our eﬀective Lagrangian. It’s simple to re-do the integrating out with Aµ included; we ﬁnd the eﬀective Lagrangian S = ∫ d3x { iΦ †(∂0 − i(α0 + A0 + µ))Φ − 1 ±2π. From the ﬂux attachment (5.39), we see that they carry charge e ⋆ = ±1/m. This is as expected from our general arguments of particle-vortex duality: the vortices in the ZHK theory should correspond to the fundamental excitations of the original theory (5.36): these are the quasi-holes and quasi-particles. So far, we’ve seen that this dual formalism can reproduce many of the results that we saw earlier. However, the theory (5.41) provides a framework to compute much more detailed response properties of the quantum Hall ﬂuid. For most of these, it is not enough to consider just the classical theory as we’ve done above. One should take into account the quantum ﬂuctuations of the Chern-Simons ﬁeld, as well as the Coulomb interactions between electrons which we’ve buried in the potential. We won’t describe any of this here 44. 5.3.3 Composite Fermions and the Half-Filled Landau Level We can also use this Chern-Simons approach to make contact with the composite fermion picture that we met in Section 3. Recall that the basic idea was to attach an even number of vortices to each electron. In the language of Section 3, these vortices were simply zeros of the wavefunction, with holomorphicity ensuring that each zero is accompanied by a 2π winding of the phase. In the present language, we can think of the vortex attachment as ﬂux attachment. Adding an even number of ﬂuxes to an electron doesn’t change the statistics. The resulting object is the composite fermion. As we saw in Section 3.3.3, one of the most interesting predictions of the composite fermion picture arises at ν = 1/2 where one ﬁnds a compressible fermi-liquid-type state. We can write down an eﬀective action for the half-ﬁlled Landau level as follows, S = ∫ d3x { iψ†(∂0 − i(α0 + A0 + µ)ψ − 1 The action (5.42) is the starting point for the Halperin-Lee-Read theory of the half- ﬁlled Landau level. The basic idea is that an external magnetic ﬁeld B can be screened by the emergent gauge ﬁeld ˜f12, leaving the fermions free to ﬁll up a Fermi sea. However, the ﬂuctuations of the Chern-Simons gauge ﬁeld mean that the resulting properties of this metal are diﬀerent from the usual Fermi-liquid theory. It is, perhaps, the simplest example of a “non-Fermi liquid”. Many detailed calculations of properties of this state can be performed and successfully compared to experiment. We won’t describe any of this here 45. Half-Filled or Half-Empty? While the HLR theory (5.42) can claim many successes, there remains one issue that is poorly understood. When a Landau level is half full, it is also half empty. One would expect that the resulting theory would then exhibit a symmetry exchanging particles and holes. But the action (5.42) does not exhibit any such symmetry. There are a number of logical possibilities. The ﬁrst is that, despite appearances, the theory (3.41) does secretly preserve particle-hole symmetry. The second possibility is that this symmetry is spontaneously broken at ν = 1/2 and there are actually two possible states. (This turns out to be true at ν = 5/2 where the Pfaﬃan state we’ve already met has a brother, known as the anti-Pfaﬃan state). Here we will focus on a third possibility: that the theory (5.42) is not quite correct. An alternative theory was suggested by Son who proposed that the composite fermion at ν = 1/2 should be rightly viewed as a two-component Dirac fermion 46. The heart of Son’s proposal is a new duality that can be thought of as a fermionic version of the particle-vortex duality that we met in Section 5.3.1. Here we ﬁrst describe this duality. In the process of explaining how it works, we will see the connection to the half-ﬁlled Landau level. Theory A: The Dirac Fermion In d = 2 + 1 dimensions, the representation of the Cliﬀord algebra {γµ, γν} = 2ηµν has dimension 2. The gamma matrices can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices, with a useful representation given by γ0 = iσ2 , γ1 = σ1 , γ2 = σ3 Correspondingly, the Dirac spinor ψ is a two-component object with complex com- ponents. As usual, ¯ψ = ψ†γ0. (See the lectures on Quantum Field Theory for more information about the construction of spinors). Quantising the Dirac spinor in d = 2+1 dimensions gives rise to spin-up particles and spin-down anti-particles. Theory A has a global U(1) symmetry with current J µ = ¯ψγµψ (5.44) In the action (5.43), we’ve coupled this to a background electromagnetic gauge ﬁeld Aµ. Theory B: QED3 The theory (5.45) has a U(1) symmetry with the kind of current that is, by now, familiar J µ = 1 This is the new proposed dual of the half-ﬁlled Landau level. We see that there is no hint of the magnetic ﬁeld in the dual picture. Instead we get a Fermi surface which, just as in the HLR theory (5.42), is coupled to a ﬂuctuating gauge ﬁeld. However, in this new proposal this gauge ﬁeld no longer has a Chern-Simons coupling. It turns out that many, if not all, of the successful predictions of the HLR theory (5.42) also hold for QED3 (5.45). The diﬀerence between the theories two turns out to be rather subtle: the relativistic electrons in QED3 pick up an extra factor of Berry phase π as they are transported around the Fermi surface. At the time of writing, there is an ongoing eﬀort to determine whether this phase can be observed experimentally see which of these two theories is correct. 5.4 Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Theories So far we have discussed the eﬀective theories only for Abelian quantum Hall states. As we have seen, these are described by Chern-Simons theories involving emergent U(1) gauge ﬁelds. Given this, it seems plausible that the eﬀective ﬁeld theories for non-Abelian quantum Hall states involve emergent non-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge ﬁelds. This is indeed the case. Here we sketch some of the novel properties associated to non-Abelian Chern-Simons terms. 5.4.1 Introducing Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Theories We start by describing the basics of non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. Everything we say will hold for arbitrary gauge group G, but we will focus on G = SU(N). For the most prominent applications to quantum Hall physics, G = SU(2) will suﬃce. We work with Hermitian gauge connections aµ, valued in the Lie algebra. The associated ﬁeld strength is fµν = ∂µaν − ∂νaµ − i[aµ, aν] We take the basis generators in the fundamental representation with normalisation tr(T aT b) = 1 Our ﬁrst goal is to understand some simple properties of this theory. The equation of motion is fµν = 0 This is deceptively simple! Yet, as we will see, many of the subtleties arise from the interesting solutions to this equation and its generalisations. Indeed, we’ve already seen our ﬁrst hint that this equation has interesting solutions when we looked at Abelian Chern-Simons theories on the torus in Section 5.2.3. Let’s start by seeing how the Chern-Simons action fares under a gauge transforma- tion. The gauge potential transforms as aµ → g−1aµg + ig−1∂µg with g ∈ SU(N). The ﬁeld strength transforms as fµν → g−1fµνg. A simple calculation shows that the Chern-Simons action changes as SCS → SCS + k This is the same quantisation that we saw for the Abelian theory, although this re- quirement arises in a more direct fashion for the non-Abelian theory. (Note that we’re using the convention e = ℏ = 1; if we put these back in, we ﬁnd ℏk/e 2 ∈ Z). Chern-Simons Term as a Boundary Term There is one other basic property of the Chern-Simons term that is useful to know. Consider a theory in d = 3 + 1 dimensions. A natural quantity is the Pontryagin density ǫ µνρσTr(fµνfρσ). It’s not hard to show that this is a total derivative, ǫ µνρσtr(fµνfρσ) = 4ǫ µνρσ∂µ tr ( aµ∂ρaσ − 2i We’re looking for solutions to (5.50) on the background Σ. This is the problem of ﬁnding ﬂat connections on Σ and has been well studied in the mathematical literature. We oﬀer only a sketch of the solution. We already saw in Section 5.2.3 how to do this for Abelian Chern-Simons theories on a torus: the solutions are parameterised by the holonomies of ai around the cycles of the torus. The same is roughly true here. For gauge group SU(N), there are N 2 − 1 such holonomies for each cycle, but we also need to identify connections that are related by gauge transformations. The upshot is that the moduli space M of ﬂat connections has dimension (2g − 2)(N 2 − 1) where g is the genus Σ. Usually in classical mechanics, we would view the space of solutions to the constraint – such as M – as the conﬁguration space of the system. But that’s not correct in the present context. Because we started with a ﬁrst order action (5.48), the ai describe both positions and momenta of the system. This means that M is the phase space. Now, importantly, it turns out that the moduli space M is compact (admittedly with some singularities that have to be dealt with). So we’re in the slightly unusual situation of having a compact phase space. When you quantise you (very roughly) parcel the phase space up into chunks of area ℏ. Each of these chunks corresponds to a diﬀerent state in the quantum Hilbert space. This means that when you have a compact phase space, you will get a ﬁnite number of states. Of course, this is precisely what we saw for the U(1) Chern-Simons theory on a torus in Section 5.2.3. What we’re seeing here is just a fancy way of saying the same thing. So the question we need to answer is: what is the dimension of the Hilbert space H that you get from quantising SU(N) Chern-Simons theory on a manifold Σ? When Σ = S 2, the answer is easy. There are no ﬂat connections on S 2 and the quantisation is trivial. There is just a unique state: dim(H) = 1. In Section 5.4.4, we’ll see how we can endow this situation with something a little more interesting. When Σ has more interesting topology, the quantisation of Gk leads to a more inter- esting Hilbert space. When G = SU(2), it turns out that the dimension of the Hilbert space for g ≥ 1 is 49 dim(H) = (k + 2 Note that for Σ = T2, which has g = 1, this is simply dim(H) = k + 1. It’s not obvious, but nonetheless true, that the formula above gives an integer for all g. There is a generalisation of this formula for general gauge group which involves various group theoretic factors such as sums over weights. Finally, note that the dimension of the Hilbert space can be computed directly within the path integral. One simply needs to compute the partition function on the manifold S 1 × Σ, Z = ∫ Da exp [ ik of freedom of each quark and we’ll retain this language here. In general, these colour degrees of freedom span some ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. For example, if we have an object transforming in the fundamental representation of SU(N), then it will have an N-dimensional internal Hilbert space . In this section we’ll see how to describe these colour degrees of freedom for each particle. Usually this is not done. Instead, one can work in a description where the colour degrees of freedom are integrated out in the path integral, leaving behind an object called a Wilson line. The purpose of this Section is really to explain where these Wilson lines come from. In Section 5.4.4, we will return to Chern-Simons theories and study their properties in the presence of these external sources. Classically, we view each particle that is charged under the SU(N) gauge ﬁeld as carrying an internal N-component complex vector with components wγ, γ = 1, . . . , N. This vector has some special properties. First, it has a ﬁxed length w†w = κ (5.52) Second, we identify vectors which diﬀer only by a phase: wγ ∼ e iθwγ. This means that the vectors parameterise the projective space CPN −1. Let’s ignore the coupling of to the gauge ﬁeld aµ for now. The dynamics of these vectors is described by introducing an auxiliary U(1) gauge ﬁeld α which lives on the worldline of the particle. The action is Sw = ∫ dt (iw†Dtw − κα) (5.53) where Dt = ∂tw − iαw. The purpose of this gauge ﬁeld is two-fold. Firstly, we have a gauge symmetry which identiﬁes w → e iθ(t)w. This means that two vectors which diﬀer only by a phase are physically equivalent, just as we wanted. Second, the equation of motion for α is precisely the constraint equation (5.52). The net result is that wγ indeed parameterise CP N −1. Note, however, that our action is ﬁrst order, rather than second order. This means that CPN −1 is the phase space of the colour vector rather than the conﬁguration space. But this too is what we want: whenever we quantise a compact phase space, we end up with a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. – 186 – Finally, we can couple the colour degree of freedom to the Chern-Simons gauge ﬁeld. If the particle is stationary at some ﬁxed position x = X, then the action is Sw = ∫ dt (iw†Dtw − κα − w†a0(t)w) where a0(t) = a0(t, x = X) is the Chern-Simons gauge ﬁeld at the location of the particle. The equation of motion for w is then idw However, the normal ordering implicit in the symmetric choice of Q in (5.55) gives rise to a shift in the spectrum. For N even, Q takes integer values; for N odd, Q takes half-integer values. It will prove useful to introduce the shifted Chern-Simons coeﬃcient, κeﬀ = κ − N Note that we’ve called the partition function W as opposed to its canonical name Z. We’ll see the reason for this below. The insertion at t = −∞ is simply placing the particle in some particular internal state and the partition function measures the amplitude that it remains in that state at t = +∞ Having taken this into account, we next perform the path integral over w and w†. This is tantamount to summing a series of diagrams like this: + += + .... where the straight lines are propagators for wγ which are simply θ(t1 − t2)δγγ′, while the dotted lines represent insertions of the gauge ﬁelds. It’s straightforward to sum these. The ﬁnal result is something very simple: W [a0] = Tr P exp (i ∫ dt a0(t)) (5.58) Here P stands for path ordering which, since our particles are static, is the same thing as time ordering. The trace is evaluated in the fundamental representation. This is the Wilson line. It is a classical function of the gauge ﬁeld a0(t). However, as we’ve seen above, it should really be thought of as a quantum object, arising from integrating out the colour degrees of freedom of a particle. We can also generalise this construction to other symmetric representations; you simply need to insert κeﬀ factors of w† at time t = −∞ and a further κeﬀ factors of w at t = +∞. The end result is a Wilson line, with the trace evaluated in the κ th eﬀ symmetric representation. 5.4.4 Chern-Simons Theory with Wilson Lines Let’s now consider non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory with the insertion of some number of Wilson lines. Suppose that we insert n Wilson lines, each in a representation Ri and sitting at position Xi. For simplicity, we’ll consider the theory on R × S 2 where, previously, the theory had just a single state. Now we quantise in the presence of these Wilson lines. This will give a new Hilbert space that we’ll denote Hi1...in with the labels denoting both position and representation of the Wilson lines. The ﬁrst question that we want to ask is: what is the dimension of this new Hilbert space? The constraint equation in the presence of Wilson lines reads k with w(i) the colour degrees of freedom that we met in the previous section. These carry the information about the representation Ri carried by the Wilson line Let’s start by looking at the limit k → ∞. This is the weak coupling limit of the Chern-Simons theory (strictly, we need k ≫ N) so we expect a classical analysis to be valid. However, we’ll retain one element of the quantum theory: the Dirac quantisation of ﬂux (5.19), now applied to each component f a 12 individually. But, with k very large, we see that it’s impossible to reconcile Dirac quantisation with any non-trivial charge on the right-hand side. This means that the only way we can solve (5.59) is if the charges on the right-hand side can somehow add up to zero. In the language of group theory, this means that we take need to decompose the tensor product of the representations Ri into irreducible representations. We only get solutions to (5.59) only if singlets appear in this decomposition. We write ⊗ n i=1Ri = 1p ⊕ . . . where p is the number of singlets 1 appearing in the decomposition and . . . are all the non-singlet representations. Each of these diﬀerent decompositions gives rise to a diﬀerent state in the Hilbert space Hi1...in. In the weak coupling limit, we then have lim k→∞ dim(Hi1...in) = p Typically, when we have a large number n of Wilson lines, there will be several diﬀerent ways to make singlets so p ≥ 2. For ﬁnite k when quantum eﬀects become more important, one ﬁnds that dim(Hi1...in) ≤ p The possible reduction of the number of states arises in an intuitive fashion through screening. At ﬁnite k, new solutions to (5.59) exist in which the integrated ﬂux is non-zero. But we should sum over ﬂux sectors in the path integral which means that these states become indistinguishable from the vacuum. This not only cuts down the dimension of the Hilbert space, but reduces the kinds of representations that we can insert to begin with. Let’s illustrate this idea with some simple examples: An Example: SU(2)k For G = SU(2), representations are labelled by the spin s. Classically, of course, s can take any half-integer value. There is no bound on how large the spin can be. However, at ﬁnite k the spin is bounded by 0 ≤ s ≤ k The insertion of any Wilson line with spin s > k/2 can be screened by ﬂux so that it is equivalent to spin |s − k|. Another Example: SU(N)k. Let’s ﬁrst recall some SU(N) group theory. Irreducible representations can be char- acterised by a Young tableau with rows of length l1 ≥ l2 ≥ . . . ≥ lN −1 ≥ 0. In this notation, the fundamental representation N is simply a single box The pth symmetric representation is a row of boxes p boxes The anti-symmetric representation is a column of p boxes, while the adjoint is a full column plus an extra guy stuck on the top, p boxes and N−1 boxes In particular, the anti-fundamental representation ¯N is the same as the (N − 1)th anti-symmetric representation. The non-trivial Wilson lines at level k are simply those with l1 ≤ k. This means, in particular, that we can only have symmetric representations up to the kth power of the fundamental. (This agrees with our result (5.60) for SU(2)). However, all anti-symmetric representations are allowed. Most importantly, there are only a ﬁnite number of representations at any ﬁnite k. Fusion Revisited Having speciﬁed the allowed representations, let’s now return to the dimension of the Hilbert space Hi1...in. For two Wilson lines, the Hilbert space has dimension 1 if R1 = ¯R2, so that their tensor product can form a singlet. The ﬁrst non-trivial example arises – 191 – with the insertion of three Wilson lines with representations as Ri, Rj and ¯Rk. We’ll denote the dimension of the Hilbert space as dim(Hij¯k) = N k ij As we described above, in the classical limit N k ij is the number of times that Rk appears in the tensor product of Ri ⊗ Rj. However, it too can receive quantum corrections and, in general, N k ij will be less than its classical value. There is a well-developed machinery to compute the numbers N k ij in Chern-Simons theories. This involves replacing the tensor product of representations ⊗ with a mod- iﬁed operation called fusion. We will denote the fusion of two representations as ⋆. The number N k ij is now the number of times that Rk appears in the fusion product of Ri ⋆ Rj. From knowledge of the N k ij, we can compute the dimension of the general Hilbert space Hi1...in. It is given by dim(Hi1...in) = ∑ j1,...,jn−2 N j1 i1i2N j2 j1i3 . . . N jn−1 jn−2in We’ve seen all of this before. This is the formal structure of fusion that underlies the theory of non-Abelian anyons that we described in Section 4.3. The formula above is the same as (4.21). In general, the Hilbert space of Wilson lines in Chern-Simons theory provides a concrete realisation of the somewhat abstract fusion rules. The fusion rules for Wilson lines in Chern-Simons theories are related to the rep- resentation theory of Kac-Moody algebras. We won’t explain where these rules come from. Instead, we will just present the results 51. Fusion Rules for SU(2)k the right-hand side which are greater than k/2. You might think that we simply delete all representations in the tensor product that are too large. However, it turns out that the fusion rules are more subtle than that; sometimes we need to delete some of the representations that appear to be allowed. The correct fusion rule is r ⋆ s = |r − s| ⊕ . . . ⊕ min(k − r − s, r + s) (5.61) As an example, let’s look at SU(2)2. From (5.60), we see that there are just three possible representations, with spin j = 0, 1/2 and 1. We’ll label these representations by their dimension, 1, 2 and 3. The fusion rules (5.61) in this case are 2 ⋆ 2 = 1 ⊕ 3 , 2 ⋆ 3 = 2 , 3 ⋆ 3 = 1 (5.62) Note that the ﬁrst two of these follow from standard Clebsh-Gordan coeﬃcients, throw- ing out any spins greater than 1. However, the ﬁnal product does not have the rep- resentation 3 on the right-hand side which one might expect. We’ve seen the fusion rules (5.62) before: they are identical to the fusion of Ising anyons (4.24) with the identiﬁcation 2 → σ and 3 → ψ Recall that these describe the anyonic excitations of the Moore-Read state. Similarly, one can check how many singlets you can form from n spin-1/2 with the requirement that no group has spin greater than 1. The answer, for n even, is 2n/2−1. We recognise this as the dimension of the Hilbert space of n Ising anyons. This leads us to suspect that the SU(2)2 Chern-Simons theory plays some role in the description of the ν = 5/2 quantum Hall state. We’ll look at this in more detail shortly. Fusion Rules for SU(N)k We start by writing down the usual tensor product of representations. For each representation on the right-hand side, we draw the corresponding Young diagram and deﬁne t = l1 − k − 1 where, as before, l1 is the length of the ﬁrst row. Now we do one of three things, depending on the value of t. • t < 0: Keep this diagram. • t = 0: Throw this diagram away. • t > 0: Play. First, we remove a boundary strip of t boxes, starting from the end of the ﬁrst row and moving downwards and left. Next, we add a boundary strip of t boxes, starting at the bottom of the ﬁrst column and moving up and right. If the resulting Young diagram does not correspond to a representation of SU(N), we throw it away. Otherwise, we repeat until the resulting diagram has t ≤ 0. If t = 0, we again throw it away. However, if t < 0 then we keep it on the right-hand side, but with a sign given by (−1)r−+r++1 (5.63) where r− is the number of columns from which boxes were removed, while r+ is the number of columns which had boxes added. An Example: SU(2)2 Again This probably sounds a little baﬄing. Let’s ﬁrst see how these rules reproduce what we saw for SU(2). We’ll consider SU(2)2 which, as we saw, has representations 1, 2 and 3. In terms of Young diagrams, these are 1, □ and □□. Let’s look at some tensor products. The ﬁrst is 2 ⊗ 2 = 1 ⊕ 3 ⇒ ⊗ = 1 ⊕ Both boxes on the right-hand side have t < 0 so remain. In this case, the fusion rules are the same as the tensor product: 2 ⋆ 2 = 1 ⊕ 3. The next tensor product is 2 ⊗ 3 = 2 ⊕ 4 ⇒ ⊗ = ⊕ In this case, the ﬁnal diagram is not an allowed representation of SU(2)2. It has t = 3 − 2 − 1 = 0 so we simply discard this diagram. We’re left with the fusion rule 2 ⋆ 3 = 2. The ﬁnal tensor product is 3 ⊗ 3 = 1 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 5 ⇒ ⊗ = 1 ⊕ ⊕ (5.64) – 194 – The ﬁrst two diagrams have t < 0 and we leave them be. But the third has l1 = 4 and so t = 1. This means we can play. We remove a single box from the far right-hand end and replace it below the ﬁrst box on the left: −→ But a column of 2 boxes can be removed in SU(2) Young diagrams. So the full result is −→ −→ This is another 3 representation. But we should worry about the sign. The red box covers a single column, so r− = 1, while the green box also covers a single column so r+ = 1. This means that this diagram comes with a sign −1. This cancels oﬀ the □□ that appeared on the right-hand side of (5.64). This ﬁnal result is 3 ⋆ 3 = 1. In this way, we see that our rules for manipulating Young diagram reproduce the SU(2)2 fusion rules for Ising anyons (5.62) that we introduced previously. Another Example: SU(3)2 Let’s now look another example. We choose SU(3)2. The allowed representations are 3 = , which, in diagrams, reads ⊗ = 1 ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ The ﬁrst three diagrams we keep. The 10 and 5.4.5 Eﬀective Theories of Non-Abelian Quantum Hall States It is clear that non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories give rise to non-Abelian anyons. In- deed, as we mentioned above, for SU(2)2, the structure of anyons that arise is identical to the Ising anyons that describe the Moore-Read states. It’s therefore very natural to think they provide eﬀective ﬁeld theories for the non-Abelian quantum Hall states. And this turns out to be correct. One can argue 53 that the SU(2)2 theory eﬀectively captures the braiding of anyons in the bosonic Moore-Read state at ν = 1. However, the full description is somewhat involved. One very basic problem is as follows: to construct the full low-energy theory one should identify the electromagnetic current which couples to the background ﬁeld Aµ. And here gauge invariance works against us. The kind of trick that we used in the Abelian theory is not available for the non-Abelian theory since ǫ µνρfνρ is not gauge invariant, while ǫ µνρtrfνρ = 0. The way to proceed is to look at U(N) = U(1) × SU(N)/ZN Chern-Simons theories. The background gauge ﬁeld can easily couple to the U(1) factor but we then need the U(1) factor to couple to the rest of SU(N) somehow. This is the part which is a little involved: it requires some discrete identiﬁcations of the allowed Wilson lines in a way which is compatible with gauge invariance 54. However, the Chern-Simons theories also provide us with another way to look at quantum Hall states since these theories are intimately connected to d = 1 + 1 dimen- sional conformal ﬁeld theories. And it will turn out that these conformal ﬁeld theories also capture many of the interesting aspects of quantum Hall physics. In our ﬁnal section, we will look at this for some simple examples. 6. Edge Modes If a quantum Hall ﬂuid is conﬁned to a ﬁnite region, there will be gapless modes that live on the edge. We’ve already met these in Section 2.1 for the integer quantum Hall states where we noticed that they are chiral: they propagate only in one direction. This is a key property shared by all edge modes. In this section we’ll describe the edge modes for the fractional quantum Hall states. At ﬁrst glance it may seem like this is quite an esoteric part of the story. However, there’s a surprise in store. The edge modes know much more about the quantum Hall states than you might naively imagine. Not only do they oﬀer the best characterisation of these states, but they also provide a link between the Chern-Simons approach and the microscopic wavefunctions. 6.1 Laughlin States We start by looking at edge modes in the ν = 1/m Laughlin states. The basic idea is that the ground state forms an incompressible disc. The low-energy excitations of this state are deformations which change its shape, but not its area. These travel as waves around the edge of the disc, only in one direction. In what follows, we will see this picture emerging from several diﬀerent points of view. 6.1.1 The View from the Wavefunction Let’s ﬁrst return to the description of the quantum Hall state in terms of the microscopic wavefunction. Recall that when we were discussing the toy Hamiltonians in Section 3.1.3, the Hamiltonian Htoy that we cooked up in (3.15) had the property that the zero energy ground states are ψ(zi) = s(zi) ∏ i<j (zi − zj)m e − ∑i |zi|2/4l2 B (6.1) for any symmetric polynomial s(zi). The Laughlin wavefunction with s(zi) = 1 has the property that it is the most compact of these states. Equivalently, it is the state with the lowest angular momentum. We can pick this out as the unique ground state by adding a placing the system in a conﬁning potential which we take to be the angular momentum operator J, Vconﬁning = ωJ The Laughlin state, with s(zi) = 1, then has ground state energy E0 = ω where N is the number of electrons. What about the excited states? We can write down a basis of symmetric polynomials sn(zi) = ∑ i zn i The most general state (6.1) has polynomial s(zi) = ∞∑ n=1 sn(zi)dn which has energy E = E0 + ω ∞∑ n=1 ndn (6.2) We see that each polynomial sn contributes an energy En = ωn We’re going to give an interpretation for this. Here we’ll simply pull the interpretation out of thin air, but we’ll spend the next couple of sections providing a more direct derivation. The idea is to interpret this as the Kaluza-Klein spectrum as a gapless d = 1 + 1 scalar ﬁeld. We’ll think of this scalar as living on the edge of the quantum Hall droplet. Recall that the Laughlin state has area A = 2πmNl2 B which means that the boundary is a circle of circumference L = 2π√ d2 = 1. And for ∆E = 3ω there are 3 states: d1 = 3, or d1 = 1 and d2 = 2, or d3 = 1. In general, the number of states at energy ∆E = qω is the number of partitions of the integer q. This is the number of ways of writing q as a sum of positive integers. It is usually denoted as P (q), Degeneracy of states with ∆E = aω } = P (q) (6.3) Now let’s compare this to the Fourier modes of a scalar ﬁeld. Suppose that we focus on the modes that only move one way around the circle, labelled by the momenta n > 0. Then there’s one way to create a state with energy E = 2πv/L: we excite the ﬁrst Fourier mode once. There are two ways to create a state with energies E = 4πv/L: we excite the ﬁrst Fourier mode twice, or we excite the second Fourier mode once. And so on. What we’re seeing is that the degeneracies match the quantum Hall result (6.3) if we restrict the momenta to be positive. If we allowed the momenta to also be positive, we would not get the correct degeneracy of the spectrum. This is our ﬁrst hint that the edge modes are described by a chiral scalar ﬁeld, propagating only in one direction. 6.1.2 The View from Chern-Simons Theory Let’s see how this plays out in the eﬀective Chern-Simons theory. We saw in Section 5.2 that the low-energy eﬀective action for the Laughlin state is SCS[a] = m telling us that we should specify some boundary condition if we want to make the theory well deﬁned. For our Chern-Simons theory, a variation of the ﬁelds gives δSCS = m everywhere. The easiest way to deal with this is to work in new coordinates t ′ = t , x ′ = x + vt , y′ = y (6.7) The Chern-Simons action is topological and so invariant under such coordinate trans- formations if we also transform the gauge ﬁelds as a ′ t′ = at − vax , a ′ x′ = ax , a ′ y′ = ay (6.8) so the gauge ﬁxing condition (6.6) becomes simply a ′ t′ = 0 (6.9) But now this is easy to deal with. The constraint imposed by the gauge ﬁxing condition is simply f ′ x′y′ = 0. Solutions to this are simply a ′ i = ∂iφ with i = x ′, y′. Of course, usually such solutions would be pure gauge. But that’s what we wanted: a mode that was pure gauge which becomes dynamical. To see how this happens, we simply need to insert this solution back into the Chern-Simons action which, having set a ′ t′ = 0, is SCS = m then the equation of motion is simply ∂tρ(x, t) − v∂xρ(x, t) = 0 (6.12) This is the expression for a chiral wave propagating at speed v. The equation has solutions of the form ρ(x + vt). However, waves propagating in the other direction, described by ρ(x − vt) are not solutions. The upshot of this analysis is that the U(1) Chern-Simons theory has a chiral scalar ﬁeld living on the boundary. This, of course, is the same conclusion that we came to by studying the excitations above the Laughlin state. The Interpretation of ρ There’s a nice physical interpretation of the chiral ﬁeld ρ. To see this, recall that our Chern-Simons theory is coupled to a background gauge ﬁeld Aµ through the coupling SJ = ∫ d3x AµJ µ = 1 Integrating the ﬁrst term by parts gives ∂t′φ = ∂tφ − v∂xφ. (Recall that ∂t′ transforms like a ′ t′ and so is not the same thing as ∂t). But this vanishes or, at least, is a constant by the equation of motion (6.11). We’ll set this term to zero. We’re left with SJ = 1 This possibility allows us to capture some new physics. Consider the more realistic situation where the quantum Hall ﬂuid forms a disc and the boundary is a circle S 1 of circumference L. We’ll denote the coordinate around the boundary as σ ∈ [0, L). The total charge on the boundary is Q = ∫ L 0 dσ ρ = 1 In this section, our goal is to quantise this theory. It’s clear from (6.15) that the momentum conjugate to φ is proportional to ∂σφ. If you just naively go ahead and write down canonical commutation relations then there’s an annoying factor of 2 that you’ll get wrong, arising from the fact that there is a constraint on phase space. To avoid this, the simplest thing to do is to work with Fourier modes in what follows. Because these modes live on a circle of circumference L, we can write φ(σ, t) = 1 This ﬁnal equation is an example of a U(1) Kac-Moody algebra. It’s a provides a powerful constraint on the dynamics of conformal ﬁeld theories. We won’t have much use for this algebra in the present context, but its non-Abelian extension plays a much more important role in WZW conformal ﬁeld theories. These commutation relations can be translated back to equal-time commutation relations for the continuum ﬁelds. They read [φ(σ), φ(σ′)] = πi We claim that the operator describing an electron in the boundary is Ψ = : e imφ : (6.19) where the dots denote normal ordering, which means that all φ−n, with n positive, are moved to the right. In the language of conformal ﬁeld theory, exponentials of this type are called vertex operators. To see that this operator carries the right charge, we can use the commutation relation (6.17) to show that [ρ(σ), Ψ†(σ′)] = Ψ†(σ′) δ(σ − σ′) and [ρ(σ), Ψ(σ′)] = −Ψ(σ′) δ(σ − σ′) which tells us that Ψ† inserts an object of unit charge while Ψ removes an object of unit charge. This looks good. However, there’s something rather surprising about the formula (6.19). The ﬁeld φ is a boson, but if Ψ is really the electron operator then it should be a fermion. To see that this is indeed the case, we use the Baker-Campbell- Hausdorﬀ formula to get Ψ(σ)Ψ(σ′) = e −m2[φ(σ),φ(σ′)]Ψ(σ′)Ψ(σ) The commutator of φ was given in (6.16). We ﬁnd that when σ ̸= σ′, [Ψ(σ), Ψ(σ′)] = 0 m even {Ψ(σ), Ψ(σ′)} = 0 m odd We see that the ﬁeld Φ acts like a boson if m is even and a fermion if m is odd. But we know from the Laughlin wavefunction that the objects underlying the quantum Hall state are bosons when m is even and fermions when m is odd. Miraculously, our edge theory knows about the nature of the underlying constituents in the bulk. The formula (6.19) is one of the key formulas in the subject of bosonisation, in which fermions in d = 1 + 1 dimensions can be written in terms of bosons and vice versa. It should be clear that the electron operator (6.19) is not the simplest operator that we can construct in our theory. Since φ has periodicity 2π, it also makes sense to look at the operator Ψqp = : e iφ : (6.20) No prizes are awarded for guessing that this corresponds to the quasi-particle excitations in the quantum Hall ﬂuid. The commutator with ρ [ρ(σ), Ψ† qp(σ′)] = 1 tells us that these operators create particles with charge ±1/m. The statistics of these operators can be seen by commuting Ψqp(σ)Ψqp(σ′) = e −[φ(σ),φ(σ′)]Ψqp(σ′)Ψqp(σ) = e ±πi/mΨqp(σ′)Ψqp(σ) We see that the particles are anyons, with statistical phase e ±πi/m as expected. In this approach, the sign of the phase depends on the sign(σ − σ′). This is analogous to the way the sign depends on whether to do a clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation in the bulk. Propagators Let’s now turn to the propagators, starting with the compact boson φ. Deriving the propagator directly from the action (6.10) involves a ﬁddly contour integral. However, the answer is straightforward and simple to understand intuitively: it is simply the left-moving part of the propagator for a normal boson. Let’s start from action S = m The logarithmic dependence seen in (6.21) reﬂects the fact that there are infra-red divergences if we work with massless scalar ﬁelds in d = 1 + 1. It’s telling us that the physical information is carried by other ﬁelds. The propagator for the charge density follows immediately from diﬀerentiating (6.21), ⟨ ρ(x + vt)ρ(0) ⟩ = − 1 Applying this to the whole string of operators in (6.23), we have : e A1 :: e A2 : . . . : e AN : = e (β1+...+βN )a†e (α1+...+αN )a e ∑i<j αiβj = : e A1+...+AN : e ∑ i<j ⟨0|AiAj |0⟩ (6.24) Taking the expectation value of both sides, we have our ﬁnal result ⟨0| : e A1 :: e A2 : . . . : e AN : |0⟩ = exp (∑ i<j ⟨0|AiAj|0⟩ ) (6.25) This is the result that we want. Let’s now see what it means for our electrons on the edge. The Electron Propagator Because the free ﬁeld φ is simply a collection of harmonic oscillators, we can apply the formula (6.25) to vertex operators like (6.19). We have GF (x + vt) = ⟨ Ψ†(x, t)Ψ(0, 0) ⟩ = exp (m 2⟨ φ(x, t)φ(0, 0) ⟩) Using (6.21), we ﬁnd that the electron Green’s function is given by GF (x, t) ∼ 1 electron in the Standard model. The resulting theory usually goes by the name of the chiral Luttinger liquid 55. The most important information to take from the propagator (6.26) comes from some simple dimensional analysis. Comparing both sides, we learn that the electron operator Ψ has dimension m/2. This should be contrasted with the usual value of 1/2 The fact that electrons are fermions means that m has to be odd. But this means that the exponent in the propagator can’t change continuously as the Hamiltonian underlying the quantum Hall state varies. For this reason, the dimension of the edge operator can be viewed as a characterisation of the bulk state. It can only change if the bulk goes through a phase transition. 6.1.5 Tunnelling The electron propagator (6.26) has some surprisingly physical consequences. There is a long and detailed literature on this subject. Here we provide only a baby version to explain the basic physics. Suppose we connect the edge of the quantum Hall ﬂuid to a wire, but put a small insulating material in between. This kind of set-up goes by the name of a tunnel junction. It means that if electrons want to get from the one side to the other, they have to tunnel. The way to model this in our theory is to add the interaction Stunnel = τ ∫ dt e imφ(0,t) Ψ† e(0, t) + h.c. where Ψ† e is the creation operator for the electron in the wire. Here we’ve inserted the junction at the point σ = 0 on the edge. The strength of the tunnelling is governed by the coupling constant τ . The action must be dimensionless (in units with ℏ = 1). We learned above that e imφ has dimen- sion m/2. Meanwhile Ψe refers to a “common or garden” electron in a wire and has dimension 1/2. This means that the dimension of τ must be [τ ] = 1 − m temperature where we can work perturbatively. We can use dimensional analysis to determine the way various quantities scale. In d = 1+1, the conductivity has dimension [σ] = −1, but this means that the conductance G is dimensionless: [G] = 0. Fermi’s golden rule tells us that the lowest order contribution to the tunnelling con- ductance G scales as τ 2. The deﬁcit in dimensions must be made up by temperature T , simply because there’s no other scale in the game. We have G ∼ τ 2 T m−1 Alternatively, if we’re at zero temperature then the current is driven by a voltage V . We have [I] = 1 and [V ] = 1, so we I ∼ τ 2 V m (6.27) This ﬁnal result is particularly striking as violates the form Figure 46: of Ohm’s law, V = IR, that we all learned in high school. This prediction has been successfully tested for the ν = 1/3 quantum Hall state. The data shown in the ﬁgure 56 ﬁts the solid line which matches (6.27) with m ≈ 2.7. We can also play variants on this game. For example, suppose that we add a tunnel junction between two Hall ﬂuids of the same type. Now the interaction is Stunnel = τ ∫ dt e imφ1(0,t) e −imφ2(0,t) + h.c. This time we have [τ ] = 1 − m and, correspondingly, we have G ∼ τ 2 T 2m−2 and I ∼ τ 2 V 2m−1 Quasi-Particle Tunnelling It’s also possible to set up a situation where the quasi-particles can tunnel. We do this by taking a single Hall ﬂuid and putting in a constriction as shown in the ﬁgure. Because the bulk supports quasi-particles, these can tunnel from the top edge to the bottom. The tunnelling interaction is now Stunnel = τ ∫ dt e iφ1(0,t) e −iφ2(0,t) + h.c. To ﬁgure out the dimension of τ in this case, we ﬁrst need Figure 47: A Constric- tion the dimension of the quasi-particle operator. Repeating the calculation that led to (6.26) tells us that [e iφ] = 1/2m, so now we have [τ ] = 1 − 1 In this framework, the fact that the boson is chi- Figure 48: ral translates to the statement that φ is a holo- morphic function of z, so φ = φ(z). One can check that the propagator (6.21) takes the same form, which now reads ⟨ φ(z)φ(w) ⟩ = − 1 The upshot of this argument is that a correlation function involving only electron operators does not give us the Laughlin wavefunction. Instead, it vanishes. To get something non-zero, we need to insert another operator into the correlation function. We will look at G(zi, ¯zi) = ⟨ Ψ(z1) . . . Ψ(zN ) exp ( − ρ0 ∫ γ d2z′ φ(z′)) ⟩ (6.30) This is often said to be inserting a background charge into the correlation function. We take ρ0 = 1/2πl2 B. Note that this is the same as the background charge density (3.10) that we found when discussing the plasma analogy. Meanwhile, γ is a disc-shaped region of radius R, large enough to encompass all point zi. Now the requirement that the correlation function is invariant under the shift φ → φ + α tells us that it can be non-zero only if mN = ρ0 ∫ γ d2z′ = πR2ρ0 Using ρ0 = 1/2πl2 B, we see that we should take R = √ zi t ω i t Figure 49: The wavefunction lives here Figure 50: The correlation function lives here where the size of the disc γ must now be extended so that the system remains charge neutral. The same calculations as above now yield ˜G(zi, ¯zi; ηa, ¯ηa) = ∏ a<b(ηa − ηb)1/m ∏ a,i (zi − ηa) ∏ k<l(zk − zl)m e − ∑ i |zi|2/4l2 B −∑ a |ηa|2/4ml2 B This is the Laughlin wavefunction for the quasi-hole excitations. Note that we’ve recovered the wavefunction in the form (3.30) where the Berry phase vanishes. Instead the correlation function is not single valued and all the statistical phases that arise from braiding the quasi-hole positions are explicit. What the Hell Just Happened? It’s been a long journey. But ﬁnally, after travelling through Chern-Simons theories and the theory of edge states, we’ve come right back to where we started: the Laughlin wavefunction 58. How did this happen? It seems like magic! The most glaring issue in identifying the correlation function with the wavefunction is that the two live in diﬀerent spaces. Our quantum Hall ﬂuid lives on a disc, so spacetime is a cylinder as shown in the ﬁgures. The wavefunction is deﬁned on a spatial slice at a ﬁxed time; this is the blue disc in the ﬁgure. In the wavefunction, the positions zi lies within this disc as shown in the left-hand ﬁgure. Meanwhile, the conformal ﬁeld theory lives on the boundary. The operators inserted in the correlation function sit at positions wi = 2πσ/L + it which are subsequently mapped to the plane by z = e −iω. Why should we identify the positions in these two diﬀerent spaces? The answer is that there are actually two diﬀerent ways in which the Chern-Simons theory is related to the CFT. This arises because the bulk Chern-Simons theory is topological, which means that you can cut it in diﬀerent way and get the same answer. Above we’ve considered cutting the bulk along a timelike boundary to give a CFT in d = 1 + 1 dimensions. This, of course, is what happens in a physical system. However, we could also consider an alternative way to slice the bulk along a spacelike section, as in the left-hand ﬁgure above. This gives the same CFT, but now Wick rotated to d = 2 + 0 dimensions. We will discuss this imminently in Section 6.2.2. This new perspective will make us slightly more comfortable about why bulk wavefunctions are related to this boundary CFT. Before describing this new perspective, let me also mention a separate surprise about the relationship between correlation functions and the Laughlin wavefunction. Our original viewpoint in Section 3 was that there was nothing particularly special about the Laughlin wavefunction; it is simply a wavefunction that is easy to write down which lives in the right universality class. Admittedly it has good overlap with the true ground state for low number of electrons, but it’s only the genuine ground state for artiﬁcial toy Hamiltonians. But now we learn that there is something special about this state: it is the correlation function of primary operators in the boundary theory. I don’t understand what to make of this. Practically speaking, the connection between bulk wavefunctions and boundary cor- relation functions has proven to be a very powerful tool. It is conjectured that this correspondence extends to all quantum Hall states. First, this means that you don’t need to guess quantum Hall wavefunctions anymore. Instead you can just guess a boundary CFT and compute its correlation functions. But there’s a whole slew of CFTs that people have studied. We’ll look at another example in Section 6.3. Second, it turns out that the CFT framework is most useful for understanding the properties of quantum Hall states, especially those with non-Abelian anyons. The braiding prop- erties of anyons are related to well-studied properties of CFTs. We’ll give some ﬂavour of this in Section 6.4. 6.2.2 Wavefunction for Chern-Simons Theory Above we saw how the boundary correlation functions of the CFT capture the bulk Laughlin wavefunctions. But the origins of this connection appear completely myste- rious. Although we won’t give a full explanation of this result, we will at least try to – 218 – motivate why one may expect the boundary theory to know about the bulk wavefunc- tion. As we described above, the key is to consider a diﬀerent cut of the Chern-Simons theory. With this in mind, we will place Chern-Simons theory on R × S 2 where R is time and S 2 is a compact spatial manifold which no longer has a boundary. Instead, we will consider the system at some ﬁxed time. But in any quantum system, the kind of object that sits at a ﬁxed time is a wavefunction. We will see how the wavefunction of Chern-Simons theory is related to the boundary CFT. We’re going to proceed by implementing a canonical quantisation of U(1)m Chern- Simons theory. We already did this for Abelian Chern-Simons theory in Section 5.2.3. Working in a0 = 0 gauge, the canonical commutation relations (5.49) [ai(x), aj(y)] = 2πi Meanwhile, the az act as a momentum type operator, a a z = 4π where D¯zφ = ∂¯zφ − a¯z The extra term in this action takes the form a¯zρ, which is what we wanted. Moreover, the form of the covariant derivative tells us that we’ve essentially gauged the shift symmetry φ → φ + constant which was responsible for the existence of the charge in the ﬁrst place. Note that, although we’ve given the gauge ﬁeld the same name as in the Chern-Simons calculation above, they are (at this stage) rather diﬀerent objects. The Chern-Simons gauge ﬁeld is dynamical but, in the equation above, a¯z(z, ¯z) is some ﬁxed function. We will see shortly why it’s sensible to give them the same name. The action (6.34) looks rather odd. We’ve promoted ∂¯z into a covariant derivative D¯z but not ∂z. This is because we’re dealing with a chiral boson rather than a normal boson. It has an important consequence. The equation of motion from (6.34) is ∂¯z∂zφ = 1 Finally, note that we’ve seen the equation (6.36) before; it is the Schr¨odinger equation (6.33) for the Chern-Simons theory. Because they solve the same equation, we can equate Ψ(a¯z) = Z[a¯z] (6.37) This is a lovely and surprising equation. It provides a quantitative relationship between the boundary correlation functions, which are generated by Z[a], and the bulk Chern- Simons wavefunction. The relationship (6.37) says that the bulk vacuum wavefunction a¯z is captured by correlation functions of ρ ∼ ∂φ. This smells like what we want, but it isn’t quite the same. Our previous calculation looked at correlation functions of vertex operators e imφ. One might expect that these are related to bulk wavefunctions in the presence of Wilson lines. This is what we have seen coincides with our quantum Hall wavefunctions. The bulk-boundary correspondence that we’ve discussed here is reminiscent of what happens in gauge/gravity duality. The relationship (6.37) is very similar to what hap- pens in the ds/CFT correspondence (as opposed to the AdS/CFT correspondence). In spacetimes which are asymptotically de Sitter, the bulk Hartle-Hawking wavefunction at spacelike inﬁnity is captured by a boundary Euclidean conformal ﬁeld theory. Wavefunction for Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Theories The discussion above generalises straightforwardly to non-Abelian Chern-Simons theo- ries. Although we won’t need this result for our quantum Hall discussion, it is important enough to warrant comment. The canonical commutation relations were given in (5.48) and, in complex coordinates, read [a a z(z, ¯z), a b ¯z(w, ¯w)] = 4π 6.3 Fermions on the Boundary In this section we give another example of the bulk/boundary correspondence. However, we’re not going to proceed systematically by ﬁguring out the edge modes. Instead, we’ll ask the question: what happens when you have fermions propagating on the edge? We will that this situation corresponds to the Moore-Read wavefunction. We’ll later explain the relationship between this and the Chern-Simons eﬀective theories that we described in Section 5. 6.3.1 The Free Fermion In d = 1 + 1 dimensions, a Dirac fermion ψ is a two-component spinor. The action for a massless fermion is S = 1 χ(σ), then it can be decomposed in Fourier modes as χ(σ) = √ As we will see, various aspects of the physics depend on which of these boundary conditions we use. This is clear already when compute the propagators. These are simplest for the NS boundary condition, where χ is single valued on the plane. The propagator can be computed from the anti-commutation relations (6.40), ⟨ χ(z)χ(w) ⟩ = ∑ n,m∈Z+ 1 One reason for mentioning this connection is that it ﬁnally explains the name “Ising anyons” that we gave to the quasi-particles of the Moore-Read state. In particular, the “fusion rules” that we met in Section 4.3 have a precise analog in conformal ﬁeld theories. (What follows involves lots of conformal ﬁeld theory talk that won’t make much sense if you haven’t studied the subject.) In this context, a basic tool is the operator product expansion (OPE) between diﬀerent operators. Every operator lives in a conformal family determined by a primary operator. The fusion rules are the answer to the question: if I know the family that two operators live in, what are the families of operators that can appear in the OPE? For the Ising model, there are two primary operators other than the identity: these are χ and σ. The fusion rules for the associated families are σ ⋆ σ = 1 ⊕ χ , σ ⋆ χ = σ , χ ⋆ χ = 1 But we’ve seen these equations before: they are precisely the fusion rules for the Ising anyons (4.24) that appear in the Moore-Read state (although we’ve renamed ψ in (4.24) as χ). Of course, none of this is coincidence. As we will now see, we can reconstruct the Moore-Read wavefunction from correlators in a d = 1 + 1 ﬁeld theory that includes the free fermion. 6.3.2 Recovering the Moore-Read Wavefunction Let’s now see how to write the Moore-Read wavefunction ψM R(zi, ¯zi) = Pf ( 1 which is just what we want. The piece that remains is simply a Laughlin wavefunction and we know how to build this from a chiral boson with propagator ⟨ φ(z)φ(w) ⟩ = − 1 When m = 1, the propagator (6.42) for the chiral boson has no fractional piece in its normalisation. Or, said another way, if we normalise the action canonically, so we rescale φ → √ larger, such as a current algebra) that appear in a given conformal ﬁeld theory. Each of these representations can be labelled by a highest-weight state called a primary operator, Oi. A rational conformal ﬁeld theory is one which has a ﬁnite number of these primary operators. Next up, we need to deﬁne fusion. We already met this brieﬂy in the previous section in the context of the Ising model. If you have two operators which live within representations associated to the primary operators Oi and Oj respectively, then the operator product expansion can contain operators in other representations associated to Ok. We write these fusion rules, following (4.20), as Oi ⋆ Oj = ∑ k N k ij Ok where N k ij are integers. Similarly, we can deﬁne braiding matrices for a CFT. The general idea of the braiding is as follows. Consider a CFT which has both left-moving and right-moving modes. In general, correlation functions of primary operators can be decomposed as ⟨ N∏ i=1 Oi(zi, ¯zi) ⟩ = ∑ p |Fp(zi)|2 Here the Fp(zi) are multi-branched analytic functions of the zi which depend on the set of list of operators inserted on the left-hand-side. They are known as conformal blocks. In a rational conformal ﬁeld theory (which is deﬁned to have a ﬁnite number of primary operators) the sum over p runs over a ﬁnite range. Now vary the zi, which has the eﬀect of exchanging the particles. (In the context of the quantum Hall wavefunctions, we would exchange the positions of the quasi-hole insertions.) The conformal blocks will be analytically continued onto diﬀerent branches. However, the ﬁnal answer can be written in terms of some linear combination of the original function. This linear map is analogous to the braiding of anyons. One of the main results of Moore and Seiberg is that there are consistency relations on the kinds of braiding that can arise. These are precisely the pentagon and hexagon relations that we described in Section 4.3. We’ve already seen two examples of this. For the Laughlin states with quasi-holes, there is a single conformal block but it is multi-valued due to the presence of the factor ∏ (ηi−ηj)1/m involving the quasi-hole positions η. Meanwhile, for the Moore-Read state there are multiple conformal blocks corresponding to the diﬀerent wavefunctions (4.6). – 229 – In both these cases, the conformal ﬁeld theory gave the wavefunction in a form in which all the monodromy properties are explicit and there is no further contribution from the Berry phase. (Recall the discussion at the end of Section 3.2.3.) It is conjectured that this is always the case although, to my knowledge, there is no proof of this. WZW Models The most important conformal ﬁeld theories for our purposes are known as WZW models. (The initials stand for Wess, Zumino and Witten. Sometimes Novikov’s name breaks the symmetry and they are called WZNW models.) Their importance stems in large part from their relationship to non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. These models describe the modes which live at the edge of a non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory with boundary. Further, it turns out that the braiding of their conformal blocks coincides with the braiding of Wilson lines in the Chern-Simons theory that we brieﬂy described in Section 5.4.4. The WZW models are deﬁned by the choice of gauge group G, which we will take to be SU(N), and a level k ∈ Z. These theories are denoted as SU(N)k. The CFT for a compact boson that we met in Section 6.2.1 is a particularly simple example of a WZW model model with U(1)m. Unusually for conformal ﬁeld theories, WZW models have a Lagrangian description which can be derived using the basic method that we saw in Section 6.1.2 for U(1) Chern-Simons theories. The Lagrangian is S = k The central charge of the SU(N)k WZW model is c = k(N 2 − 1) In fact, we’ve already seen the answer to this in Section 5.4.4: the primary operators are the same as the non-trivial Wilson lines allowed in the bulk. For G = SU(2), this means that the primary operators are labelled by their spin j = 0, 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
