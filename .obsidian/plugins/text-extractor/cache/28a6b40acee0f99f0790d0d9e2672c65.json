This eﬀort is one part of a series of works that perform an extensive review of redshifts, peculiar velocities, photometric calibration, and intrinsic-scatter models of SNe Ia. The total number of light curves, which are compiled across 18 diﬀerent surveys, is a signiﬁcant increase from the ﬁrst Pantheon analysis (1048 SNe), particularly at low redshift (z). Furthermore, unlike in the Pantheon analysis, we include light curves for SNe with z < 0.01 such that SN systematic covariance can be included in a joint measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter (w). We use the large sample to compare properties of 151 SNe Ia observed by multiple surveys and 12 pairs/triplets of “SN siblings” — SNe found in the same host galaxy. Distance measurements, application of bias corrections, and inference of cosmological parameters are discussed in the companion daniel.scolnic@duke.edu dillon.brout@cfa.harvard.eduarXiv:2112.03863v2 [astro-ph.CO] 7 Feb 2022 2 paper by Brout et al. (2022b), and the determination of H0 is discussed by Riess et al. (2022). These analyses will measure w with ∼ 3% precision and H0 with ∼ 1 km/s/Mpc precision. Keywords: supernovae, cosmology 1. INTRODUCTION Measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were essential to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). Since then, the continually growing sample size of these special “standardizable candles” has strengthened a key pillar of our understanding of the standard model of cosmology in which the universe is dominated by dark energy and dark matter. While modern transient sur- veys are now discovering as many SNe Ia in 5 yr as had been discovered in the last 40 yr (e.g., Smith et al. 2020; Dhawan et al. 2021; Jones et al. 2021), progress in using these data for constraining cosmological parame- ters has been made by the compilation of multiple sam- ples (e.g., Betoule et al. 2014; Scolnic et al. 2018; Brout et al. 2019a; Jones et al. 2019). The reason for this is that diﬀerent surveys are optimized to discover and measure SNe in diﬀerent redshift ranges, and the con- straints on cosmological parameters beneﬁt from lever- aging measurements at diﬀerent redshifts. In this paper, we present the latest compilation of spectroscopically- conﬁrmed SNe Ia, which we call Pantheon+; this sam- ple is a direct successor of the Pantheon analysis (Scolnic et al. 2018), which itself succeeded the Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA; Betoule et al. 2014). In the past, measurements of the equation-of-state pa- rameter of dark energy (w) and the expansion rate of the universe (H0) have been done separately (e.g., Riess et al. 2016; Scolnic et al. 2018), even though both rely on many of the same SNe Ia. One reason for this split is that the determination of these two parameters is based on comparing SNe Ia in diﬀerent redshift ranges. For H0, SNe Ia in very nearby galaxies with z ≲ 0.01 that have calibrated distance measurements are compared to those in the “Hubble ﬂow” at 0.023 < z < 0.15, ignoring higher redshifts. For w, measurements typically utilize SNe Ia up to z ≈ 2, but exclude those at z < 0.01. Thus, only SNe Ia within one of the three ranges, those at 0.023 < z < 0.15, are common to both analyses. Here we perform a single analysis of discovered SNe Ia measured over the entire redshift range, from z = 0 to z = 2.3. This work spawns a number of analyses which include the w measurement presented by Brout et al. (2022b, in prep., hereafter B22b) as well as the H0 measurement of Riess et al. (2022, in prep., hereafter R22). R22 additionally depend on Cepheid and geomet- ric distance measurements, which make up what is called the “ﬁrst rung” of the distance ladder, whereas Cepheid measurements and z < 0.01 SN measurements make up the “second rung,” and SN measurements along with their redshifts make up the “third rung.” Both Cepheids and SNe are used in two of the three rungs. Further- more, the SNe discussed here can be used to measure growth of structure, as indicated by the model compar- isons by Peterson et al. (2021) and for measurements of anisotropy discussed by B22b. A review of many po- tential cosmological measurements possible with large SN Ia samples is given by Scolnic et al. (2019). Measurements of SN Ia light curves by diﬀerent sur- veys can be accumulated to improve their constraining power on cosmological inferences because (1) the SNe can be uniformly standardized using their light-curve shapes and colors, and any dependence of the standard- ization properties with redshift can be measured; and (2) properties of the photometric systems and observa- tions of tertiary standards are typically given so that current analyses can recalibrate the systems (e.g., Scol- nic et al. 2015; Currie et al. 2020) and reﬁt light curves. This latter point, when used with an analysis of SN surveys in aggregate, yields the ability to quantify and reduce survey-to-survey calibration errors. This is ex- plored by Brout et al. (2022a, in prep., hereafter B22a), who present a new cross-calibration of the photometric systems used in this analysis and the resulting recali- bration of the SALT2 light-curve model. Brownsberger et al. (2021) show that while measurements of H0 are particularly robust to calibration errors of SNe Ia, this is not the case for measurements of w. In this paper, we analyze measurements of the same SNe from diﬀer- ent surveys as an alternate test on the accuracy of our calibration. The large size of this sample also allows us to com- pare “sibling SNe” — that is, SNe belonging to the same host galaxy. As shown in various studies (Scol- nic et al. 2020; Burns et al. 2020; Biswas et al. 2021), sibling SNe provide powerful tests of our understand- ing of the relationships between SN properties and their host galaxies. With this large compilation, we can in- crease the statistics of sibling pairs (and triples). Our ﬁndings on the consistency of the distance modulus val- ues determined for sibling SNe, as well as the consis- tency of distance measurements of SNe from diﬀerent samples, can be used to improve the construction of the distance-covariance matrix between SNe. This matrix is 3 described by B22b, and relates the covariance between distance measurements of SNe due to various systematic uncertainties. Lastly, this paper documents the data release of stan- dardized SNe Ia for the Pantheon+ sample. A compan- ion paper by (Carr et al. 2021, hereafter C22) performs a comprehensive review of all the redshifts used and also corrects a small number of SNe with incorrect meta- properties (e.g., location, host association, naming), all included here. We note that this compilation includes light curves that have not been published elsewhere and light curves that have been provided individually as the focus of a single paper, as well as the larger samples from speciﬁc surveys. The compilation presented here attempts to homogenize the presentation and documen- tation of these light curves. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the light-curve samples released as part of the Pantheon+ compilation. Section 3 presents the light-curve ﬁts, the selection requirements (data quality cuts), and the properties of the host galaxies. We dis- cuss in Section 4 trends of the ﬁtted and host-galaxy parameters, as well as new studies of SN siblings and duplicate SNe. Section 5 presents our discussions and conclusions. Importantly, in the Appendix, we describe the format of the data release itself. 2. DATA The Pantheon+ sample comprises 18 diﬀerent sam- ples, where a sample is loosely deﬁned as the dataset produced by a single SN survey over a discrete period of time. The samples and their references, as well as their redshift ranges, are given in Table 1. In the Ap- pendix, we give an overview of each sample where we detail the original data-release paper, the location of the data, and the photometric system of the SNe. This table should be combined with the tables in Appendix A in B22a that have the information for the photomet- ric systems and information on stellar catalogs used for cross-calibration. Here we review the main changes since the ﬁrst Pantheon release. We have added 6 large samples: Foundation Supernova Survey (Foundation; Foley et al. 2018), the Swift Optical/Ultraviolet Supernova Archive (SOUSA) 1, the ﬁrst sample from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS1; Ganeshalingam et al. 2010), the second sample from LOSS (LOSS2; Stahl et al. 2019), and the Dark Energy Survey (DES; Brout et al. 2019b). All but DES are low-z surveys, which is why in 1 Light curves from SOUSA can be found at https://pbrown801. github.io/SOUSA/. Figure 1. (Top:) The redshift distribution of the Pan- theon+ sample that passes all the light-curve requirements, as well as the same for the JLA and Pantheon samples. The largest increase in the number of SNe for the Pantheon+ sample is at low redshift owing to the addition of the Foun- dation, LOSS1, LOSS2, SOUSA, and CNIa0.2 samples. The largest increase at higher redshift is due to the inclusion of the DES 3-year sample. We do not use SNe from SNLS at z > 0.8 due to sensitivity to the U -band in model training, so the Pantheon+ statistics between 0.8 < z < 1.0 are lower than that of Pantheon and JLA. (Bottom:) The Pantheon+ redshift diagram shown cumulatively by survey. Figure 1 the largest improvement in SN numbers is at low redshift. Additionally, there was a new data release for the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP; Krisciunas et al. 2017b) which remeasured previous photometry for CSP-I and added more SNe. We note that beyond the main samples included in the data releases described in Table 1, there are ad- ditional light curves here. These include CSP SNe (SNe 2015F, 2013aa, 2012ht, and 2012fr) from CSP-II 4 that were published by Burns et al. (2018) and Burns et al. (2020), SN 2005df from Milne et al. (2010) and Krisciunas et al. (2017a), SN 2006dd from Stritzinger et al. (2010), SN 2007on and SN 2011iv from Gall et al. (2018), SN 2007gi from Zhang et al. (2010), SN 2008fv from Tsvetkov & Elenin (2010), SN 2019ein from Kawa- bata et al. (2020). Additionally, there are light curves that have not yet been published, but are included in the respective Pan- theon+ sample. These are SN 2021pit from SOUSA and SN 2021hpr from LOSS2, which follow the pro- cessing and photometric systems of the larger samples. Additionally, there are three light curves from Founda- tion after their release (SN 2017erp, SN 2018gv, and SN 2019np). SN 2018gv and SN 2019n were processed with the same pipeline described in Foley et al. (2018). For SN 2017erp, this SN was outside of the PS1 foot- print, so Skymapper catalogs (Onken et al. 2019) were used to set the photometric zeropoints following the pro- cess outlined in Scolnic et al. (2015). We have made a special eﬀort to calibrate and in- clude surveys that contain observations of SNe Ia in near enough galaxies (≲ 40 Mpc) for which Cepheid ob- servations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have been obtained because such objects are rare (approxi- mately one per year) and their numbers limit the pre- cision of the determination of H0 (see R22). As shown by Brownsberger et al. (2021), the sensitivity of mea- surements of H0 to the photometric calibration of SN light curves depends on whether the relative number of second-rung SNe observed by a survey is similar to the relative number of third-rung SNe observed by that survey. Brownsberger et al. (2021) demonstrate that our current compilation has suﬃciently similar numbers so that the impact of potential cross-survey systematics from calibration is < 0.2% in H0. For each of the samples, the photometric systems are recalibrated by B22a. Two surveys previously in Pan- theon have changed in response to an improved under- standing of their photometry. (1) For SDSS, the re- ported photometry was thought in Pantheon to be in the AB system but was actually in the natural system, so oﬀsets to the photometry of [−0.06, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01 mag] in ugriz were not applied in Pantheon (the u-band usage in SALT2 is minimal, as most SNe discov- ered by SDSS are at z > 0.1, outside the usable redshift range for the u band ﬁlter). (2) For CfA3K and CfA3S, the photometry of the SNe was assumed in Pantheon to be in the natural system but was actually in the stan- dard system — this changes the B band by ∼ +0.01 mag fainter relative to the other bands. We release the light curves with the photometry as given by the original sources here (though all put in a standard syntax): https://pantheonplussh0es.github. io/. The calibration of the samples and derived oﬀsets to the photometric zeropoints given in B22a will be in- cluded at the same github page. Furthermore, we in- clude ﬁles to quickly apply calibration deﬁnitions and oﬀsets (e.g., the CALSPEC zeropoints needed to deﬁne the photometric systems) to ﬁt the light curves. 2.1. Light-Curve Fits In order to obtain distance moduli (µ) from SN Ia light curves, we ﬁt the light curves with the SALT2 model (Guy et al. 2007) using the trained model pa- rameters from B22a over a spectral energy distribu- tion (SED) wavelength range of 200–900 nm. We se- lect passbands whose central wavelength (¯λ) satisﬁes 300 nm < ¯λ/(1 + z) <700 nm, and we select epochs between −15 to +45 rest-frame days with respect to the epoch of peak brightness. We use the SNANA software package (Kessler et al. 2009) to ﬁt the SALT2 model to the data, and we use SNANA’s MINOS computational algorithm to determine the parameters and their uncer- tainties. Each light-curve ﬁt determines the parameters color (c), stretch (x1), and overall amplitude (x0), with mB ≡ −2.5 log10(x0), as well as the time of peak brightness (t0) in the rest-frame B-band wavelength range. To convert the light-curve ﬁt parameters into a distance modulus, we follow the modiﬁed Tripp (1998) relation as given by Brout et al. (2019a): µ = mB + αx1 − βc − M − δµ−bias, (1) where α and β are correlation coeﬃcients, M is the ﬁducial absolute magnitude of a SN Ia for our speciﬁc standardization algorithm, and δµ−bias is the bias cor- rection derived from simulations needed to account for selection eﬀects and other issues in distance recovery. For the nominal analysis of B22b, the canonical “mass- step correction” δµ−host is included in the bias correction δµ−bias following Brout & Scolnic (2021) and Popovic et al. (2021). The α and β used for the nominal ﬁt are 0.148 and 3.112, respectively, and the full set of distance modulus values and uncertainties are presented by B22b. In addition, we compute a light-curve ﬁt probability (Pﬁt), which is the probability of ﬁnding a light-curve data-model χ2 as large or larger assuming Gaussian- distributed ﬂux uncertainties. In Figure 2, the light curves of the 42 SNe Ia used for the determination of H0 in the second-rung distance ladder of R22 are shown with overlaid light-curve ﬁts using the SALT2 model. All light-curve ﬁt parameters for the sample will be 5 Table 1. Characteristics of Datasets and List of Improvements Source Abbrev.

We provide ﬁtted light-curve parameters for all the light curves with a converged SALT2 ﬁt as part of the data release, but the cosmological analysis is done only with the SNe that pass all the cuts listed in Table 2. made available in machine-readable format as described in Appendix B and shown in Fig. 7. The parameters from the ﬁts of the light curves are given before the set of light curves before the majority of the selection cuts in Table 2 are applied, which are discussed in the following section. Finally, in the discussion about the results on siblings and duplicates below, we refer to the distance-covariance matrix. For this, we follow Conley et al. (2010), which deﬁnes a covariance matrix C with Czizj = ∑ k ∂∆µzi ∂k ∂∆µzj ∂k σ2 k, (2) where the summation is over the systematics (k), ∆µzi are the residuals in distance for the SNe ﬁtted between diﬀerent systematics, and σk is the gives the magnitude 6 Figure 2. Light curves of all SNe Ia used for the SN Ia–Cepheid calibration (second rung of the distance ladder). When a SN has been observed by multiple surveys, multiple light curves are shown for each ﬁlter. The SALT2 ﬁt from each light curve is overplotted. Certain ﬁlters (e.g., I and sometimes R) are not included in the ﬁt when the observed-frame ﬁlter is outside the used SALT2 wavelength range of 300–700 nm. 7 of the systematic uncertainty. Any additional covariance between the ith and jth SNe that is not due to system- atics can be included in that element of the covariance matrix. 2.2. Selection Requirements For this compilation, we require all SNe Ia to have ad- equate light-curve coverage in order to reliably constrain light-curve-ﬁt parameters. We also limit ourselves to in- clude SNe Ia with properties in a range well represented by the training sample in order to limit systematic bi- ases in the measured distance modulus. The sequential loss of SNe Ia from the sample owing to cuts is shown in Table 2. We deﬁne Trest as the number of days since the date of peak brightness t0 in the rest frame of the SN. Following Scolnic et al. (2018), we require an observation before 5 days after peak brightness (Trest < 5). As with Betoule et al. (2014), we also require the uncertainty in the ﬁtted peak-date of the light-curve (PKMJD) to be < 2 observed frame days to ensure precision in the ﬁt. We require −3 < x1 < 3 and −0.3 < c < 0.3 over which the light-curve model has been trained. Furthermore, we require that the uncertainty in x1 is < 1.5 to help avoid pathological ﬁts or inversion issues for systematic uncertainty covariance matrices. For all samples (though only applicable at low z) we require limited Milky Way extinction following Betoule et al. (2014) and Scolnic et al. (2015), E(B − V )MW < 0.2. We follow past analyses of speciﬁc samples in order to employ a minimum Pﬁt cut: this is done for DES, PS1, and SDSS with levels of 0.01, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively. These diﬀerent levels are determined from comparisons of distributions of Pﬁt from data and simu- lations, and depend on the accuracy of the SALT2 model and of the precision of the photometric errors given for SN light-curve measurements. SNLS is the only large, high-z sample in which a Pﬁt cut is not applied, and this is because Betoule et al. (2014) found no diﬀerence in the accuracy of the ﬁtted light curves with low Pﬁt. We see similar insigniﬁcant diﬀerences in Hubble residuals or ﬁt parameters between SNe with high and low Pﬁt as Betoule et al. (2014) do, but retain the usage of Pﬁt to be consistent with how SNLS was previously used. Fi- nally, we remove all SNLS and DES SNe from the sample for z > 0.8, as B22a ﬁnd large (∼ 0.2) diﬀerences in µ for these SNe depending on the inclusion of the U band at low redshift in the SALT2 training samples, and we are unable to calibrate U through cross-calibration. In total, 59 SNe are removed owing to this cut. In the penultimate row of Table 2 (“Valid BiasCor”), 10 light curves are lost owing to their light-curve prop- erties falling within a region of parameter space that is Table 2.

Both the number removed from each cut, and the number remaining after each cut, are shown. The “SALT2 converged” criterion is the starting point for this assessment and includes all light curves for which the ﬁtting procedure converged. Of the 1701 light curves that pass all cuts, 151 are “Duplicate” SNe. too sparsely populated in the simulation to yield a mean- ingful bias prediction. Bias corrections are discussed in detail by B22b. Additionally, there are 60 more light curves that are lost owing to the requirement that they pass all the cuts discussed above for the 40 systematic perturbations discussed by B22b in order to create the covariance matrix in Equation 2. For example, vary- ing the SALT2 model will change the recovered c or x1 values, which could then be outside the allowed ranges. Additionally, B22b place a cut on SN distance modulus values in the Hubble diagram due to Chauvenet’s crite- rion. We label the number cut here in Table 2, and this is discussed in detail by B22b. In total, 1701 light curves pass all the cuts, though as discussed below, a signiﬁcant fraction of these are duplicate SNe. 2.3. Host-galaxy Properties In order to allow the use of host-galaxy information that may improve light-curve standardization (e.g., Sul- livan et al. 2010; Kelly et al. 2010; Lampeitl et al. 2010; Popovic et al. 2021), we rederived host properties for all SNe Ia with z < 0.15 so that they can be measured con- sistently. For z > 0.15 and higher-z surveys, we use the masses provided from respective analyses: for SNLS Be- toule et al. (2014), for SDSS Sako et al. (2018), for PS1 Scolnic et al. (2018), and for DES Smith et al. (2020). We discuss consistency across these diﬀerent samples be- low. For the HST surveys as listed in Table 1, masses 8 were not originally derived for the majority of the host galaxies, so we followed a similar procedure as below but using photometry directly from the publicly available images acquired as part of the surveys given in Table 1. There are three steps we follow to determine the masses of the host galaxies: 1. Identify the host galaxy. 2. Measure photometry of the host galaxy. 3. Fit a galaxy SED model to the data. For the low-z sample, for host-galaxy identiﬁcation, we followed the work of C22 to identify host galaxies and used the directional-light-radius method described by Sullivan et al. (2006) and Gupta et al. (2016) to associate a host galaxy with each SN Ia. All host-galaxy identiﬁ- cations were visually inspected for quality control. We then retrieved images from GALEX (Martin et al. 2005), PS1 (Chambers & et al. 2017), SDSS (Ahumada et al. 2020), and 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006). We measure aperture photometry on the images, and use the PS1 r band to measure the size of the host galaxy “ellipse.” We then use that ellipse size to measure consistent ellip- tical aperture photometry for every image of the source. We use ugriz SDSS photometry rather than griz PS1 photometry when both are available as PS1 has some background-subtraction defects for bright hosts (Jones et al. 2019). In order to determine host-galaxy properties from the photometry of the galaxies, we used the LePHARE SED-ﬁtting method (Ilbert et al. 2006). The galaxy tem- plates use the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function and were taken from the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) library. The values of the extinction E(B − V ) varied from 0 to 0.4 mag. For galaxies that LePHARE was not able to determine a host mass, we ﬁrst conﬁrm that the hosts are faint and have not been misidentiﬁed, and then we assign them to the low-mass bin. A plot of the trend of host-galaxy masses for our largest samples (CSP, Foundation, CfA3, DES, SDSS, SNLS, PS1) is shown in Figure 3. When we compare diﬀerent estimates of host-galaxy mass from varying the photometry or mass-ﬁtting technique, we ﬁnd typical diﬀerences on the level of 0.2 dex (see, e.g., Sako et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2020), which would make up some of the diﬀerences between median mass of diﬀerent sam- ples. Another way to quantify this is to measure the diﬀerence in the relative ratio of high-mass to low-mass hosts (where the separator is 1010 M⊙) between diﬀer- ent surveys. Doing so, we ﬁnd that typical diﬀerences in the same bin between surveys on the order of 15% would cause ∼ 0.01 mag biases for a mass step of 0.06 mag if they were systematic and not random. As there is no evidence of systematic biases beyond the 0.2 dex scale, this number is used to account for systematics in B22b. Furthermore, we ﬁnd relatively good agreement with past estimates compiled in Pantheon, with the typ- ical diﬀerences between median masses in the same bin on the level of 0.5 dex. Figure 3. The median host-galaxy mass per redshift bin for the 7 samples with the highest statistics. 2.4. Trends of SN Parameters and Comparison to Previous Analyses We show the evolution of the light-curve ﬁt param- eters with redshift in Figure 4. As seen in previous analyses, we do ﬁnd nonzero evolution of these parame- ters with redshift. These are modeled by Popovic et al. (2021), who describe a separate mass distribution for low-z (e.g., CfA1–4, CSP) and high-z (SDSS, SNLS, PS1, DES) samples. In total, there are 1701 SNe, signiﬁcantly more than the number from Pantheon (1048) or JLA (742). All but 14 of the SNe in Pantheon are in Pantheon+, and all but 10 of the SNe in JLA are in Pantheon+. In B22a, we show the diﬀerences between the µ values found in Pantheon+ and those found in Pantheon and JLA. The largest diﬀerences are due to the calibration of the SALT2 model, which is revised by B22a. We note that the issue of revising the CfA3K and CfA3S system def- inition mentioned previously does cause a ∼ 0.025 mag change (toward fainter distance-modulus values) relative to Pantheon. 3.

The uncertainties in µ do not include contributions from peculiar velocities or intrinsic scatter. Additionally, the sample source of the SN is given in the last column, and we include measurements of the same SN from multiple samples where available. 3.1. Sibling Supernovae As part of this analysis and that of C22, we have de- termined the host galaxy for each SN in our sample. We can then query for galaxies that have hosted more than one SN that make it to the Hubble diagram. Note that owing to our strict quality cuts, this number is fewer than the total number of SN siblings. We ﬁnd 12 galax- ies that have hosted SN siblings, as listed in Table 3. We include the measurements from diﬀerent samples if a SN has been observed by multiple telescopes. Two of the galaxies hosted three SNe, and we consider all pair-wise combinations of the triplets. Comparing the properties of the SNe, we ﬁnd the stan- dard deviation of the diﬀerences in c of 0.10, in x1 of 1.04, and in µ of 0.32 mag. We can compare these values to those taking random pairs of SNe at low z by boot- strapping: c of 0.12, x1 of 1.6, and ∆µ of 0.22, where ∆µ subtracts oﬀ the best-ﬁt cosmology to account for two SNe having two diﬀerent redshifts. A median 0.22 mag diﬀerence is consistent with expectations for SNe with a dispersion of ∼ 0.16 mag, which is the RMS on the Hubble diagram found in B22b. We ﬁnd that the un- certainties in the standard deviation are 0.023 in c, 0.33 in x1, and 0.043 in ∆µ. Therefore, we ﬁnd that the x1 values for the siblings are ∼ 2σ closer than two random 10 Figure 4. The evolution of ﬁtted SALT2 x1 and c parame- ters, as well as the host-galaxy mass with redshift. SNe are shown here if they pass the light-curve selection requirements discussed in Sec. 2.2. The error bars shown here are given as the root-mean square of values in that redshift bin. SNe, the c values are < 1σ closer, but the µ values are 2.4σ further apart in the siblings than any random pair of SNe. The relatively high agreement in x1 but low agreement in ∆µ is consistent with the ﬁndings of Scol- nic et al. (2020) for 8 pairs of siblings found in the DES sample: there are indications that x1 is correlated for SNe in the same hosts, but no signiﬁcant evidence that the ∆µ values are correlated. This insight is important for creating the systematic covariance matrix of B22b that no covariance should be given for measurements of SN distances in the same galaxy. 3.2. Duplicate Supernovae We denote SNe that have been observed by multiple surveys as “Duplicate SNe.” As discussed by R22 and B22b, unlike in previous analyses, we do not choose be- tween speciﬁc versions of the SNe and instead propagate each ﬁt from each survey, and then include a covariance term between the duplicate SNe in our ﬁnal covariance matrix used for cosmology. Not all duplicate SNe have the same given name, and we therefore search on RA, DEC, and PKMJD for duplicate SNe. In total, there are 151 SNe which have been observed by more than one survey, with all but one duplicate SN having z < 0.1. We ﬁnd a standard deviation of the diﬀerences in the pairs of 0.102 mag. Following a similar bootstrapping procedure as above, and only using low-z SNe, we cal- culate a typical dispersion for 151 pairs of random SNe (correcting for redshift diﬀerences) to have 0.218 mag Figure 5. A comparison of the duplicate SNe. Here we show the mean diﬀerence in distance modulus of duplicate SNe in a given survey and all the other SNe with duplicate SNe observed. The number of duplicates is labeled in the plot. No oﬀset is beyond 2σ. with 0.011 uncertainty. Therefore, the distances of the same SN measured by two separate surveys agree by > 10σ better than two random SNe. This insight is again important for creating the systematic covariance matrix in B22b that the intrinsic scatter of a SN Ia should be shared for measurements of the same SN by diﬀerent surveys; from Equation 2, Czi,zi = σint, where the i-th and j-th light curve are of the same SN from diﬀerent samples, and σint is the intrinsic scatter of the sample. In Figure 5, we present a comparison of the distance modulus of the SN duplicates between surveys. We do not ﬁnd any deviations from the mean beyond 2σ. The largest deviation is from LOSS1 (Ganeshalingam et al. 2010) at 2.0σ. B22a show the mean distance modulus residuals for each subsample for all surveys and do not ﬁnd any magnitude deviations greater than 0.05 mag with the exception of CfA1. Our results here generally support the agreement found by B22a. Furthermore, in Table 4, we give the fraction of the sample each survey contributes to the 2nd and 3rd rungs of the distance ladder described in R22, where the 3rd rung has the limit of z < 0.15 and those in the 2nd rung are determined SNe found in nearby galaxies with associated Cepheid measurements. (We note that the baseline determination of H0 further limits the 3rd rung sample to z > 0.0233 and to late-type hosts.) Assuming (gray) survey errors, an estimate of the error in H0 from survey miscalibration results from the diﬀerence in these fractions multiplied by the mean residual of each survey 11 from the full compilation. We give the fractional diﬀer- ence between these two rungs by sample and the survey residual calculated by B22a (see Figure 6) in Table 4. If one multiplies the fractional diﬀerence between rungs by the Hubble residual oﬀsets, this describes the sensitivity of H0 (in magnitudes, not km/s/Mpc) to possible dis- crepancies of sample oﬀsets. We ﬁnd that the largest fractional diﬀerence is due to Foundation at ∼ 23%, and the majority of the fractional diﬀerences are be- tween 2 − 15%. After multiplying these diﬀerences by the Hubble residual oﬀsets, we ﬁnd the products are all below 4 mmag. This would imply a sensitivity in H0 on the level of 0.2%. This also illustrates the beneﬁt of us- ing a similar mix of surveys for both samples. Because we cannot avoid using a mix of surveys for the 2nd rung (these are objects are rare) the use of a single sample for the 3rd rung would propagate an error in H0 at the level of ∼ 1% as shown in Brownsberger et al. (2021). 4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented the new “Pantheon+” sample that is used in a series of analyses for cosmo- logical parameter measurements. The challenge of a compilation analysis like this one is documentation, and unlike previous analyses, we attempt here to document key properties about the samples (photometric system, data location, references) to improve reproducibility in the future. The Pantheon+ analysis improves on the Pantheon analysis in nearly every facet. Not only do we increase the sample size, but we do a comprehensive review of the redshifts (C22) and peculiar velocities (Peterson et al. 2021), a new calibration and model retraining for the sample (B22a), and new cosmological analyses by R22 and B22b. In Section 2, we detail data that have been added to the previous Pantheon compilation, as well as changes to the data that were previously used. As these samples date back 40 yr, we have made a signiﬁcant eﬀort to check assumptions about how data have been passed from analysis to analysis, rather than assuming previous analyses have understood each facet correctly. The size of a sample like this will soon be surpassed by other samples from newer and upcoming surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Dhawan et al. 2021), the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE; Jones et al. 2021), the Dark Energy Survey (DES; Smith et al. 2020), the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; Ivezi´c et al. 2019), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman; Hounsell et al. 2018). These surveys may ﬁnd a similar number of SNe to this compilation in only a matter of days. However, the usefulness of the Pantheon+ sample, particularly at low redshift, is unlikely to be surpassed for some time owing to its util- ity for constraining the Hubble constant. For this mea- surement, we are statistically limited by the number of SNe in nearby galaxies in which Cepheids can be found, which is typically one SN discovered per year (R22). Two of the ﬁndings from this paper will be used to create the systematic covariance matrix of B22b. The ﬁrst is that we ﬁnd excellent agreement when diﬀerent surveys measure the same SNe, and the second is that we ﬁnd relatively poor agreement when surveys measure distances of two SNe in the same galaxy. The latter of these ﬁndings will be best tested with LSST, which can ﬁnd over 800 siblings (The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration et al. 2018; Scolnic et al. 2020). Finally, we show that because of our eﬀort to include samples that cover the second and third rung of the distance ladder, the accuracy of the H0 measurement will not be limited by possible discrepancies in measurements of the SN distances by sample.

DATA-RELEASE STRUCTURE The data release will be found at https://pantheonplussh0es.github.io/. It will also be found in the public version of SNANA in the directory “Pantheon+”. The link for the SNANA full data download is https://zenodo.org/record/ 4015325, and the SNANA source directory is https://github.com/RickKessler/SNANA. The structure of the Pantheon+ directory contains 18 subdirectories, with folder names synced to the data samples listed in Table 1. In each folder, there is a .README ﬁle with documentation of the source of the data ﬁles, and a .LIST ﬁle which lists the SNe Ia ﬁtted as part of this analysis. In each subdirectory, there are .txt ﬁles or .FITS describing the SN light curves along with meta-information. If there are .txt ﬁles, the meta-information is at the top of the ﬁle, whereas if there is a .FITS ﬁle, the meta-information is in the HEAD.FITS ﬁle while the light-curve data are in the PHOT.FITS ﬁle. For a single .txt ﬁle for one light curve, we show an example screenshot in Figure 6. The meta-information includes the following: 15 Light-curve ﬁle for SN 2021pit Figure 6. Display of what an SNANA light-curve ﬁle looks like for SN 2021pit. The full ﬁle is included at https: //pantheonplussh0es.github.io/. • SN name • SN position: RA, DEC in degrees and host position. • SN Milky Way extinction (though this is overridden in ﬁtting to ensure consistency with Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011). • The heliocentric redshift, CMB-frame redshift, and peculiar velocity VPEC. The light-curve data has columns for Date (MJD), Filter (FLT), Flux (FLUXCAL), Flux Uncertainty (FLUXCALERR), Magnitude (MAG), and Magnitude Uncertainty (MAGERR). The common zero-point for all ﬂux measurements is 27.5 mag. We also include several global ﬁles for various properties. These include the following: • List of Heliocentric, CMB, and Peculiar Velocities as derived by C22. • List of all host-galaxy properties determined for this analysis. These include mass for all SNe, and SFR and morphology for SNe with z < 0.15. Finally, we include a combined ﬁle of all the ﬁtted parameters for each SN, before and after light-curve cuts are applied. This is in the format of a .FITRES ﬁle and has all the meta-information listed above along with the ﬁtted SALT2 parameters. We show a screenshot of the release in Figure 7. Here, we give brief descriptions of each column. CID – name of SN. CIDint – counter of SNe in the sample. IDSURVEY – ID of the survey. TYPE – whether SN Ia or not – all SNe in this sample are SNe Ia. FIELD – if observed in a particular ﬁeld. CUTFLAG SNANA – any bits in light-curve ﬁt ﬂagged. ERRFLAG FIT – ﬂag in ﬁt. zHEL – heliocentric redshift. zHELERR – heliocentric redshift error. zCMB – CMB redshift. zCMBERR – CMB redshift error. zHD – Hubble Diagram redshift. zHDERR – Hubble Diagram redshift error. VPEC – peculiar velocity. VPECERR – peculiar-velocity error. MWEBV – MW extinction. HOST LOGMASS – mass of host. HOST LOGMASS ERR – error in mass of host. HOST sSFR – sSFR of host. HOST sSFR ERR – error in sSFR of host. PKMJDINI – initial guess for PKMJD. SNRMAX1 – First highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of light curve. SNRMAX2 – Second highest SNR of light curve. SNRMAX3 – Third highest SNR of light curve. PKMJD – Fitted PKMJD. PKMJDERR – 16 Fitted PKMJD error. x1 – Fitted x1. x1ERR – Fitted x1 error. c – Fitted c. cERR – Fitted c error. mB – Fitted mB. mBERR – Fitted mB error. x0 – Fitted x0. x0ERR – Fitted x0 error. COV x1 c – covariance between x1 and c. COV x1 x0 – covariance between x1 and x0. COV c x0 – covariance between c and x0. NDOF – number of degrees of freedom (epochs) in light-curve ﬁt. FITCHI2 – χ2 of light-curve ﬁt. FITPROB – ﬁt probability. RA – RA of SN (deg). DEC – DEC of SN (deg). HOST RA – RA of host (deg). HOST DEC – DEC of host (deg). HOST ANGSEP – Separation between SN and host (deg). TGAPMAX – largest gap (in days) between observations. TrestMIN – minimum epoch with SN observation (day). TrestMAX – maximum epoch with SN observation (day). ELU – morphological classiﬁcation. FITRES ﬁle from SNANA’s SALT2 light-curve ﬁtting Figure 7. Display of what a .FITRES ﬁle looks like that has all the information from the light-curve ﬁt, as well as ancillary information. A value of −9 is given where information is unavailable.
