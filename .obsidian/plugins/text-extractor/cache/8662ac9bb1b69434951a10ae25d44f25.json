It is this growth which the present collection of papers is designed chiefly to exhibit. In the earlier papers there are some things which the authors would no doubt now ex- press differently ; the later papers deal with problems which are not by any means yet fully solved. At the end we must confess that Relativity is still very much of a problem-and therefore worthy of our study. The authors of the papers are still actively at work on the subject-all save Minkowski. His paper on \" Space and Time\" is a measure of the loss which mathematical physics suffered by his untimely death. The translations have been made from the text, as published in a German collection, under the title \"Des Relativitatsprinzip\" (Teubneri 4th ed., 1922). v vi THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY The second paper by Lorentz is an exc~ption to this. It is reprinted from the original English version in the Proceedings of the Amsterdam Academy.

MICHELSON'S INTERFERENCE EXPERIMENT BY H. A. LORENTZ 1. AS Maxwell first remarked and as follows from a very simple calculation, the time required by a ray of light to travel from a point A to a point B and back to A must vary when the two points together undergo a displacement without carrying the ether with them. The difference is, certainly, a magnitude of second order ; but it is sufficiently great to be detected by a sensitive interference method. The experiment was carried out by Michelson in 1881. * His apparatus, a kind of interferometer, had two horizontal arms, P and Q, of equal length and at right angles one to the other. Of the two mutually interfering rays of light the one passed along the arm P and back, the other along the arm Q and back. The whole instrument, including the source of light and the arrangement for taking observations, couln be revolved about a vertical axis; and those two positions come especially under consideration in which the arm P or the arm Q lay as nearly as possible in the direction of the Earth's motion. On the basis of Fresnel's theory it was anticipated that when the apparatus was revolved from one of these principal positions into the other there would be a displacement of the interference fringes. But of such a displacement-for the sake of brevity we will call it the Maxwell displacement-conditioned by the change in the times of propagation, no trace was discovered, and accordingly Michelson thought himself justified in con- cluding that while the Earth is moving, the ether does not remain at rest. The correctness of this inference was soon brought into question, for by an oversight Michelson had * Michelson, American Journal of Science, 22, 1881, p. 120. 3 4 MICHELSON'S EXPERIMENT ta.ken the cha.nge in the pha.se difference, which wa.s to be expected in accordance with the theory, a.t twice its proper va.lue. If we ma.ke the necessary correction, we a.rrive a.t displacements no greater than might be ma.sked by errors of observation. Subsequently Michelson* took up the investigation a.new in collaboration with Morley, enhancing the delicacy of the experiment by ca.using ea.ch pencil to be reflected to and fro between a. number of mirrors, thereby obtaining the same advantage a.s if the arms of the earlier apparatus had been considerably lengthened. The mirrors were mounted on a massive stone disc, floating on mercury, a.nd therefore easily revolved. Each pencil now had to travel a total distance of 22 meters, and on Fresnel's theory the displacement to be expected in passing from the one principal position to the other would be 0·4 of the distance between the interference fringes. Nevertheless the rotation produced displacements not exceeding O 02 of this distance, and these might well be a.scribed to errors of observation. Now, does this result entitle us to a.ssume that the ether takes pa.rt in the motion of the Earth, a.nd therefore that the theory of aberration given by Stokes is the correct one? The difficulties which this theory encounters in explaining aberration seem too great for me to share this opinion, and I would ra.ther try to remove the contra.diction between Fresnel's theory and Michelson's result. An hypothesis which I brought forward some time a.go,t and which, a.s I subsequently learned, has also occurred to Fitzgerald,! enables us to do this. The next pa.re.graph will set out this hypo- thesis. 2. To simplify matters we will assume that we a.re work- ing with a.ppa.ra.tus as employed in the first experiments, and that in•the one principal position the a.rm P lies exactly in • Michelson and Morley, American Journal of Science, 84, 1887, p. SSS; Phil. Mag., 24, 1887, p. 449. t Lorentz, Zittingsversl.a.gen der Akad. v. Wet. te Amsterdam, 1892-98, p. 74.. t AB Fitzgerald kindly tells me, he has for a long time dealt with hie hypothesis in his lectures. The only published reference which I ca.n find to the hypothesis is by Ledge, \" Aberration Problems,\" Phil. Trans. R.S,, 184 A, 1898. ff.A.LORENTZ 5 the direction of the motion of the Earth. Let v be the velocity of this motion, L the length of either arm, and hence 2L the path traversed by the rays of light. According to the theory,• the turning of the apparatus through 90° causes the time in which the one pencil travels along P and back to be longer than the time which the other pencil takes to complete its journey by There would be this same difference if the transla. tion had no influence and the arm P were longer than the arm Q by tLv 2/c2. Similarly with the second principal position. Thus we see that the phase differences expected by the theory might a.lso arise if, when the apparatus is revolved, first the one arm and then the other arm were the longer. It follows that the phase differences ca.n be compensated by contrary changes of the dimensions. If we assume the arm which lies in the direction of the Earth's motion to be shorter than the other by tLv 2/c2, and, at the sa.me time, that the translation has the influence which Fresnel's theory allows it, then the result of the Michelson experiment is explained completely. Thus one would have to imagine that the motion of a solid body (such as a brass rod or the stone di!!C employed in the later experiments) through the resting ether exerts upon the dimensions of that body an influence which varies accord- ing to the orientation of the body with respect to the direction of motion. If, for example, the dimensions parallel to this direction were changed in the proportion of I to I + o, and those p.erpendicular in the proportion of I to 1 + e, then we should have the equation . (I) in which the value of one of the quantities o and e would remain undetermined. It might be that e = 0, o = - tv 2/c2, but also e = tv2/c2, o = 0, ore= t;v2/c2, and o = - t;v2/c2• 3. Surprising as this hypothesis may appear at first sight, * Cf. Lorentz, Arch. N,er1,, 2, 1887, pp. 168-176. 6 MICHELSON'S EXPERIMENT yet we shall have to admit that it is by no means far-fetched, as soon as we assume that molecular forces are also trans- mitted through the ether, like the electric and magnetic forces of which we a.re able at the present time to make this as- sertion definitely. If they are so transmitted, the translation will very probably affect the action between two molecules or atoms in a manner resembling the attraction or repulsion be- tween charged particles. Now, since the form and dimensions of a solid body are ultimately conditioned by the intensity of molecular actions, there cannot fail to be a. change of di- mensions as well From the theoretical side, therefore, there would be no objection to the hypothesis. As regards its experimental proof, we must first of all note that the lengthenings and shortenings in question are extraordinarily small. We have v2/c2 = I0- 8, and thus, if e = 0, the shortening of the one diameter of the Earth would amount to about 6·5 cm. The length of a meter rod would change, when moved from one principal position into the other, by about rilf micron. One could hardly hope for success in trying to perceive such small quantities except by means of an interference method. We should have to operate with two perpendicular rods, and with two mutually interfering pencils of light, allowing the one to travel to and fro along the first rod, and the other along the second rod. But in this way we should come back once more to the Michelson experiment, and revolving the apparatus we should perceive no displacement of the fringes. Reversing a. previous remark, we might now say that the dis- placement produced by the a.Iterations of length is com- pensated by the Maxwell displacement. 4. It is worth noticing that we a.re led to just the same changes of dimensions as have been presumed above if we, firstly, without taking molecular movement into consider- ation, assume that in a solid body left to itself the forces, at- tractions or repulsions, acting upon any molecule maintain one another in equilibrium, and, secondly-though to be sure, there is no reason for doing so-if we apply to these molecular forces the law which in another place* we deduced for • Viz., § 23 of the book, \"Versuch einer Theorie der elektrischen und opti· schen Erscheinungen in bewegtQn Korpern.\" H.A.LORENTZ 7 electrostatic actions. For if we now understand by 81 and 82 not, as formerly, two systems of charged particles, but two systems of molecules-the second at rest and the first moving with a velocity v in the direction of the axis of z-between the dimensions of which the relationship subsists as previously stated ; and if we assume that in both systems the z com- ponents of the forces are the ea.me, while the y and z com- ponents differ from one another by the factor .,/1 - v~/c\\ then it is clear that the forces in 81 will be in equilibrium when- ever they a.re so in 82• If therefore 82 is the state of equilibrium of a solid body at rest, then the molecules in 81 have precisely those positions in which they can persist under the influence of translation. The displacement would na.tura.lly bring about this disposition of the molecules of its own accord, a.nd thus effect a shortening in the direction of motion in the proportion of 1 to .,/1 - v2/c2, in accordance with the formulm given in the above-mentioned pa.re.graph. This leads to the values .,,z S=-.1.- e-0 ~c2• in agreement with (1). In reality the molecules of a body a.re not a.t rest, but in every \" state of equilibrium\" there is a. stationary movement. What influence this circumstance may have in the phe- nomenon which we have been considering is a question which we do not here touch upon ; in any case the experiments of Michelson and Morley, in consequence of unavoidable errors of observation, afford considerable latitude for the values of Sande. ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA IN A SYSTEM MOVING WITH ANY VELO- CITY LESS THAN THAT OF LIGHT BY H.A.LORENTZ Reprinted from the English version in Proceedings o/ the Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam, 6, 1904. ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA IN A SYSTEM MOVING WITH ANY VELOCITY LESS THAN THAT OF LIGHT BY H. A. LORENTZ § 1. THE problem of determining the influence exerted on electric a.nd optica.l phenomena. by a. tra.nslation, such as a.11 systems have in virtue of the Earth's annual motion, a.dmits of a. comparatively simple solution, so long as only those terms need be taken into account, which a.re proportional to the first power of the ra.tio between the velocity of translation v and the velocity of light c. Ca.sea in which qua.ntities of the second order, i.e. of the order v2/c2, ma.y be perceptible, present more difficulties. The first ex- a.µiple of this kind is Michelson's well-known interference- experiment, the negative result of which ha.a led Fitzgerald and myself to the conclusion tha.t the dimensions of solid bodies are slightly altered by their motion through the ether. Some new experiments, in which a. second order effect was sought for, have recently been published. Rayleigh• and Brace t have examined the question whether the Earth's motion may cause a body to become doubly refracting. At first sight this might be expected, if the just mentioned change of dimensions is admitted. Both physicists, how- ever, have obtained a negative result. In the second place Trouton and Noblet have endeavoured to detect a. turning couple a.cting on a charged condenser, the plates of which make a certain angle with the direction of translation. The theory of electrons, unless it be modified by some new hypothesis, would undoubtedly require the * Rayleigh, Phil. Ma.g. (6), 4, 1902, p. 678. t Brace, Phil. Mag.

In order to see this, it will suffice to consider a. condenser with ether as dielectric. It may be shown that in every electrostatic system, moving with a. velocity v,• there is a certain amount of \"electromagnetic momentum.\" If we represent this, in direction and magni- tude, by a vector 0, the couple in question will be determined by the vector product t (0. v] . (1) Now, if the a.xis of z is chosen perpendicular to the con- denser plates, the velocity v having any direction we like; a.nd if U is the energy of the condenser, calculated in the ordinary way, the components of O a.re given t by the follow- ing formulre, which a.re exact up to the first order, 2U G,z: = ~Vz, c 2U Gy = \"\"\":! Vy, c G. = 0. Substituting these values in (1), we get for the compon- ents of the couple, up to terms of the second order, 2U 2U c2 VyVz, - <f'\" V,i,Vz, 0. These expressions show tha.t the axis of the couple lies in the plane of the plates, perpendicular to the translation. If a is the angle between the velocity a.nd the normal to the plates, the moment of the couple will be U(v/c)2 sin 2a; it tends to turn the condenser into such a position that the plates are parallel to the Earth's motion. In the apparatus of Trouton and Noble the condenser was fixed to the beam of a. torsion-balance, sufficiently delicate to be deflected by a couple of the above order of magnitude. No effect could however be observed. § 2. The experiments of which I have spoken a.re not the only reason for which a new examination of the problems connected with the motion of the Earth is desirable. Poin- * A vector will be denoted by a Ola.rendon letter, its magnitude by the cor- responding Latin letter. t See my article: \"Weiterbildung der Maxwell'schen Theorie.

Surely this course of inventing -special hypotheses for ea.ch new experi- mental result is somewhat artificial. It would be more satisfactory if it were possible to show by means of certain fundamental assumptions and without neglecting terms of one order of magnitude or another, that many ele9tromagnetic actions a.re entirely independent of the motion of the system. Some yea.rs a.go, I already sought to frame a. theory of this kind. t I believe it is now possible to treat the subject with a better result. The only restriction a.s regards the velocity will be that it be less than that of light. § 3. I shall start from the fundamental equations of the theory of electrons.t Let D be the dielectric displacement in the ether, H the magnetic force, p the volume-density of the charge of an electron, v the velocity of a point of such a, particle, and F the ponderomotive force, i.e. the force, reckoned per unit charge, which is exerted by the ether on a. volume-element of an electron.

The equations (9) lead to the conclusion that the vectors D' and H' may be represented by means of a. scalar potential cf>' and a. vector potential A'.

In order to obtain the solution of (11) and (12) in a simple form, we may take x', y', z' a.a the co-ordinates of a. point P' in a space S', and a.scribe to this point, for ea.ch value of t', the values of p', u', cf>', A', belonging to the corre- sponding point P (x, y, z) of the electromagnetic system.

It will suffice for our purpose to consider two special cases. The first is that of an electrostatic system, i.e. a system having no other motion but the translation with the velocity v. In this case u' = 0, and therefore, by (12), A' = 0. Also, </>' is independent of t', so that the equations (11), (13), and (14) reduce to r1•2,1..• ' l v 't' = - P• D' = - grad' cp', H' = 0 . (19) After having determined the vector D' by means of these equations, we know also the ponderomotive force acting on electrons that belong to the system. For these the formul!B (10) become, since u' = 0, . (20) ... 18 ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA The result may be put in a simple form if we compare the moving system $, with which we are concerned, to another electrostatic system $' which remains at rest, and into which I is changed if the dimensions parallel to the axis of x are multiplied by f)l, and the dimensions which have the direction of y or that of z, by l-a. deformation for which (fJl, l, l) is an appropriate symbol. In this new system, which we may suppose to be placed in the above-mentioned space S', we shall give to the density the value p', determined by (7), so that the charges of corresponding elements of volume and of corresponding electrons are the same in I a.nd I'. Then we shall obtain the forces acting on the electrons of the moving system I, if we first determine the corresponding forces in I', and next multiply their components in the direction of the a.xis of x by l2, and their components perpendicular to z2 that axis by ff This is conveniently expressed by the formula. ( z2 z2) F(I) = l2, ~· fJ F(I') . . (21) It is further to be remarked that, after having found D' by (19), we can easily calculate the electromagnetic momentum in the moving system, or rather its component in the direction of the motion. Indeed, the formula 0 = Uco. H]dS shows that Gx = ~J(DyH,; - DzHy)dS. Therefore, by (6), since H' = 0 Gx = .e:~ 4vJ(Dy12 + Dz'2)dS = ~~vJ(Dy'2 + D,?)dS'. (22) § 7. Our second special case is that of a particle having an electric moment, i.e. a small space S, with a total charge J pdS = 0, but with such a. distribution of density that the H.A. LORENTZ 19 integrals J pxdS, J pydS, J pzdS have values differing from 0. Let E, µ,, t be the co-ordinates, taken relatively to a fixed point A of the particle, which may be called its centre, and let the electric moment be defined as a vector P whose com- ponents are Pw = JpfdS, P:v = Jp11dS, Pz = JptdS . . (23) Then Of course, if E, 11, t are treated as infinitely small, Ux, u,, u~ must be so likewise. We shall neglect squares and products of these six quantities. We shall now apply the equation (17) to the determination of the scalar potential cf,' for an exterior point P (x, y, z), at a finite distance from the polarized particle, and for the instant at which the local time of this point has some definite value t'. In doing so, we shall give the symbol [p], which, in (17), relates to the instant at which the local time in dS is t' - r'/e, a slightly different meaning. Distinguishing by r' 0 the value of r' for the centre A, we shall understand by [p] the value of the density existing in the element dS at the point (E, 11, ~. at the instant t0 at which the local time of A is t' - r0/e. It may be seen from (5) that this instant precedes that for which we have to take the numerator in (17) by f12vf + fJ(r'0 - r') = f12\":!f + fi(E?ir' + ?Jr' + t\"r') e2 le e2 le ?ix 11ay ?iz units of time.

We may further use the equations (20), instead of the original formulie (10), if we wish to consider the forces exerted by the polarized particle on a similar one placed at some distance. Indeed, in the second particle, as well as in the first, the velocities u may be held to be infinitely small. It is to be remarked that the formulie for a system without translation are implied in what precedes. For such a system the quantities with accents become identical to the corresponding ones without accents ; also fJ = 1 and l = 1. The components of (27) are at the same time those of the electric force which is exerted by one polarized particle on another. § 8. Thus far we have used only the fundamental equations without any new assumptions. I shall now suppose that the electrons, which I take to be spheres of radius R in the state of rest, have their dimensions changed by the effect of a translation, the dimensions in, the direction of motion becoming fJl times and those in perpendicular directions l times smaller. In this deformation, which may be represented by (jl' i, f), each element of volume is understood to p_.eserve its charge. Our assumption amounts to saying that in an electro- static system I, moving with a velocity v, all electrons are flattened ellipsoids with their smaller axes in the direction of 22 ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA motion. If now, in order to apply the theorem of § 6, we subject the system to the deformation (fJl, l, l), we shall have again spherical electrons of radius R. Hence, if we alter the relative position of the centres of the electrons in I by applying the deformation (f]l, l, l), and if, in the points thus obtained, we place the centres of electrons that remain at rest, we shall get a system, identical to the imaginary system I', of which we have spoken in § 6. The forces in this system and those in I wlll bear to each other the rela- tion expressed by (21). In the second place I shall suppose that the forces be- tween uncharged particles, as well as those between such particles and electrons, are influenced by a translation in quite the same way as the electric forces in an electrostatic system. In other terms, whatever be the nature of the particles composing a ponderable body, so long as they do not move relatively to each other, we shall have between the forces acting in a system (I') without, and the same system (I) with a translation, the relation specified in (21), if, as re- gards the relative position of the particles, I' is got from I by the deformation (fJl, l, l), or I from I' by the deformation ( 1 1 1) f]l' l' l . We see by this that, as soon as the resulting force is zero for a particle in I', the aa.me must be true for the correspond- ing particle in I. Consequently, if, neglecting the effects of molecular motion, we suppose each particle of a solid body to be in equilibrium under the action of the attractions and repulsions exerted by its neighbours, and if we take for granted that there is but one configuration of equilibrium, we may draw the conclusion that the system I', if the velocity v is imparted to it, will of itself change into the system I. In other terms, the translation will produce the deformation ( 1 1 1) \"l{l' r· r · The case of molecular motion will be considered in § 12. It will easily be seen that the hypothesis which was formerly advanced in connexion with Michelson's experi- ment, is implied in what has now been said. However, the present hypothesis is more genera.I, because the only H. A. LORENTZ 23 limitation imposed on the motion is tba.t its velocity be less than tha.t of light. § 9. We a.re now in a. position to calculate the electro- magnetic momentum of a. single electron. For simplicity's sake I shall suppose the charge e to be uniformly distributed over the surface, so long as the electron remains a.t rest. Then a. distribution of the same kind will exist in the system I' with which we are concerned in the la.st integral of (22). Hence a.nd co J(D'2 + D'2z)dS' = ~JD'2dS' = !:..j·dr = ~ , y 3 67T r 2 67T R R e2 Gx = 6'1Tc~RfJlv. It must be observed that the product fJl is a function of v and that, for reasons of symmetry, the vector O has the direction of the translation. In genera.I, representing by v the velocity ol this motion, we ha.ve the vector equation e2 0 = 6'1Tc2RfJlv (28) Now, every change in the motion of a. system will entail a corresponding change in the electromagnetic momentum a.nd will therefore require a. certain force, which is given in direction and magnitude by F = dO dt . (29) Strictly speaking, the formula (28) ma.y only be applied in the case of a. uniform rectilinear translation. On account of this circumstance-though (29) is always true-the theory of rapidly varying motions of an electron becomes very com- plicated, the more so, because the hypothesis of § 8 would imply that the direction and amount of the deformation are continually changing. It is, indeed, hardly probable that the form of the electron will be determined solely by the velocity existing at the moment considered. Nevertheless, provided the changes in the state of motion 24 ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA be sufficiently slow, we shall get a satisfactory approximation by using (28) a.t every instant. The application of (29) to such a quasi-stationary translation, as it has been ca.lled by Abraham,* is a very simple matter. Let, at a certain instant, 8 1 be the acceleration in the direction of the path, and 8 2 the acceleration perpendicular to it. Then the force F will con- sist of two components, having the directions of these acce- lerations and which are given by F1 = mi81 and F2 = m282, if e2 d(fJlv) e2 m1 = 671'c2R -a;;- and ~ = 671'c2RfJl . . (30) Hence, in phenomena in which there is an acceleration in the direction of motion, the electron behaves as if it had a mass m1 ; in those in which the acceleration is normal to the path, as if the mass were m2• These quantities mi and m2 may therefore properly be called the \" longitudinal \" and \" transverse \" electromagnetic masses of the electron. I shall suppose that there is no other, no \" true \" or \" material \" mass. Since fJ and l differ from unity by quantities of the order v2/c2, we find for very small velocities e2 m1 = ~ - 671'c2R. This is the mass with which we are concerned, if there are small vibratory motions of the electrons in a. system without translation. If, on the contrary, motions of this kind are going on in a body moving with the velocity v in the direction of the axis of z, we shall have to reckon with the mass mi, as given by (30), if we consider the vibrations parallel to that axis, and with the mass m2, if we treat of those that a.re para.Bel to OY or OZ. Therefore, in short terms, referring by the index i to a moving system and by i 1 to one that remains at rest, m(};) =- ( d(:;v), fJl, fJl )mC};') . (31) • A bra.ham, Wied. Ann., 10, 1908, p. 105. :(I. A. LORENTZ 25 § 10. We can now proceed to examine the influence of the Earth's motion on optical phenomena in a system of trans- parent bodies. In discussing this problem we shall fix our attention on the variable electric moments in the particles or \" atoms \" of the system. To these moments we may apply what ha.s been said in § 7. For the sake of simplicity we shall suppose that, in each particle, the charge is concentrated in a certain number of separate electrons, and that the \" elastic \" forces that act on one of these, and, conjointly with the electric forces, determine its motion, have their origin within the bounds of the same atom. I shall show that, if we start from any given state of motion in a system without translation, we may deduce from it a corresponding state that can exist in the same system after a· translation has been imparted to it, the kind of corre- spondence being as specified in what follows. (a) Let A'i, A'2 , A'3 , etc., be the centres of the particles in the system without translation (~') ; neglecting molecular motions we shall assume these points to remain at rest. The system of points Ai, A2, A3, etc., formed by the centres of the particles in the moving system :£, is obtained from A'i, A'2, A'3, etc., by means of a deformation (tz• f, f ). According to what has been said in § 8, the centres will of themselves take these positions A'1, A'2, A'3, etc., if originally, before there was a translation, they occupied the positions Ai, A2, A3 , etc. We may conceive a.ny point P' in the space of the system :£' to be displaced by the above deformation, so that a definite point P of :£ corresponds to it. For two corre- sponding points P' and P we shall define corresponding instants, the one belonging to P', the other to P, by stating that the true time at the first instant is equal to the local time, as determined by (5) for the point P, a.t the second instant. By corresponding times for two corresponding particles we shall understand times that may be said to correspond, if we fix our attention on the centres A' a.nd A of these particles. (b) As regards the interior state of the a.toms, we shall as- sume that the configuration of a particle A in :£ at a certain 26 ELECTROMAGNE'l'IC PHENOMENA time may be derived by means of the deformation (Jl' f, f) from the configuration of the corresponding particle in ~·, such as it is at the corresponding instant. In so far as this assumption relates to the form of the electrons them- selves, it is implied in the first hypothesis of § 8. Obviously, if we start from a state really existing in the system ~·. we have now completely defined a state of the moving system~- The question remains, however, whether this state will likewise be a possible one. In order to judge of this, we may remark in the first place that the electric moments which we have supposed to exist in the moving system and which we shall denote by P, will be certain definite functions of the co-ordinates x, y, z of the centres A of the particles, or, as we shall say, of the co- ordinates of the particles themselves, and of the time t. The equations which express the relations between P on one hand and x, y, z, t on the other, may be replaced by other equations containing the vectors P' defined by (26) and the quantities x', y', z', t' defined by (4) and (5). Now, by the above as- sumptions a and b, if in a particle A of the moving system, whose co-ordinates are x, y, z, we find an electric moment P at the time t, or at the local time t', the vector P' given by (26) will be the moment which exists in the other system at the true time t' in a particle whose co-ordinates are x', y', z'. It appears in this way that the equations between P', x', y', z', t' are the same for both systems, the difference being only this, that for the system ~' without translation these symbols indicate the moment, the co-ordinates, and the true time, whereas their meaning is different for the moving system, P', x', y', z', t' being here related to the moment P, the oo-ordin- ates x, y, z and the general time t in the manner expressed by (26), (4), and (5). It has already been stated that the equation (27) applies to both systems. The vector D' will therefore be the same in I' and ~. provided we always compare corresponding places and times. However, this vector has not the same meaning in the two cases. In !' it represents the electric force, in ! it is related to this force in the way expressed by (20). We may therefore conclude that the ponderomotive H. A. LORENTZ 27 forces acting, in i and in \"i,', on corresponding particles at corresponding instants, bear to each other the relation deter- mined by (21). In virtue of our assumption (b), taken in con- nexion with the second hypothesis of § 8, the same relation will exist between the \"elastic\" forces; consequently, the formula (21) may also be regarded as indicating the rela.tion between the total forces, acting on corresponding electrons, at corresponding instants. It is clear that the state we have supposed to exist in the moving system will really be possible if, in \"i, and \";£', the pro- ducts of the mass m and the acceleration of an electron are to each other in the same relation as the forces, i.e. if -( 2 z2 z2) , ma(\"i.) - l , -ri· # ma(\"i,) . (32) Now, we have for the accelerations a(\"i.) = (Ja• ~2 , ;~)a(\"i.') · . (33) as may be deduced from (4) and (5), and combining this with (32), we find for the masses m(i) = (fJ3l, fJl, fJl)m(\"i.'). If this is compared with (31), it appears that, whatever be the value of l, the condition is always satisfied, as regards the masses with which we have to reckon when we consider vibrations perpendicular to the translation. The only con- dition we have to impose on l is therefore d~;v> = f)az. But, on account of (3), d(fJv) = fJ3 dv ' so that we must put dl dv = 0, l = const. The value of the constant must be unity, because we know already that, for v = 0, l = 1. 28 ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA We are therefore led to suppose that the influence of a translation on the dimensions {of the separate electrons and of a ponderable body as a whole) is confined to those that have the direction of the motion, these becoming fJ times smaller than they are in the state of rest. If this hypothesis is added to those we have already made, we may be sure that two states, the one in the moving system, the other in the same system while at rest, corresponding as stated above, may both be possible. Moreover, this correspondence is not limited to the electric moments of the particles. In corre.: sponding points that are situated either in the ether between the particles, or in that surrounding the ponderable bodies, we shall find at corresponding times the same vector D' and, as is easily shown, the same vector H'. We may sum up by saying: If, in the system without translation, there is a state of motion in which, at a definite place, the components of P, D, and H are certain functions c:if the time, then the same system after it has been put in motion (and thereby deformed) can be the seat of a state of motion in which, at the corre- sponding place, the components of P', D', and H' are the same functions of the local time. There is one point which requires further consideration. The values of the masses mi and m2 having been deduced from the theory of quasi-stationary motion, the question arises, whether we are justified in reckoning with them in the case of the rapid 'ribrations of light. Now it is found on closer examination that the motion of an electron may be treated as quasi-stationary if it changes very little during the time a light-wave takes to travel over a distance equal to the diameter. This condition is fulfilled in optical phenomena, because the diameter of an electron is extremely small in com- parison with the wave-length. § 11. It is easily seen that the proposed theory can account for a large number of facts. Let us take in the first place the case of a system without translation, in some parts of which we have continually P = 0, D = 0, H = 0. Then, in the corresponding state for the moving system, we shall have in corresponding parts (or, as we may say, in the same parts of the deformed system) P' = 0, D' == 0, H' - 0. These equations implying P = 0, H. A. LORENTZ 29 D = 0, H ... O,.as is seen by (26) and (6), it appears that those parts which are dark while the system is at rest, will remain so after it has been put in motion. It will therefore be im- possible to detect an influence of the Earth's motion on any optical experiment, made with a terrestrial source of light, in which the geometrical distribution of light and darkness is observed. Many experiments on interference and diffraction belong to this class. In the second place, if, in two points of a system, rays of light of the same state of polarization are propagated in the same direction, the ratio between the amplitudes in these points may be shown not to be altered by a translation. The latter remark applies to those experiments in which the intensities in adjacent parts of the field of view are compared. The above conclusions confirm the results which I formerly obtained by a similar train of reasoning, in which, however, the terms of the second order were neglected. They also contain an explanation of Michelson's negative result, more general than the one previously given, and of a somewhat different form; and they show why Rayleigh and Brace could find no signs of double refraction produced by the motion of the Earth. As to the experiments of Trouton and Noble, their negative result becomes at once clear, if we admit the hypo- theses of § 8. It may be inferred from these and from our last assumption (§ 10) that the only effect of the translation must have been a contraction of the whole system of elec- trons and other particles constituting the charged condenser and the beam and thread of the torsion-balance. Such a contraction does not give rise to a sensible change of direction. It need hardly be said that the present theory is put for- ward with all due reserve. Though it seems to me that it can account for all well-established facts, it leads to some consequences that cannot as yet be put to the test of experi- ment. One of these is that the result of Michelson's experi- ment must remain negative, if the interfering rays of light are made to travel through some ponderable transparent body. Our assumption about the contraction of the electrons 80 ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA cannot in itself be pronounced to be either plausible or in- admissible. What we know about the nature of electrons is very little, and the only means of pushing our way farther will be to test such hypotheses as I have here made. Of course, there will be difficulties, e.g. as soon as we come to consider the rotation of electrons. Perhaps we shall have to suppose that in those phenomena in which, if there is no translation, spherical electrons rotate about a diameter, the points of the electrons in the moving system will describe elliptic paths, corresponding, in the manner specified in § 10, to the circular paths described in the other case. § 12. There remain to be said a, few words about molecular motion. We may conceive that bodies in which this has a sensible influence or even predominates, undergo the same deformation as the systems of particles of constant relative position of which alone we have spoken till now. Indeed, in two systems of molecules I' and I, the first without and the second with a translation, we may imagine molecular motions corresponding to each other in such a way that, if a particle in '$' has a certain position at a definite instant, a particle in '$ occupies at the corresponding instant the corresponding position. This being assumed, we may use the relation (33) between the accelerations in all those cases in which the velocity of molecular motion is very small as compared with v. In these cases the molecular forces may be taken to be deter- mined by the relative positions, independently of the velocities of molecular motion. If, finally, we suppose these forces to be limited to such small distances that, for particles acting on each other, the difference of local times may be neglected, one of the particles, together with those which lie in its sphere of attraction or repulsion, will form a system which undergoes the often mentioned deformation. In virtue of the second hypothesis of § 8 we may therefore apply to the resulting molecular force acting on a particle, the equation (21). Consequently, the proper relation between the forces and the accelerations will exist in the two cases, if we sup- pose that the masses of all particles are influenced by a trans- lation to the same degree as the electromagnetic masses of the electrons. § 13. The values (30), which I have found for the longi- H. A. LOREN'rZ 81 tudinal and transverse masses of an electron, expressed in terms of its velocity, are not the same as those that had been previously obtained by Abraham. The ground for this difference is to be sought solely in the circumstance that, in his theory, the electrons are treated as spheres of invariable dimensions. Now, as regards the transverse mass, the re- sults of Abraham have been confirmed in a most remarkable way by Kaufmann's measurements of the deflexion of radium-rays in electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, if there is not to be a most serious objection to the theory I have now proposed, it must be possible to show that those measurements agree with my values nearly as well as with those of Abraham. I shall begin by discussing two of the series of measure- ments published by Kaufmann.* in 1902. From each series he has deduced two quantities 1J and t, the \" reduced \" electric and magnetic deflexions, which a.re related as follows to the ratio ry = v/c :- 'Y = k1!, vC'Y> = k:r . <34) Here ,[, (,y) is such a function, that the transverse mass is given by . (35) whereas k1 and k 2 are constant in each series. It appears from the second of the. fonnulre (30) that my theory leads likewise to an equation of the form (35) ; only . Abraham's function ,; (ry) must be replaced by 4 4 3fl = 3(1 - ,y2)-Ifs. Hence, my theory requires that, if we substitute this value for ,fr (ry) in (34), these equations shall still hold. Of course, in seeking to obtain a good agreement, we shall be justified in giving to k1 and k_ other values than those of Kaufmann, and in taking for every measurement a proper value of the velocity v, or of the ratio ry. Writing sk1, ~ k'1 * Kaufmann, Physik. Zeitschr., 4, 1902, p. 55. 82 ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA and ,y' for the new values, we may put (34) in the form and , kt 'Y = s c 'I'/ (36) . (37) Kaufmann has tested his equations by choosing for k1 such a value that, calculating 'Y and k2 by means of (34), he obtained values for this latter number which, as well as might be, remained constant in each series. This constancy was the proof of a sufficient agreement. I have followed a similar method, using, however, some of the numbers calculated by Kaufmann. I have computed for each measurement the value of the expression k'~ ... (1 - ,y'2)112,t,( ,y)k~, . (38) that may be got from (37) combined with the second of the equations (34). The values of ,fr (,y) and k 2 have been taken from Kaufmann's tables, and for ,y' I have substituted the value he has found for \"/, multiplied bys, the latter coefficient being chosen with a view to obtaining a good constancy of (38). The results are contained in the tables on opposite page, corresponding to the Tables III and IV in Kaufmann's paper. The constancy of k'2 is seen to come out no less satis- factorily than that of k2, the more so as in each case the value of s has been determined by means of only two measure- ments. The coefficient has been so chosen that for these two observations, which were in Table III the first and the last but one, and in Table IV the first and the last, the values of k',. should be proportional to those of k2 • I shall next consider two series from a later publication by Kaufmann,* which have been calculated by Runge t by means of the method of least squares, the coefficients k1 and k2 having been determined in such a way that the values of 'I'/, calculated, for each observed t, from Kaufmann's equations (34), agree as closely as may be with the observed values of \"1· * Kaufmann, Gott.

EINSTEIN Translated from \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Karper,\" Annalen der Physik, 17, 1905. ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES BY A. EINSTEIN I T is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics-as usu- ally understood at the present time-when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a con- ductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, where- as the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the con- ductor a.t rest, there a.rises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, pro- ducing a current at the places where. parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the con- ductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighbour- hood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force, to which in itself there is no correspond- ing energy, but which gives rise-assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed-to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case. Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful at- tempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the \"light medium,\" suggest that the phenomena of electro- dynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corre- sponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of 37 88 ELECTRODYNAMICS mecha.nics hold good.* We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will herea.fter be called the \"Principle of Relativity\") to the status of a. postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only appa.rently irreconcila.ble with the former, na.mely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. These two postula.tes suffice for the a.tta.inment of a simple a.nd consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies ba.sed on Maxwell's theory for sta.tiona.ry bodies. The introduction of a \"luminiferous ether\" will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an \" ab- solutely stationary space\" provided with special properties, nor a.ssign a velocity-vector to a. point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes ta.ke place. The theory to be developed is based-like a.II electro- dyna.mics-on the kinematics of the rigid body, since the assertions of a.ny such theory have to do with the relation- ships between rigid bodies (systems of co-ordinates), clocks, a.nd electromagnetic processes. Insufficient consideration of this circumstance lies at the root of the difficulties which the electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters. I .. KINEM.A.TICAL PART § 1. Definition of Simultaneity Let us take a. system of co-ordinates in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold good. t In order to .render our presentation more precise and to distinguish this system of co-ordina.tes verbally from others which will be introduced hereafter, we call it the \"stationary system.\" If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of co-ordinates, its position can be defined rela.tively thereto by the employment of rigid standa.rds of mea.surement and the methods of Euclidea.n geometry, a.nd can be expressed in Cartesian co-ordinates. If we wish to describe the motion of a. material point, we * The preceding memoir by Lorentz was not a.t this time known to the author. t i.e. to the first approximation. A. EINSTEIN 89 give the values of its co-ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by \"time.\" We have to take into account that all our judgments in which time plays a ,part are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for instance, I say, \"That train arrives here at 7 o'clock,\" I mean something like this: '' The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.\"* It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending the definition of \" time \" by substituting \" the position of the small hand of my watch \" for \" time.\" And in fact such a definition is satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located ; but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events occurring at different places, or-what comes to the same thing-to evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the watch. We might, of course, content ourselves with time values determined by an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the co-ordinates, and co-ordinating the corre- sponding positions of the hands with light signals, given out by every event to be timed, and reaching him through empty space. But this co-ordination has the disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the observer with the watch or clock, as we know from experience. We arrive at a much more practical determination along the following line of thought. If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood of B. But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in * We shall not here discuss the inexactitude which lurks in the concept of simultaneity of two events at e.pproxime.tely the same pie.ca, which ce.n only be removed by an abstraction. 40 ELECTRODYNAMICS respect of time, an event at A with an event a.t B. We have so f a.r defined only an \" A time \" and a \" B time.\" We have not defined a common \" time \" for A and B, for the la.tter cannot be defined at all unless we establish by definition that the \"time\" required by light to travel from A to B equals the \" time \" it requires to travel from B to A. Let a. ray of light start at the \"A time\" tA from A towards B, let it a.t the \" B time\" tB be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A at the \"A time\" t'A In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if tB - tA = t'A - tB, We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from contradictions, and possible for any number of points ; and that the following relations are universally valid :- 1. If the clock at B synchronizes with the clock at A, the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B. 2. If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B and a.lso with the clock at C, the clocks at B and C also syn- chronize with each other. Thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experi- ments we have settled what is to be understood by synchron- ous stationary clocks located at different places, and have evidently obtained a definition of \"simultaneous,\" or \"syn- chronous,\" and of \"time.\" The \"time\" of an event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a. .stationary clock located at the place of the event, this clock being synchronous, and indeed synchronous for all time deter- minations, with a specified stationary clock. In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity 2AB t , t = c, A - A to be a universal constant-the velocity of light in empty space. It is essential to have time defined by means of stationary clocks in the stationary system, and the time now defined being appropriate to the stationary system we call it \"the time of the stationary system.\" A. EINSTEIN 41 § 2. On the Relativity of Lengths and Times The following reflexions are based on the principle of relativity and on the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light. These two principles we define a.s follows:- 1. The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change a.re not affected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems of co- ordinates in uniform transla.tory motion. 2. Any ra.y of light moves in the \" stationary \" system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body. Hence . light path velomty = t. . t 1 1me m erva where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the definition in§ 1. Let there be given a stationary rigid rod; and let its length be l as measured by a measuring-rod which is also stationary. We now imagine the axis of the rod lying along the axis of x of the stationary system of co-ordinates, and that a. uniform motion of parallel translation with velocity v along the axis of x in the direction of increasing x is then imparted to the rod. We now inquire a.s to the length of the moving rod, and imagine its length to be ascertained by the following two operations :- (a) The observer moves together with the given measur- ing-rod and the rod to be measured, and measures the length of the rod directly by superposing the measuring-rod, in just the same way as if all three were a.t rest. (b) By means of stationary clocks set up in the stationary system and synchronizing in accordance with § 1, the ob- server ascertains at what points of the stationary system the two ends of the rod to be measured are located at a definite time. The distance between these two points, measured by the measuring-rod already employed, which in this case is at rest, is also a length which may be designated \"the length of the rod.\" In accordance with the principle of relativity the length 42 ELECTRODYNAMICS to be discovered by the operation (a)-we will call it \"the length of the rod in the moving system \"-must be equal to the length l of the stationary rod. The length to be discovered by the operation (b) we will call \" the length of the (moving) rod in the stationary system.\" This we shall determine on the basis of our two principles, and we shall find that it differs from l. Current kinematics tacitly assumes that the lengths deter- mined by these two operations are precisely equal, or in other words, that a moving rigid body at the epoch t may in geo- metrical respects be perfectly represented by the same body at rest in a definite position. We imagine further that at the two ends A and B of the rod, clocks are placed which synchronize with the clocks of the stationary system, that is to say that their indications correspond at any instant to the \"time of the stationary system\" at the places where they happen to be. These clocks are therefore \"synchronous in the stationary system.\" We imagine further that with each clock there is a mov- ing observer, and that these observers apply to both clocks the criterion established in § 1 for the synchronization of two clocks. Let a ray of light depart from A at the time* tA, let it be reflected at B at the time tB, and reach A again at the time t'A· Ta.king into consideration the principle of the con- stancy of the velocity of light we find that where r AB denotes the length of the moving rod-measured in the stationary system. Observers moving with th~ moving rod would thus find that the two clocks were not synchronous, while observers in the stationary system would declare the clocks to be synchronous. So we see that we cannot attach any absolute signification to the concept of simultaneity, but that two events which, viewed from a system of co-ordinates, are simultaneous, can no longer be looked upon as simultaneous events when en- *\"Time\" here denotes\" time of the stationary system\" and a.lso \"posi- · tion of hands of the moving clock situated e.t the ple.oe under discussion.\" A. EINSTEIN 48 visaged from a system which is in motion relatively to that system. § 3. Theory of the Transformation of Co-ordinates and Times from a Stationary System to another System in Uniform Motion of Translation R.elatively to the Former Let us in \" stationary \" space take two systems of co- ordinates, i.e. two systems, each of three rigid material lines, perpendicular to one another, and issuing from a point. Let the axes of X of the two systems coincide, and their axes of Y and Z respectively be parallel. Let each system be provided with a rigid measuring-rod and a number of clocks, and let the two measuring-rods, and likewise all the clocks of the two systems, be in all respects alike. Now to the origin of one of the two systems (k) let a con- stant velocity v be imparted in the direction of the increasing x of the other stationary system (K), and let this velocity be communicated to the axes of the co-ordinaies, the relevant measuring-rod, and the clocks. To any time of the stationary system K there then will correspond a definite position of the axes of the moving system, and from reasons of symmetry we are entitled to assume that the motion of k may be such that the axes of the moving system are at the time t (this \"t\" always denotes a time of the stationary system) parallel to the axes of the stationary system. We now imagine space to be measured from the stationary system K by means of the stationary measuring-rod, and also from the moving system k by means of the measuring-rod moving with it ; and that we thus obtain the co-ordinates x, y, z, and f, 'T/, , respectively. Further, let the time t of the stationary system be determined for all points thereof at which there are clocks by means of light signals in the manner indicated in § 1 ; similarly let the time T of the moving system be determined for all points of the moving system at which there are clocks at rest relatively to that system by applying the method, given in § 1, of light signals between the points at which the latter clocks are located. To any system of values x, y, z, t, which completely defines the place and time of an event in the stationary system, there 44 ELEC1.'RODYN AMI CS belongs a system of values E, 'T/, t, T, determining that event relatively to the system k, and our task is now to find the system of equations connecting these quantities. In the first place it is clear that the equations must be linear on account of the properties of homogeneity which we attribute to space and time. If we place x' = x - vt, it is clear that a point at rest in the system k must have a system of values x', y, z, inde- pendent of time. We first define T as a function of x', y, z,· and t. To do this we have to express in equations that T is nothing else than the summary of the data of clocks at rest in system k, which have been synchronized according to the rule given in § 1. From the origin of system k let a ray be emitted at the time To along the X-axis to x', and at the time r 1 be reflected thence to the origin of the co-ordinates, arriving there at the time T 2 ; we then must have t (T0 + T 2) = r 1, or, by inserting the arguments of the function T and applying the principle of the coµstancy of the velocity of light in the stationary system:- [ ( x' x' ) J ( , x' ) t r(O, 0, 0, t) + T 0, 0, 0, t + - + -- = r x , 0, 0, t + -- . c-v c+v c-v Hence, if x' be chosen infinitesimally small, ( 1 1 ) \"llr \"llr 1 \"llr t c - 1, + c + v. \"ilt = \"ilx' + c - v u• or <lT V <lT ,, + • 2 't = 0. uJ; c· - v u It is to be noted that instead of the origin of the co-ordin- ates we might have chosen any other point for the point of origin of the ray, and the equation just obtained is therefore valid for all values of x', y, z. An analogous consideration-applied to the axes of Y and Z-it being borne in mind that light is always propagated along these axes, when viewed from the stationary system, with the velocity ~(o 2 - v2), gives us <l7' = 0 <lT = 0 \"ily, ' ~z . A. EINSTEIN 45 Since T is a linear function, it follows from these equations that T = a(t - -\"'-x') c2 - v2 where a is a. function cf>(v) a.t present unknown, and where for brevity it is assumed that a.t the origin of k, T = 0, when t = 0. With the help of this result we easily determine the quantities E, '1/, t by expressing in equations that light (a.s re- quired by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, in combination with the principle of relativity) is also propagated with velocity c when measured in the moving system. For a. ray of light emitted a.t the time .,. = 0 in the direction of the increasing E E = CT or E = ac(t - 2 v ~x'). c - v But the ray moves relatively to the initial point of k, when measured in the stationary system, with the vJlocity c - v, so tba.t x' -- = t. c - v If we insert this value of t in the equation for E, we obtain c2 I E = a-s--2x. c - v In a.n analogous manner we find, by considering rays moving a.long the two other axes, that when Thus c c '1/ = a .../(c2 - vsl and t = a ...j(cz - v2t· Substituting for x' its value, we obtain 46 where ELECTRODYNAMICS T = <f,(v)/3(t - vx/c2), ~ = <f,(v)/3(x - vt), 'T/ = <f,(v)y, t = <f,(v)z, 1 /3 = ~(l-v 2/c2)' and <f, is an as yet unknown function of v. If no assumption whatever be made as to the initial position of the moving system and as to the zero point of ,-, an additive constant is to be placed on the right side of each of these equations. We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving system, is propagated with the velocity c, if, as we have assumed, this is the case in the stationary system; for we have not as yet furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity. At the time t = T = 0, when the origin of the co-ordinates is common to the two systems, let a spherical wave be emitted therefrom, and be propagated with the velocity c in system K. If (x, y, z) be a point just attained by this wave, then x2 + y2 + zs ... c2t2. Transforming this equation with the aid of our equations of transformation we obtain after a. simple calculation ~ + ,,,2 + r = c2-r2. The wave under consideration is therefore no less a spherical wave with velocity of propagation c when viewed in the moving system. This shows that our two funda- mental principles are compatible.* In the equations of transformation which have been de- veloped there enters an unknown function <f, of v, which we will now determine. For this purpose we introduce a third system of co-ordin- * The equations of the Lorentz transformation may be more simply de· duced directly from the condition that in virtue of those equations the re· lation a:• + y• + :a• = c•t• shall have a.s its consequence the second relation t• + f/2 + (A - c•-r•. A. EINSTEIN 47 a.tes K', which relatively to the system k is in a state of parallel translatory motion parallel to the a.xis of X, such that the origin of co-ordinates of system k moves with velocity - v on the a.xis of X. At the time t = 0 let a.11 three origins coincide, a.nd when t = x = y = z = 0 let the time t' of the system K' be zero. We ca.11 the co-ordinates, measured in the system K; x', y', z', and by a twofold application of our equations of transformation we obtain t' = cf,( - v)f)( - ·v)(T + vf/c2 ) = cf,(v)cf,( - v)t, x' = cf,(- v)f)( - v)(E + VT) = cf,(v)cf,( - v)x, y' = cf,(- v)'TJ = cf,(v)cf,( - v)y, z' = cf,(- v)t\" = cf,(v)cf,( - v)z. Since the relations between x', y', z' a.nd x, y, z do not contain the time t, the systems K a.nd K' are a.t rest with re- spect to one another, a.nd it is clear that the transformation from K to K' must be the identical transformation. Thus cf,(v)cf,( - v) = 1. We now inquire into the signification of cf,(v). We give our attention to that part of the a.xis of Y of system k which lies between E = 0, '1J = 0, t\" = 0 a.nd E = 0, '1J = l, t\" = 0. This pa.rt of the a.xis of Y is a rod moving perpendicularly to its axis with velocity v relatively to system K. Its ends possess in K the co-ordinates l x1 - vt, 1/i - cf,(v)' z1 - 0 and x2 - vt, y 2 - 0, z2 - 0. The length of the rod measured in K is therefore l/4,(v); and this gives us the meaning of the function cf,(v). From reasons of symmetry it is now evident that the length of a. given rod moving perpendicularly to its axis, measured in the stationary system, must depend only on the velocity a.nd not on the direction and the sense of the motion. The length of the moving rod measured in the stationary system does not change, therefore, if v and - v a.re interchanged. Hence follows that l/</>(v) = lief,( - v), or cf,(v) - cf,( - v). It follows from this relation and the one previously found 48 ELECTRODYNAMICS that c/>(.v) = 1, so that the transformation equations which have been found become where T = f)(t - vx/c2), E = f)(x - vt), \"I= y, t = z, f1 = 1/-/(1 - v2/c2). § 4. Physical Meaning of the Equations Obtained in Re- spect to Moving Rigid Bodies and Moving Clocks We envisage a rigid sphere * of radius R, at rest relatively to the moving system k, and with its centre at the origin of co-ordinates of k. The equation of the surface of this sphere moving relatively to the system K with velocity v is r + ,,,, + r = R 2• The equation of this surface expressed in x, y, z at the time t = 0 is x2 2 2_ 2 (-/(1 - v2/c2))2 + y + z - R. A rigid body which, measured in a state of rest, has the form of a sphere, therefore has in a state of motion-viewed from the stationary system-the form of an ellipsoid of revolution with the axes R J(l - v2/c2), R, R. Thus, whereas the Y and Z dimensions of the sphere (and therefore of every rigid body of no matter what form) do not appear modified by the motion, the X dimension appears shortened in the ratio 1 : -/ (1 - v2 I c2), i.e. the greater the value of v, the greater the shortening. For v = c a.11 moving objects-viewed from the \" stationary \" system-shrivel up into plain figures. For velocities greater than that of light our deliberations become meaningless ; we shall, however, find in what follows, that the velocity of light in our theory plays the part, physically, of an infinitely great velocity. * The.t is, a. body possessing spherical form when examined e.t rest. A. EINSTEIN 49 It is clear that the same results hold good of bodies at rest in the \" stationary \" system, viewed from a system in uniform motion. Further, we imagine one of the clocks which are q~aJified to mark the time t when at rest relatively to the stationary system, and the time T when at rest relatively to the moving system, to be located at the origin of the co-ordinates of k, and so adjusted that it marks the time T. What is the rate of this clock, when viewed from the stationary system? Between the quantities x, t, and T, which refer to the position of the clock, we have, evidently, x = vt and 'l'herefore, T = t.j(l - v2/c2) = t - (1 - .j(l - v2/c2))t whence it follows that the time marked by the clock (viewed in the stationary system) is slow by 1 - ..j(l - v2/c2) seconds per. second, or-neglecting magnitudes of fourth and higher order-by tv2/c2• From this there ensues the following peculiar consequence. If at the points A and B of K there are stationary clocks which, viewed in the stationary system, are synchronous; and if the clock at A is moved with the velocity v along the line AB to B, then on its arrival at B the two clocks no longer synchronize, but the clock moved from A to B lags behind the other which has remained at B by ttv 2/c2 (up to magni- tudes of fourth and higher_order), t being the time occupied in the journey from A to B. It is at once apparent that this result still holds good if the clock moves from A to B in any polygonal line, and also when the points A and B coincide. If we assume that the result proved for a polygonal line is also valid for a continuously curved line, we arrive at this result : If one of two synchronous clocks at A is moved in a closed curve with constant velocity until it returns to A, the journey lasting t seconds, then by the clock which has remained at rest the travelled clock on its arrival at A will be ttv2/c2 second slow. Thence we conclude that a 50 ELECTRODYNAMICS ha.la.nee-clock * a.t the equator must go more slowly, by a very small a.mount, than a. precisely similar clock situated a.t one of the poles under otherwise identical conditions. § 5. The Composition of Velocities In the system k moving a.long the a.xis of X of the system K with velocity v, let a. point move in accordance with the equations E = w~T, \"1 = w.,,T, ~ = 0, where w~ and w.,, denote constants. Reqmred : the motion of the point relatively to the system K. If with the help of the equations of transformation de- veloped in § 3 we introduce the quantities x, y, z, t into the equations of motion of the point, we obtain x - w! + v t - 1 + vw(/c2' \"\"(1 - v2 / ell) y = 1 + vwi/c2 w.,,t, z = 0. Thus the la.w of the pa.ra.llelogra.m of velocities is valid ac- cording to our theory only to a. first approximation. We set (dx)11 (dy)11 V11 = dt + dt ' w2 = wl + w.,,2, a = tan - 1 wy/wa:, a is then to be looked upon as the angle between the velocities v and w. After a. simple calculation we obtain V _ \"\"[(v2 + w 11 + 2vw cos a) - (vw sin a/c2)2] - 1 + vw cos a/c2 · It is worthy of remark that v and w enter into the expression for the resultant velocity in a symmetrical manner. If w also has the direction of the a.xis of X, we get v + w V = 1 + vw/c2' * Not a. pendulum-clock, which is physice.lly a. system to which the Ee.rth belongs. This ce.se he.d to be excluded. A. EINSTEIN 51 It follows from this equation that from a. composition of two velocities which a.re less tha.n c, there a.lwa.ys results a velocity less than c. For if we set v = c - \"• w = c - >.., ,c and >.. being positive and less than c, then 2c-,c->.. v = c I <c. 2c - IC - A + ,c)., C It follows, further, tha.t the velocity of light c cannot be altered by composition with a velocity less than tha.t of light. For this case we obtain c + w v = I = c. 1 + w c We might also have obtained the formula. for V, for the case when v and w have the same direction, by compounding two transformations in accordance with § 3. If in addition to the systems K and k figuring in § 3 we introduce still another system of co-ordinates k' moving parallel to k, its initial point moving on the a.xis of X with the velocity w, we obtain equations between the qua.ntities x, y, z, t a.nd the corresponding quantities of k', which differ from the equa.tions found in § 3 only in tha.t the place of \" v \" is ta.ken by the quantity v + w . 1 + vw/c2 ' from which we see that such parallel transformations-neces- sarily-form a group. We have now deduced the requisite laws of the theory of kinematics corresponding to our two principles, and we pro- ceed to show their application to electrodynamics. II. ELECTRODYNAMIOAL PART § 6. Transformation of the Maxwell-Hertz Equations for Empty Space. On the Nature of the Electromotive Forces Occurring in a Magnetic Field During Motion Let the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space hold good for the stationary system K, so that we have 52 ELECTRODYNAMICS 1 3X 3N 3M 1 3L 3Y 3Z a~= 3y - ~· ;7u = -sz - 3y' l 3Y 3L 3N 13M 3Z ~x a~=~ - ~x· c~ = ~x - ~· l 3Z 3M 3L l~N ~x ~y a 7it = ~x - ~y' cM = -ay - ~x· where (X, Y, Z) denotes the vector of the electric force, and (L, M, N) that of the magnetic force. If we apply to these equations the transformation de- veloped in § 3, by referring the electromagnetic processes to the system of co-ordinates there introduced, moving with the velocity v, we obtain the equations i ~! = ~: {13( N - ~y)} - :t{/3( M + ;Z)}, - :t{13(N - *Y)}· where fJ = 1/,./(1 - v2/c2). Now the principle of relativity requires that if the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space hold good in system K, they also hold good in system k; that is to say that the vectors of the electric and the magnetic force-(X', Y', Z') and (L', M', N')-of the moving system k, which are defined by their ponderomotive effects on electric or magnetic masses respectively, satisfy the following equations:- A. EINSTEIN 1 i)X' i)N' i)M' c~ = i)11 - ~· I i)y1 i)L' i)N' C i)T = ~ -1~ 1 1 i)Z' i)M' i)L' c ~ = i)E - ~· I i)L' i) Y' i)Z' cTT = ~ - i)11' 1 i)M' i)Z' i)X' C i)T = ~ - ~' 1 i)N' i)X' i) Y' --=-·-~ c i)T <)11 i)E 58 Evidently the two systems of equations found for system k must express exactly the same thing, since both systems of equations are equivalent to the Maxwell-Hertz equations for system K. Since, further, the equations of the two systems agree, with the exception of the symbols for the vectors, it follows that the functions occurring in the systems of equa- tions at corresponding places must agree, with the exception of a factor ,fr(v), which is common for all functions of the one system of equations, and is independent of ~. 11, , and T but depends upon v. Thus we have the relations X' = ,fr(v)X, L' = ,fr(v)L, Y' = ,fr(v)#(Y - ~N), M' = t(v)#(M + ~z), Z' = ,fr(v)#(Z + ~M), N' = t(v)#(N - ~Y). If we now form the reciprocal of this system of equations, firstly by solving the equations just obtained, a.nd secondly by applying the equations to the inverse transformation (from k to K), which is characterized by the velocity - v, it follows, when we. consider that the two systems of equations thus ob- tained must be identical, that ,fr(v),y( - v) = 1. Further, from reasons of symmetry* ,fr(v) = ,y( - v), and therefore ,fr(v) = 1, and our equations assume the form • If, for exa.mple, X = Y = Z = L = M = 0, and N =+ 0, then from reasons of symmetry it is clear that when v changes sign without changing its numerical ve.lue, Y' must also change sign without changing its numerical value. 54 ELECTRODYNAMICS X'=X, L' = L, Y' = ,e(Y - ~N), M' = .B(M + ~z), Z' = ,e(z + ~M), N' = ,e(N - ~Y). As to the interpretation of these equations we make the following remarks : Let a point charge of electricity have the magnitude \"one\" when measured in the stationary system K, i.e. let it when at rest in the stationary system exert a force of one dyne upon an equal quantity of electricity at a distance of one cm. By the principle of relativity this electric charge is also of the magnitude \" one \" when measured in the moving system. If this quantity of elec- tricity is at rest relatively to the stationary system, then by definition the vector (X, Y, Z) is equal to the force acting upon it. If the quantity of electricity is at rest relatively to the moving system (at least at the relevant instant), then the force acting upon it, measured in the moving system, is equal to the vector (X', Y', Z'). Consequently the first three equations above allow themselves to be clothed in words in the two following ways:- 1. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic field, there acts upon it, in addition to the electric force, an \" electromotive force \" which, if we neglect the terms multiplied by the second and higher powers of v/c, is equal to the vector-product of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic force, divided by the velocity of light. (Old manner of expression.) 2. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic field, the force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the charge, and which we ascertain by transformation of the field to a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge. (New manner of expression.) The analogy holds with \"magnetomotive forces.\" We see that electromotive force plays in the developed theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept, which owes its intro- duction to the circumstance that electric and magnetic forces A. EINSTEIN 55 do not exist independently of the state of motion of the system of co-ordinates. Furthermore it is clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction as arising when we consider the currents produced by the relative motion of a magnet and a conductor, now disappears. Moreover, questions as to the \" seat \" of electrodynamic electromotive forces (unipolar ma.chines) now have no point. § 7. Theory of Doppler's Principle and of Aberration In the system K, very far from the origin of eo-ordina.tes, let there be a source of electrodynamic waves, which in a pa.rt of space containing the origin of co-ordinates may be represented to a. sufficient degree of approximation by the equations where X = X 0 sin <I>, L = L 0 sin <I>, Y = Y0 sin <I>, M = M0 sin <I>, Z = Z 0 sin <I>, N = N0 sin <I>, <I> = Ci>{ t - ~(lx + my + nz)}. Here (X0, Y0 , Z 0) and (L 0, M0, N0) a.re the vectors defining the amplitude of the wave-train, and l, m, n the direction- cosines of the wave-normals. We wish to know the consti- tution of these waves, when they are examined by an observer at rest in the moving system k. Applying the equations of transformation found in § 6 for electric and magnetic forces, and those found in § 3 for the co-ordinates and the time, we obtain directly X' = X 0 sin <I>', L' = L 0 sin <I>', Y' = /3(Y0 - vN 0/c) sin <I>', M' = fJ(M0 + vZ 0/c) sin <I>', Z' = fJ(Z 0 + vM0/c) sin <I>', N' = fJ(N 0 - vYofc) sin <I>', <I>'= Ci>'{'T -· ~(l'E + m''TJ + n't)} 56 ELECTRODYNAMICS where a:,' = a:,fJ(l - lv/c), l' = l - v/c 1 - lv/c' I m m = -==,---,,--,-,- fJ ( l - lv/c)' I n n \"\"fJ(l - lv/c) · From the equation for a:,' it follows that if an observer is moving with velocity v relatively to an infinitely distant source of light of frequency v, in such a way that the connect- ing line \" source-observer \" makes the angle cf, with the velocity of the observer referred to a system of co-ordinates which is at rest relatively to the source of light, the frequency v' of the light perceived by the observer is given by the equation , 1 - cos cf, • v/c v = v ~(l - v2/rr) . This is Doppler's principle for any velocities whatever. When cf> = 0 the equation assumes the perspicuous form , /1 - v/c v = v,yl + v/c· We see that, in contrast with the customary view, when v = - c, v' = co . If we call the angle between the wave-normal {direction of the ray) in the moving system and the connecting line \"source-observer\" cf>', the equation for l' assumes the form ..1..' cos cf, - v/c cos 'f' = . 1 - cos cf, . v/c This equation expresses the law of aberration in its most general form. If cf> = t ,r, the equation becomes simply cos cf,' = - v/c. We still have to find the amplitude of the waves, as it appears in the moving system. If we call the amplitude of the electric or magnetic force A or A' respectively, accordingly A. EINSTEIN 57 as it is measured in the stationary system or in the moving system, we obtain A'2 = Ail - cos (/,. v/c) 2 1 - v2/c2 which equation, if (/, = 0, simplifies into A'2 = A2l - v/c. 1 + v/c It follows from these results tha.t to a.n observer approach- ing a source of light with the velocity c, this source of light must appear of infinite intensity. § 8. Transformation of the Energy of Light R.ays. Theory of the Pressure of R.adiation Exerted on Perfect R.eflectors Since A2/81r equa.ls the energy of light per unit of volume, we have to regard A'2/87T', by the principle of relativity, as the energy of light in the moving system. Thus A'2/A2 would be the ratio of the \" measured in motion \" to the \" measured at rest\" energy of a given light complex, if the volume of a .light complex were the same, whether measured in K or in k. But this is not the ca.se. If l, m, n a.re the direction-cosines of the wave-normals of the light in the stationary system, no energy passes through the surface elements of a spherical surface moving with the velocity of light:- (x - lct) 2 + (y - mct) 2 + (z - nct) 2 = R 2 • We ma.y therefore say that this surface permanently encloses the same light complex. We inquire as to the quantity of energy enclosed by this surface, viewed in system k, that is, as to the energy of the light complex relatively to the system k. The spherical surface-viewed in the moving system-is an ellipsoidal surface, the equation for which, a.t the time T = 0, is (fJE - lfJE't;/c)2 + ('TJ - mfJEv/c)2 + (t - nfJEv/c)2 = R2 • If S is the volume of the sphere, and S' that of this ellipsoid, 58 ELECTRODYNAMICS then by a. simple ca.lcula.tion S' ,v'l - v 2/c2 S = 1 - COB <f, • v/c' Thus, if we ca.II the light energy enclosed by this surface E when it is mea.sured in the sta.tiona.ry system, a.nd E' when measured in the moving system, we obta.in E' A'2S' 1 - cos cf, • v/c E = A2S = ,v'(l - v2/c2) ' and this formula., when cf, = 0, simplifies into E' = .-yl - v/c E 1 + v/c' It is rema.rkable tha.t the energy and the frequency of a. light complex vary with the state of motion of the observer in a.ccordance with the sa.me la.w. Now let the co-ordina.te pla.ne E = 0 be a. perfectly reflect- ing surface, at which the pla.ne wa.ves considered in § 7 a.re reflected. We seek for the pressure of light exerted on the reflecting surface, and for the direction, frequency, and in- tensity of the light a.fter reflexion. Let the incidenta.l light be defined by the quantities A, cos cf,, v (referred to system K). Viewed from k the corre- sponding quantities are A' = A 1 - cos <f,. v/c \"'(1 - v2/c2) I , cos cf, - v/c cos<f, = ~~'-----''---:- 1 - cos </> . v/c' , 1 - cos cf> • v/c ,, = ,, ,v'(l - v2/c2) • For the reflected light, referring the process to system k, we obtain A\"= A' COB <p\" = - COB cf,' II I v = v Finally, by transforming back to the stationary system K, we obtain for the reflected light A. EINSTEIN 59 A\"' _ A''l + cos </,\" • v/c = A 1 - 2 cos <J,. v/c + v2/c2 ,v'(l - v2/c2) 1 - v2/c2 ' A..\"' cos cp\" + vie (I + v2/c\") cos cp - 2v/c cos.,.. = 1 + cos cp\". v/c = - 1 - 2 cos cp . v/c + v2/c2 ,,, ,,1 + cos <J,\"v/c 1 - 2 cos cp . v/c + v2/c2 \"' = v v'(l - v2/ci) = \"' 1 - v2/c2 • The energy (measured in the stationary system) which is incident upon unit area of the mirror in unit time is evidently A2(c cos cp - v)/81r. The energy leaving the unit of surface of the mirror in the unit of time is A\"'2( - c cos cp\"' + v)/81r. The difference of these two expressions is, by the principle of energy, the work done by the pressure of light in the unit of time. If we set down this work as equal to the product Pv, where P is the pressure of light, we obtain p = 2 A2 (cos cp - v/c)2 · 81r 1 - v2/c2 • In agreement with experiment and with other theories, we obtain to a first .approximation A2 P = 2 . 81rcos2 cf,. All problems in the optics of moving bodies can be solved by the method here employed. What is essential is, that the electric and magnetic force of the light which is influenced by a moving body, be transformed into a system of co-ordin- ates at rest relatively to the body. By this means all problems in the optics of moving bodies will be reduced to a series of problems in the optics of stationary bodies. § 9.

If we imagine the electric charges to be invariably coupled to small rigid bodie~ (ions, electrons), these equations are the electromagnetic basis of the Lorentzian electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies. Let these equations be valid in the system K, and trans- form them, with the assistance of the equations of transform- ation given in §§ 3 and 6, to the system k. We then obtain the equations where and l{i)X' , i)N' i)M' 1 i)L' i)Y' i)Z' c T,:\" + u{p} = ~ - i)' ' c T,:\" = ~ - ~· 1 fi)Y' '} i)L' i)N' 1 i)M' i)Z' i)X' c L i),- + U11P - i)' i)E ' c i),- - i)E i)s' ' l{i)Z' '} i)M' i)L' 1 i)N' i)X' i)Y' c ~ + U(P = i)E i)'I'/' c i),- i)'I'/ - i),' Ux - V u~ -- 1 - UxV/c'I.

Since-as follows from the theorem of addition of velocities (§ 5)-the vector (u~, u 11, U() is nothing else than the velocity of the electric charge, measured in the system k, we have the proof that, on the basis of our kinematical principles, the electrodynamic foundation of Lorentz's theory of the electro- dynamics of moving bodies is in agreement with the prin- ciple of relativity. In addition I may briefly remark that the following import- A. EINSTEIN 61 ant law may easily be deduced from the developed equations : If an electrically charged body is in motion anywhere in space without altering its charge when regarded from a system of co-ordinates moving with the body, i~s charge also remains-when regarded from the \" stationary \" system K- constant. § 1 o. Dynamics of the Slowly Accelerated Electron Let there be in motion in an electromagnetic field an electrically charged particle (in the sequel called an \" elec- tron\"), for the law of motion of which we assume a.s follows:- If the electron is at rest at a given epoch, the motion of the electron ensues in the next instant of time according to the equations d 2x mdt2 = eX d2y mdt~ = eY d 2z mdt2 = eZ where x, y, z denote the co-ordinates of the electron, and m the mass of the electron, as long as its motion is slow. Now, secondly, let the velocity of the electron at a given epoch be v. We seek the law of motion of the electron in the immediately ensuing instants of time. Without affecting the general character of our consider- ations, we may and will assume that the electron, at the moment when we give it our attention, is at the origin of the co-ordinates, and moves with the velocity v a.long the axis of X of the system K. It is then clear that at the given moment (t = 0) the electron is a.t rest relatively to a system of co-ordinates which is in parallel motion with velocity v a.long the a.xis of X. From the a.hove assumption, in combination with the principle of relativity, it is clear that in the immediately en- suing time (for small values of t) the electron, viewed from the system k, moves in accordance with the equations 62 ELEC'l'RODYN AMI CS d 2E , mdT2 = eX, d2'T} ' mdT2 = eY' d2t , md~ = eZ, in which the symbols E, 'TJ, t, T, X', Y', Z' refer to the system k. If, further, we decide that when t = x = y = z = 0 then T =- E = 'I = t = 0, the tra.nsformation equations of §§ 3 a.nd 6 hold good, so that we ha.ve E = f)(x - vt), 'TJ = y, '= z, T = f)(t - vx/rr) X' = X, Y' = f)(Y - vN/c), Z' = f)(Z + vM/c). With the help of these equations we transform the a.hove equations of motion from system k to system K, and obtain d2X E dt2 = m flax } d2y = _e (y - ~N) dt 2 m f) c d2z E ( V ) -= - Z +-M dt2 m f) c . (A) Ta.king the ordinary point of view we now inquire a.a to the \" longitudinal \" and the \" transverse \" ma.as of the moving electron. We write the equations (A) in the form d2x I mf)3 dt 2 = eX = eX , mf)2::r = efl( Y - ~N) = E Y', and remark firstly that eX', eY', eZ' a.re the components of the ponderomotive force acting upon the electron, and a.re so indeed as viewed in a. system moving at the moment with the electron, with the same velocity e.s the electron. (This force might be measured, for example, by a spring be.le.nee at rest A. EINSTEIN 63 in the la.st-mentioned system.) Now if we call this force simply \"the force acting upon the electron,\"• and ma.iota.in the equation-mass x acceleration = force-and if we also decide that the accelerations a.re to be measured in the stationary system K, we derive from the a.hove equations Longitudinal mass = ,.,.! m 21 2 3• ( 1-v c) m Transverse mass = 1 2; 2· - v c With a. different definition of force and acceleration we should naturally obtain other values for the masses. This shows us that in comparing different theories of the motion of the electron we must proceed very cautiously. We remark that these results a.s to the mass a.re also valid for pondera.ble material points, because a. pondera.ble material point can be ma.de into a.n electron (in our sense of the word) by the addition of an electric charge, no matter how small. We will now determine the kinetic energy of the electron. If an electron moves from rest at the origin of co-ordinates of the system K a.long the a.xis of X under the action of a.n electrostatic force X, it is clear that the energy withdrawn from the electrostatic field has the value f EXdx. As the elec- tron is to be slowly accelerated, and consequently may not give off any energy in the form of radiation, the energy withdrawn from the electrostatic field must be put down a.s equal to the energy of motion W of the electron. Bea.ring in mind tha.t during the whole process of motion which we a.re consid,ering, the first of the equations (A) applies, we therefore obtain W = J eXdx = m f ;{33vdv = mc2 {,.,.11 = v2jc'l. - 1}. Thus, when v = c, W becomes infinite. Velocities • The definition of force here given is not e.dve.nte.geons, e.s we.s first shown by M. Ple.nok. It is more to the point to define force in such a. we.y the.t the le.ws of momentum and energy assume the simplest form. 64 ELECTRODYNAMICS greater than that of light have-as in our previous results- no possibility of existence. This expression for the kinetic energy must also, by virtue of the argument stated above, apply to ponderable masses as well. We will now enumerate the properties of the motion of the electron which result from the system of equations (A), and are accessible to experiment. 1. From the second equation of the system (A) it follows that an electric force Y a.nd a magnetic force N have an equally strong deflective action on an electron moving with the velocity v, when Y = Nv/c. Thus we see that it is pos- sible by our theory to determine the velocity of the electron from the ratio of the magnetic power of deflexion Am to the electric power of deflexion Ae, for any velocity, by apply- ing the law Am v Ae = a· This relationship may be tested experimentally, since the velocity of the electron can be directly measured, e.g. by means of rapidly oscillating electric and magnetic fields. 2. From the deduction for the kinetic energy of the electron it follows that between the potential difference, P, traversed and the acquired velocity v of the electron there must be the relationship p = Jxax = ~c 2{--- _l __ - 1} E ..jl - v2/c2 3. We calculate the radius of curvature of the path of the electron when a magnetic force N is present (as the only deflective force), acting perpendicularly to the velocity of the electron. From the second of the equations (A) we obtain - a2y = !C = ~ ~N f 1 - !C dt2 R m c '4v c'J. or mc2 v/c 1 R = 7 · ..j(l -v 2/c2) • N' These three relationships are a complete expression for ELECTRODYNAMICS 65 the laws according to which, by the theory here advanced, the electron must move. In conclusion I wish to say that in working at the problem here dealt with I have had the loyal assistance of my friend and colleague M. Besso, and that I am indebted to him for several valuable suggestions. DOES THE INERTIA OF A BODY DEPEND UPON ITS ENERGY-CONTENT? BY A. EINSTEIN Translated from \"!st die Tragheit eines Korpers von seinem Energiegehalt abhii,ngig ?\" Annalen der Physik, 17, 1905. DOES THE INERTIA OF A BODY DEPEND UPON ITS ENERGY-CONTENT? BY A. EINSTEIN T HE results of the previous investigation lead to a very interesting conclusion, which is here to be deduced. I based that investigation on the Maxwell-Hertz equa- tions for empty space, together with the Maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space, and in addition the principle that :- The laws by which the states of physical systems alter are independent of the alternative, to which of two systems of co- ordinates, in uniform motion of parallel translation relatively to each other, these alterations of state are referred (principle of relativity). With these principles* as my basis I deduced inter alia the following result (§ 8) :- Let a system of plane waves of light, referred to the system of co-ordinates (x, y, z), possess the energy l; let the direction of the ray (the wave-normal) make an angle ff, with the a.xis of x of the system. If we introduce a new system of co-ordinates (E, 'TJ, t) moving in uniform parallel translation with respect to the system (x, y, z), and having its origin of co-ordinates in motion a.long the a.xis of x with the velocity v, then this quantity of light-measured in the system (E, '1/, O -possesses the energy v 1 - - cos q, l* = l c ,./1 - v2/c2 * The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is oi course contained in Maxwell's equations. 69 70 INERTIA. AND ENERGY where c denotes the velocity of light. We sba.11 ma.ke use of this result in what follows. Let there be a. sta.tiona.ry body in the system (x, y, z), a.nd let its energy-referred to the system (x, y, z)-be E 0• Let the energy of the body relative to the system (E, '1, n, moving a.s above with the velocity v, be H 0• Let this body send out, in a direction making a.n angle tf, with the axis of x, pla.ne waves of light, of energy iL mes.sured relatively to (x, y, z), and simultaneously an equal quantity of light in the opposite direction. Meanwhile the body remains at rest with respect to the system (x, y, z). The principle of energy must apply to this process, a.nd in fact (by the principle of relativity) with respect to both systems of co-ordinates. If we ca.11 the energy of the body a.fter the emission of light E 1 or H 1 respectively, mes.sured relatively to the system (x, y, z) or (E, 71, n respectively, then by employ- ing the relation given a.hove we obtain E 0 = E 1 + tL + tL, v v 1 - - COB tf, 1 + - COB tf, Ho = H1 + tL c + tL-----,,=c====:=;=:- ../1 - v2/c2 ../1 - v2/c2 L = H1 + ../1 - v2/c2' By subtraction we obta.in from these equations H 0 - E 0 - (H1 - E 1) = L{..;1 ~ v2/c2 - 1 }. The two differences of the form H - E occurring in this ex- pression ha.ve simple physics.I significations. H and E a.re energy values of the sa.me body referred to two systems of co-ordinates which are in motion relatively to each other, the body being a.t rest in one of the two systems (system (x, y, z)). Thus it is clear tha.t the difference H - E can differ from the kinetic energy K of the body, with respect to the other system (~, 71, ~. only by a.n additive constant C, which de- pends on the choice of the arbitrary additive constants of the energies H and E. Thus we may pla.ce A. EINSTElN H 0 - E 0 =Ko+ C, H1 - E1 = K1 + C, 71 since C does not change during the emission of light. So we have Ko - K1 = L{v'l = v2/c2 - 1 }· The kinetic energy of the body with respect to (E, '1/, t) diminishes as a result of the emission of light, and the amount of diminution is independent of the properties of the body. Moreover, the difference K 0 - K1, like the kinetic energy of the electron (§ 10), depends on the velocity. Neglecting magnitudes of fourth and higher orders we may place From this equation it directly follows that:- If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c2• The fact that the energy with- drawn from the body becomes energy of radiation evidently makes no difference, so that we are led to the more general conclusion that The mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content ; if the energy changes by L, the mass changes in the same sense by L/9 x 1020, the energy being measured in ergs, and the mass in grammes. It is not impossible that with bodies whose energy-con- tent is variable to a high degree (e.g. with radium salts) the theory may be successfully put to the test. If the theory corresponds to the facts, radiation conveys inertia between the emitting and absorbing bodies. SP ACE AND TIME BY H. MINKOWSKI .A. Translation of an .Address delivered at the 80th Assembly of German Natura.l Scientists and Physicians, at Cologne, 21 September, 1908. SPACE AND TIME BY H. MINKOWSKI T HE views of space and time which I wish to lay be- fore you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality. I First of all I should like to show how it might be possible, setting out from the accepted mechanics of the present day, a.long a, purely mathematical line of thought, to arrive at changed ideas of space and time. The equations of Newton's mechanics exhibit a two-fold invariance. Their form re- mains unaltered, firstly, if we subject the underlying system of spatial co-ordinates to any arbitrary change of position; secondly, if we change its state of motion, namely, by impart- ing to it any uniform translatory motion; furthermore, the zero point of time is given no part to play. We are ac- customed to look upon the axioms of geometry as finished with, when we feel ripe for the axioms of mechanics, and for that reason the two invariances are probably rarely mentioned in the same breath. Each of them by itself signifies, for the differential equations of mechanics, a certain group of trans- formations. The existence of the first group is looked upon as a fundamental characteristic of space. The second group is preferably treated with disdain, so that we with un- troubled minds may overcome the difficulty of never being able to decide, from physical phenomena, whether space, which is supposed to be stationary, may not be after all in a 75 76 SP ACE AND TIME sta.te of uniform tra.nslation. Thus the two groups, side by side, lead their lives entirely apart. Their utterly heterogeneous character may have discouraged any attempt to compound them. But it is precisely when they are compounded that the complete group, as a whole, gives us to think. We will try to visualize the state of things by the graphic method. Let :x, y, z be rectangular co-ordinates for space, and let t denote time. The objects of our perception invari- ably include places and times in combination. Nobody has ever noticed a place except at a time, or a time except at a place. But I still respect the dogma that both space and time have independent significance. A point of space at a point of time, that is, a system of values x, y, z, t, I will call a world-point. The multiplicity of all thinkable x, y, z, t systems of values we will christen the world. With this most valiant piece of chalk I might project upon the blackboard four world-axes. Since merely one chalky axis, as it is, con- sists of molecules all a-thrill, and moreover is taking part in the earth's travels in the universe, it already affords us ample scope for abstraction ; the somewhat greater abstraction as- sociated with the number four is for the mathematician no infliction. Not to leave a yawning void anywhere, we will imagine that everywhere and everywhen there is something perceptible. To avoid saying \" matter \" or \" electricity \" I will use for this something the word \" substance.\" We fix our attention on the substa;ntial point which is at the world- point x, y, z, t, a.nd imagine that we are able to recognize this substantial point at any other time. Let the variations d:x, dy, dz of the space co-ordinates of this substantial point correspond to a, time element dt. Then we obtain, as an image, so to speak, of the everlasting career of the sub- , stantial point, a curve in the world, a world-line, the points of which can be referred unequivocally to the parameter t from - oo to + oo. The whole universe is seen to resolve itself into similar world-lines, and I would fain anticipate myself by saying that in my opinion physical laws might find their most perfect expression as reciprocal relations between these world-lines. The concepts, space and time, cause the :x, y, z-manifold t = 0 and its two sides t > 0 and t < 0 to fall asunder. If, H. MINKOWSKI 77 for simplicity, we retain the same zero point of space and time, the first-mentioned group signifies in mechanics that we may subject the axes of x, y, z at t = 0 to any rotation we choose about the origin, corresponding to the homogeneous linear transformations of the expression x2 + y2 + z2. But the second group means that we may-also without changing the expression of the laws of mechanics-replace x, y, z, t by x - at, y - flt, z - ryt, t with any constant values of a, f), 'Y· Hence we may give to the time a.xis whatever direction we choose towards the upper half of the world, t > 0. Now what has the requirement of orthogonality in space to do with this perfect freedom of the time a.xis in an upward direction? To establish the connexion, let us take a positive para.- meter c, and consider the graphical representation of 02t2 _ xz _ y2 _ z2 = 1. It consists of two surfaces separated by t = 0, on the analogy of a hyperboloid of two sheets. We consider the sheet in the region t > 0, and now take those homogeneous linear transformations of x, y, z, t into four new variables x', y', z', t', for which the expression for this sheet in the new variables is of the same form. It is evident that the rotations of space a.bout the origin pertain to these transformations. Thus we gain full comprehension of the rest of the transformations simply by ta.king into consideration one among them, such that y and z remain unchanged. We draw (Fig. 1) the section of this sheet by the plane of the axes of x and t-the upper branch of the hyperbola. c2t2 - x2 = 1, with its asymptotes. From the origin O we draw any radius vector OA' of this branch of the hyperbola; draw the tangent to the hyperbola. at A' to cut the asymptote on the right at B'; complete the parallelogram OA'B'C';, and finally, for subse- quent use, produce B'C' to cut the a.xis of x at D'. Now if we take OC' and OA' as axes of oblique co-ordinates x', t', with the measures OC' = 1, OA' = 1/c, then that branch of the hyperbola. again acquires the expression c2t'2 - x'2 = 1, t' > 0, and the transition from z, y, z, t to x', y', z', t' is one of 78 SP ACE AND TIME the transformations in question. With these transformations we now associate the arbitrary displacements of the zero point of space and time, and thereby constitute a group of transformations, which is also, evidently, dependent on the parameter c. This group I denote by Ge. If we now allow c to increase to infinity, and 1/c therefore to converge towards zero, we see from the figure that the p' p• \"' -\"' p p FIG. 1. branch of the hyperbola bends more and more towards the axis of x, the angle of the asymptotes becomes more and more obtuse, and that in the limit this special transformation changes into one in which the axis of t' may have any up- ward direction whatever, while:.,;' approaches more and more exactly to x. In view of this it is clear that group Ge in the limit when c = oo, that is the group G00 , becomes no other than that complete group which is appropriate to Newtonian H. MINKOWSKI 79 mechanics. This being so, and since Ge is mathematically more intelligible than G00 , it looks as though the thought might have struck some mathematician, fancy-free, that after all, as a matter of fact, natural phenomena do not possess an invariance with the group G00 , but rather with a group Ge, c being finite and detet:minate, but in ordinary units of measure, extremely great. Such a premonition would have been an extraordinary triumph for pure mathematics. Well, mathe- matics, though it now can display only staircase-wit, has the satisfaction of being wise after the event, and is able, thanks to its happy antecedents, with its senses sharpened by an un- hampered outlook to far horizons, to grasp forthwith the far-reaching consequences of such a metamorphosis of our concept of nature. I will state a.t once what is the value of c with which we shall finally be dealing. It is the velocity of the propagation of light in empty space. To avoid speaking either of space or of emptiness, we may define this magnitude in another way, as the ratio of the electromagnetic to the electrostatic unit of electricity. The existence of the invariance of natural laws for the relevant group Ge would have to be ta.ken, then, in this way:- From the totality of natural phenomena it is possible, by successively enhanced approximations, to derive more and more exactly a system of reference x, y, z, t, space and time, by means of which these phenomena then present themselves in agreement with definite laws. But when this is done, this system of reference is by no means unequivocally deter- mined by the phenomena. It is still possible to make any change in the system of reference that is in conformity with the transformations of the group Ge, and leave the expression of the laws of nature unaltered. For example, in correspondence with the figure described above, we may also designate time t', but then must of neces- sity, in connexion therewith, define space by the manifold of the three parameters x', y, z, in which case physical laws would be expressed in exactly the same way by means of x', y, z, t' as by means of x, y, z, t. We should then have in the world no longer space, but an infinite number of spaces, 80 SP ACE AND TIME analogously as there are in three-dimensional space an infinite number of planes. Three-dimensional geometry becomes a chapter in four-dimensional physics. Now you know why I said at the outset that space and time are to fade away into shadows, and only a world in itself will subsist. II The question now is, what are the circumstances which force this changed conception of space and time upon us ? Does it actually never contradict experience? And ftp.ally, is it advantageous for describing phenomena? BEl,fore going into these questions, I must make an im- portant remark. If we have in any way individualized space and time, we have, as a world-line corresponding to a stationary substantial point, a straight line parallel to the a.xis of t; corresponding to a substantial point in uniform motion, a straight line at an angle to the axis of t; to a substantial point in varying motion, a world-lirie in some form of a curve. If at any world-point x, y, z, t we take the world-line passing through that point, and find it parallel to any radius vector OA' of the above-mentioned hyperboloidal sheet, we can introduce OA' as a new axis of time, and with the new con- cepts of space and time thus given, the substance at the world-point concerned appears as at rest. ' We will now intro- duce this fundamental axiom :- The substance at any world-point may always, with the aJYPropriate determination of space and time, be looked upon as at rest. The axiom signifies that at any world-point the expression c2dt2 - dx2 - dy2 - dz2 always has a positive value, or, what comes to the same thing, that any velocity v always proves less than c. Accordingly c would stand as the upper limit for all substantial velocities, and that is precisely what would reveal the deeper significance of the magnitude c. In this second form the first impression made by the axiom is not altogether pleasing. But we must bear in mind that a modified form of mechanics, in whi'ch the square root of this quadratic differential expression appears, H. MINKOWSKI 81 will now make its way, so that cases with a. velocity greater than that of light will henceforward play only some such pa.rt a.s that of figures with imaginary co-ordinates in geometry. Now the impulse and true motive for assuming the group Ge came from the fact that the differential equation for the propagation of light in empty space possesses that group Ge,• On. the other hand, the concept of rigid bodies ha.s meaning only in mechanics satisfying the group G00 • If we have a. theory of optics with Ge, and if on the other hand there were rigid bodies, it is easy to see that one and the same direction of t would be distinguished by the two hyperboloidal sheets appropriate to Ge a.nd G00 , a.nd this would have the further consequence, that we should be able, by employing suitable rigid optical instruments in the laboratory, to perceive some a.Iteration in the phenomena when the orientation with re- spect to the direction of the earth's motion is changed. But all efforts directed towards this goal, in particular the famous interference experiment of Michelson, have had a. negative result. To explain this failure, H. A. Lorentz set up a.n hypo- thesis, the success of which lies in this very invariance in optics for the group Ge. According to Lorentz any moving body must have undergone a. contraction in the direction of its motion, and in fa.ct with a. velocity v, a. contraction in the ratio 1: ,../1 - v2/c2 • This hypothesis sounds extremely fa.ntastical, for the con- traction is not to be looked upon as a consequence of resist- ances in the ether, or anything of that kind, but simply as a. gift from a.bove,-as an accompanying circumstance of the circumstance of motion. I will now show by our figure that the Lorentzian hypothesis is completely equivalent to the new conception of space a.nd time, which, indeed, makes the hypothesis much more intelli- gible. If for simplicity we disregard y and z, and imagine a world of one spatial dimension, then a. parallel band, upright like the a.xis of t, and another inclining to the a.xis of t (see Fig. 1) * An e.pplice.tion of this fa.ct in its essentie.ls he.s a.lrea.dy been given by W. Voigt, Gotoinger Ne.chrichten, 1887, p. 41. 82 SP ACE AND TIME represent, respectively, the career of a body at rest or in uni- form motion, preserving in each case a constant spatial extent. If OA' is parallel to the second band, we can introduce t' as the time, and x' as the space co-ordinate, and then the second body appears at rest, the first in uniform motion. We now assume that the first body, envisaged as at rest, has the length l, that is, the cross section PP of the first band on the axis of x is equal to l . OC, where OC denotes the unit of measure on the axis of x ; and on the other hand, that the second body, envisaged as at rest, has the same length l, which then means that the cross section Q'Q' of the second band, measured parallel to the axis of x', is equal to l. OC'. We now have in these two bodies images of two equal Lorentzian electrons, one at rest and one in uniform motion. But if we retain the original co-ordinates x, t, we must give as the extent of the second electron the cross section of its appropriate band parallel to the axis of x. Now since Q'Q' = l. OC', it is evident that QQ = l. OD'. If dx/dt for the second band is equal to v, an easy calculation gives OD' = OC../1 - v2/c2, therefore also PP: QQ = 1: ../1 - v2/c2• But this is the meaning of Lorentz's hypothesis of the contraction of electrons in motion. If on the other hand we envisage the second electron as at rest, and therefore adopt the system of reference x' t', the length of the first must be denoted by the cross section P'P' of its band parallel to OC', and we should find the first electron in comparison with the second to be contracted in exactly the same proportion; for in the figure P'P': Q'Q' = OD : QC' = OD' : QC = QQ : PP. Lorentz called the t' combination of x and t the local time of the electron in uniform motion, and applied a physical construction of this concept, for the better understanding of the hypothesis of contraction. But the credit of first recog- nizing clearly that the time of the one electron is just as good as that of the other, that is to say, that t and t' are to be treated identically, belongs to A. Einstein.* Thus time, as a * A. Einst.ein, Ann. d. Phys., 17, 1905, p. 891; Ja.hrb. d. Ra.dioa.ktivitat und Elektronik, 4, 1907, p. 411. H. l\\iIINKOWSKI 83 concept unequivocally determined by phenomena, was first deposed from its high seat. Neither Einstein nor Lorentz ma.de any attack on the concept of space, perhaps because in the above-mentioned special transformation, where the plane of x', t' coincides with the plane of x, t, an interpretation is possible by saying that the x-axis of space maintains its position. One may expect to find a corresponding violation of the concept of space appraised as another act of audacity on the part of the higher mathematics. Nevertheless, this further step is indispensable for the true understanding of the group Ge, and when it has been taken, the word relativity- postulate for the requirement of an invariance with the group Ge seems to me very feeble. Since the postulate comes to mean that only the four-dimensional world in space and time is given by phenomena, but that the projection in space and in time may still be undertaken with a certain degree of freedom, I prefer to call it the postulate of the absolute world (or briefly, the world-postulate). III The world-postulate permits identical treatment of the four co-ordinates x, y, z, t. By this means, as I shall now show, the forms in which the laws of physics are displayed gain in intelligibility. In particular the idea of acceleration acquires a clear-cut character. I will use a geometrical manner of expression, which sug- gests itself at once if we tacitly disregard z in the triplex x, y, z. I take any world-point O as the zero-point of space- time. The cone c2t2 - a:2 - y 2 - z2 = 0 with apex O (Fig. 2) consists of two parts, one with values t < 0, the other with values t > 0. The former, the front cone of 0, consists, let us say, of all the world-points which \" send light to O,\" the latter, the back cone of 0, of all the world-points which \" re- ceive light from O.\" The territory bounded by the front cone alone, we may call \"before\" 0, that which is bounded by the back cone alone, \" after\" 0. The hyperboloidal sheet already discussed F = c2t2 - x 2 - y 2 - z2 = 1, t > O lies after 0. The territory between the cones is filled by the 84 SP ACE AND TIME one-sheeted hyperboloidal figures _ F = x2 + y2 + z2 _ 02t2 = ks for all constant positive values of k. We are specially interested in the hyperbolas with O as centre, lying on the latter figures. The single branches of these hyperbolas may be called briefly the internal hyperbolas with centre 0. One of these branches, regarded as a world-line, would repre- sent a motion which, for t = - oo and t = + oo , rises asymptotically to the velocity of light, c. If we now, on the analogy of vectors in space, call a directed length in the manifold of x, y, z, ta vector,. we have to distinguish between the time-like vectors with directions from O to the sheet + F = 1, t > 0, and the space-like vectors Fm. 2. with directions from O to - F = 1. The time axis may run parallel to any vector of the former kind. Any world-point between the front and back cones of O can be arranged by means of the system of reference so as to be simultaneous with 0, but also just as well so as to be earlier than O or later than 0. Any world-point within the front cone of O is necessarily always before O ; any world-point within the back cone of O necessarily always after 0. Corresponding to passing to the limit, c = oo , there would be a complete flatten- ing out of the wedge-shaped segment between the cones into the plane manifold t = 0. In the figures this segment is intentionally drawn with different widths. We divide up any vector we choose, e.g. that from O to :i:, y, z, t, into the four components x, y, z, t. If the directions H. MINKOWSKI 85 of two vectors are, respectively, that of a radius vector OR from O to one of the surfaces + F = 1, and that of a, tangent RS at the point R of the same surface, the vectors are sa.id to be normal to one another. Thus the condition that the vectors with components x, y, z, t a.nd x1, y1, z1, ti may be normal to each other is c2tt1 - xx1 - yy1 - zz1 = 0. For the measurement of vectors in different directions the units of measure are to be fixed by assigning to .a. space-like vector from O to - F = 1 always the magnitude 1, and to a time-like vector from O to + F = 1, t > 0 always the magni- tude 1/c. If we imagine at a. world-point P (x, y, z, t) the world- line of a. substantial point running through that point, the magnitude corresponding to the time-like vector dx, dy, dz, dt laid off along the line is therefore dT = ! ../ ctdt2 - dx2 - dy 2 - dz 2. c Ttle integral ~dT = T of this amount, ta.ken along the world- line from any fixed starting-point P O to the variable end- point P, we call the proper time of the substantial point a.t P. On the world-line we regard x, y, z, t-the components of the vector OP-as functions of the proper time T; denote their first differential coefficients with respect to T by x, ff, z, i; their second differential coefficients with respect to T by ii, y, z, l; and give names to the appropriate vectors, calling the derivative of the vector OP with respect to T the velocity vector at P, and the derivative of this velocity vector with respect fo T the acceleration vector at P. Hence, since c2[2 _ :i;2 _ y2 _ z2 = c2, we have c2i't - xx - yy - zz = 0, i.e. the velocity vector is the time-like vector of unit magni- tude in the direction of the world-line at P, and the accelera- tion vector at P is normal to the velocity vector at P, and is therefore in any ca.se a. space-like vector. Now, as is readily seen, there is a. definite hyperbola. 86 SPACE AND TIME which has three infinitely proximate points in common with the world-line at P, and whose asymptotes are generators of . • • I ,, , , I' I' I • \\ .

Let this hyperbola be ca.He'd the hyperbola. of curvature at P. If Mis the centre of this hyperbola, wa here ha.ve to do with an in- terns.I hyperbola. with centre M. Let p be the magnitude of the vector MP ; then we recognize the acceleration vector a.t P a.s the vector in the direction MP of magnitude c2/p. If x, y, z, t are a.II zero, the hyperbola of curvature reduces to the straight line touch- ing the world-line in P, a.nd we must put p = 00. IV To show that the assumption of group FIG. 8. Ge for the laws of physics never leads to a contradiction, it is unavoidable to undertake a revision of the whole of physics on the basis of this assumption. This revision ha.s to some extent already been successfully carried out for questions of thermodynamics and hea.t radiation,* for electromagnetic processes, and finally, with the retention of the concept of mass, for mechanics. t For this last branch of physics it is of prime importance to ra.ise the question-When a force with the components X, Y, Z parallel to the axes of space a.eta at a ~orld-point P (x, y, z, t), where the velocity vector is x, y, t, t, what must we take this force to be when the system of reference is in any way changed ? Now there exist certain approved sta.te- ments as to the ponderomotive force in the electroma.gnetic field in the cases where the group Ge is undoubtedly admis- sible. These statements lea.d up to the simple rule :-When the system of reference is changed, the force in question transforms into a force in the new space co-ordinates in such a wa.y that the appropriate vector with the components iX, * M.

T = - ~x + ~Y + ~z) c2 t t t is the rate at which work is done by the force at the world- point divided by c, remains unchanged. This vector is always normal to the velocity vector at P. A force vector of this kind, corresponding to a force at P, is to be called a \"motive force vector\" at P. I shall now describe the world-line of a. substantial point with constant mechanical mass m, passing through P. Let the velocity vector at P, multiplied by m, be called the \" momentum vector\" at P, and the acceleration vector at P, multiplied by m, be called the \" force vector\" of the motion at P. With these definitions, the law of motion of a. point of mass with given motive force vector runs thus :- * The Force Vector of Motion is Equal to the Motive Force Vector. This assertion comprises four equations for the components corresponding to the four axes, and since both vectors men- tioned are a priori normal to the velocity vector, the fourth equation may be looked upon as a consequence of the other three. In accordance with the above signification of T, the fourth equation undoubtedly represents the law of energy. Therefore the component of the momentum vector along the axis of t, multiplied by c, is to be defined as the kinetic energy of the point mass. The expression for this is mc2q,J = mc2/ 11 - v2/c2 dT ..., ' i.e., after removal of the additive constant mc2, the expression -!mv2 of Newtonian mechanics down to magnitudes of the order 1/c2• It comes out very clearly in this way, how the energy depends on the system of reference. But as the a.xis of t may be laid in the direction of any time-like vector, the law of energy, framed for all possible systems of reference, already contains, on the other hand, the whole system of the equations of motion. At the limiting transition which we have discussed, to c = oo, this fact retains its importance for * H. Minkowski, loo. cit., p 107. Cf. also M. Planck, Verhe.ndlunge.n der physike.lisohen Gesellsche.ft, 4, 1906, p. 186. 88 SP ACE AND TIME the axiomatic structure of Newtonian mechanics as well, and has already been appreciated in this sense by I. R. Schlitz.* We can determine the ratio of the units of length and time beforehand in such a way that the natural limit of velocity becomes c = 1. If we then introduce, further, ~--::-f t = s in place of t, the quadratic differential ex- pression di' = - dx2 - dy 2 - dz 2 - ds2 thus becomes perfectly symmetrical in x, y, z, s; and this symmetry is communicated to any law which does not contra- dict the world-postulate. Thus the essence of this postulate may be clothed mathematically in a very pregnant manner in the mystic formula 3 . 105 km = \"-=-I secs. v The advantages afforded by the world-postulate will per- haps be most strikingly exemplified by indicating the effects proceeding from a point charge in any kind of motion accord- ing to the Maxwell-Lorentz theory. e, e Let us imagine the world-line of such a point electron with the charge e, and introduce upon it the proper time -r Y from any initial point. In order to find the field caused by the electron at any world-point P 1, we construct the front cone belonging to P 1 (Fig. 4). The cone evidently meets the world-line, since the directions of the line a.re evefywhere those of time-like vectors, at the single point P. We draw the tangent to the world-line at P, and construct through FIG. 4. P 1 the normal P 1Q to this tangent. Let the length of P 1Q be r. Then, by the definition of a front cone, the length of PQ must be r/c. Now the vector in the direction PQ of magnitude e/r repre- \"I. R.

MINKOWSKI 89 sents by its components along the axes of x, y, z, the vector potential multiplied by c, and by the component along the axis of t, the scalar potential of the field excited by e at the world-point P. Herein lie the elementary laws formulated by A. Lienard and E. Wiechert.* Then in the description of the field produced by the electron we see that the separation of the field into electric and magnetic force is a relative one with regard to the under- lying time axis ; the most perspicuous way of describing the two forces together is on a certain analogy with the wrench in mechanics, though the analogy is not complete. I will now describe the ponderomotive action of a moving point charge on another moving point charge. Let us imagine the world-line of a second point electron of the charge' ei, passing through the world-point P 1• We define P, Q, r as before, then construct (Fig. ~ the centre M of the hyperbola of curvature at P, and finally the normal MN from M to a. stra.ight line imagined through P pa.rallel to QP1• With P a.s sta.rting-point we now determine a system of reference a.s follows :-The axis of t in the direction PQ, the axis of x in direction QPi, the a.xis of y in direction MN, whereby finally the direction of the axis of z is also defined as normal to the axes of t, x, y. Let the acceleration vector at P be x, y, z, t, the velocity vector a.t P 1 be x1, fh, z1, t1• The motive force vector exerted at P 1 by the first moving electron e on the second moving electron e1 now takes the form - ee1(t1 - ~)S?, where the components S?a:, $?11, S?z, S?t of the vector S? satisfy the three rela.tions cS?t - S?a: = .!.2 , S?y = ~ , S?z = 0, r c·r and where, fourthly, this vector S? is normal to the velocity vector at Pi, and through this circumstance alone stands in dependence on the latter velocity vector. * A.

In mechanics a.s reformed in accordance with the world- postulate, the disturbing lack of harmony between Newtonian mechanics and modern electrodynamics disappears of its own a.ccord. Before CO!).cluding I will just touch upon the attitude of Newton's law of attraction toward this postulate.

In the development of its mathematical consequences there will be ample suggestions for experimental verifications of the postulate, which will suffice to conciliate even those to whom the abandonment of old-established. views is unsympathetic or painful, by the idea of a pre-established harmony between pure mathematics and physics. NOTES by A. SOMMERFELD The following notes a.re given in an appendix so as to interfere in no way with Minkowski's text. They are by no means essential, having no other pur- pose than that of removing certain small formal ma.thema.tica.l difficulties which might hinder the comprehension of Minkowski's great thoughts. The bibliographical references a.re confined to the literature dee.ling expressly with the subject of his address. From the physical point of view there is nothing in what Minkowski says that must now be withdrawn, with the exception of the final remark on Newton's la.w of attraction. What will be the epistemo· logioa.l attitude towards Minkowski's conception of the time-space problem is another question, but, as it seems to me, a. question which does not essentially touch his physics. (1) Page 81, line 8. \" On the other hand, the concept of rigid bodies has meaning only in mechanics satisfying the group 0 00 .\" This sentence was con- firmed in the widest sense in a. discussion on a paper by his disciple M. Bom, a year after Minkowski's dee.th. Born (Ann. d. Physik, 80, 1909, p. 1) had defined a relatively rigid body a.s one in which every element of volume, even in a.ccelera.ted motions, undergoes the Lorentzian contraction appropriate to its velocity. Ehrenfest (Phys. Zeitschr.: 10, 1909, p. 918) showed that such a. body cannot be set in rotation ; Herglotz (Ann. d. Phys., 81, 1910, p. 898) and F. Nother (Ann. d. Phys., 81, 1910, p. 919) that it has only three degrees of freedom of movement. The attempt was also ma.de to define a. relatively rigid body with six or nine degrees of freedom. But Planck (Phys. Zeitschr., 11, 1910, p. 294) expressed the view that the theory of relativity can operate only with more or less elastic bodies, and Laue (Phys. Zeitschr., 12, 1911, p. 48), employing Minkowski's methods, and his Fig. 2 in the text a.hove, proved that in the theory of relativity every solid body must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Finally Herglotz (Ann. d. Physik, 86, 1911, p. 468) developed a. relativistic theory of elasticity, accord- ing to which elastic tensions always occur if the motion of the body is not rela- tively rigid in Born's sense. Thus the relatively rigid body pla.ys the same pa.rt in this theory of elasticity a.s the ordinary rigid body pla.ys in the ordina.ry theory of elasticity.

Laue (Phys. Zeitschr., 12, 1911, p. 48) traces to this observation the proof of Einstein's theorem : In the theory of relativity no process of causality can be props.gated with a velocity greater than that of light (\" Signal velocity ~ c \"). Assume that a.n event O ca.uses another event P, and that the world- point P lies in the region between the cones of 0, In this case the effect would have been conveyed from O to P with a. velocity greater than that of light, rela- tively to the system of reference-a:, t in question, in which, of course, the effect P is assumed to be later than the cause 0, tp > 0. But now, in accordance with the words quoted above, the system of reference may be changed, so that P comes to be earlier than 0, that is to say, a system re', t' may be chosen in 94 NOTES infinitely ma.ny we.ye so the.t t'p becomes <O. This is irreoonoile.ble with the idea. of oe.use.lity. P must therefore lie either \" e.fter\" 0 or on the be.ck cone of 0, i.e. the velocity of prope.go.tion of e. signal to be sent from O, which is to ca.use e. second event e.t the world-point P, must of necessity be ~c.

As Minkowski once remarked to me, the element of proper time a,,,. is not a complete differential. Thus if we connect two world- points O e.nd P by two different world-lines 1 e.nd 2, then If 1 runs pe.re.llel to the t-e.xis, so that the first; tra.mition in the chosen system of reference signifies rest, it is evident that On this depends the retardation of the moving clock compared with the clock at rest. The assertion is based, as Einstein has pointed out, on the unprov- able assumption that the clock in motion e.otue.lly indicates its own proper time, i.e. the.t it always gives the time corresponding to the state of velocity, regarded as constant, at e.ny instant. The moving clock must naturally have been moved with acceleration (with changes of speed or direction) in order to be compared with the stationary clock e.t the world-point P. The rete.rd- e.tion of the moving clock does not therefore e.otue.lly indicate \"motion,\" but \" accelerated motion.\" Hence this does not contra.diet the principle of relativity. (5) Page 86, line 4. The term \"hyperbole. o:C curvature\" is formed exe.otly on the model of the elementary concept of the circle of curvature. The analogy become e.ne.lyticQJ identity if instead of the real co-ordinate of time t the imaginary u = ict is employed, that is, c times the co-ordinate employed by Minkowski, page 88, line 6. By pe.ge 84 an inteme.l hyperbole. in the a:, t-ple.ne has the equation, with k= p, therefore in the a:, u ple.ne Hence it me.y be written in pa.re.metric form, when ~ denotes a purely imagin- ary angle, a: - p cos ~. u = p sin ~· A. SOMMERFELD 95 So, as I suggested in the Ann. d. Phys., 88, p. 649, § 8, hyperbolic motion may also be denoted as\" cyclic motion,\" whereby its chief properties (convection of the field, occurrence of a kind of centrifugal force) are che.raoterillled with particular cle11arness. For the hyr,erbolic motion we have and thus • dz . . . du . :x; = - = - 'IC sm </>, u = - = + w cos </> d.. a.,. .• dib c2 Z=-=-COB</> d.,. p • .. du c2 • 'II,=-= -BID</>, d't\" p The magnitude of the acceleration vector in hyperbolic motion is therefore c2/p. Since e.ny given world-line is touched by the hyperbola of curvature a.t three points, it has the ea.me acceleration vector as the hyperbolic motion, and its magnitude is c2/p, as indicated on page 86, line 11. The centre M of \"the cyclic motion z2 + 11,2 = p2 is evidently the point a: = O, u = 0, and from this centre all points of the hyperbola have the con- stant \" distance,\" i.e. a. constant magnitude of the radius vector. Therefore p denotes the interval marked MP in Fig. 8. (6) Page 87, line 1. A force X, Y, Z, to be made into a \"force vector,\" must be multiplied by i = dt/d.,., This me.y be explained as follows. According to Minkowski, pa.ge 87, line 10, the momentum vector is defined b:f ma:, miJ, mi, mt, where m denotes the \" constant mechanical mass,\" or, a.s Minkowski says m~re plainly elsewhere, the \" rest ma.ss.\" If we retain Newton's law of motion (time rate of change of momentum equa.l to force), we ha.veto set ~(ma:) = X, ~(my) = Y, ~(mii) = Z. Multiplication by l makes the left-hand sides into vector components in Minkowski's sense. Therefore ix, ZY, tz are also the first three components of the \"force vector.\" The fourth component T follows without ambiguity from the requirement that the force vector is to be normal to the motion vector. Minkowski's equations for the mechanics of the mass point are there- fore, with constant rest ma.as, mii = iX, my = tY, mi = iz, mt = tT. The assumption of constancy of rest mass can only be maintained, however, when the energy-content of the body is not changed in its motion, or in the words of Planck, when the motion ensues \" adiabatically and isochorica.lly.\" (7) Pe.gee 88 and 89. What is cha.ra.oteristio of the constructions here given, is their complete independence of any special system of reference. They give, a.s Minkowski postulates on page 88, \"reciprocal relations between world-lines\" (or world-points) as\" the most perfect expression of physical laws.\" On page 89, for example, the electrodynamic potentia.l (four-potential) is not referred to the a.xes of co-ordinates a,, 11, 11, t until it is to be conventionally divided into a scalar a.nd a vector portion, which have no independent invariant meaning from the relativistic standpoint. By way of commentary to Minkowski l have deduced, from Maxwell's 96 NOTES equations, by Minkowski's methods, an invariant ane.Iytica.l form for the four- potentia.l and the ponderomotive action between two electrons, and so given another view of these constructions of Minkowski. Instead of going into de- tails hel'e, I may refer to my article in Ann. d. Phys., 33, 1910, p. 649, § 7, or to M. Laue, \" Das Rela.tivitii.tsprinzip,\" Braunschweig, Vieweg, 1918, § 19. Compal'e also Minkowski's address on the principle of relativity, edited by my- self, in Ann. d. Phys., 47, 1915, p. 927, where the four-potential is placed a.t the hea.d of electrodynamics, a.nd this theory thus reduced to its simplest form. (8) Page 89, line 6. The invariant representation of the electromagnetic field by a \"vector of the second kind\" (or, as I proposed to call it, a \" six-vector,\" a term which seems to be winning acceptance) is a. particularly important pa.rt of Minkowski's view of electrodynamics. Whereas Minkowski's ideas on the vector of the first kind, or four-vector, were in pal't anticipated by Poinca.re (Rend. Ciro. Me.t. Palermo, 21, 1906), the introduction of the six-vector is new. Like the six-vector, the wrench of mechanics (standing for a. single force and a couple) depends on six independent pa.re.meters. And a.s in the electro- magnetic field \" the sepa.ra.tion into electric a.nd magnetic force is a relative one,\" so with the wrench, a.s is well known, the division into single force and couple can be ma.de in very many ways. (9) Page 90, line 9. Minkowski's rela.tivistic form of Newton's law for the specie.I ca.se of zero a.ccelera.tion mentioned in the text is included in the more genera.I form proposed by Poinca.re (loo. cit.). On the other hand, in ta.king a.c- celera.tion into consideration, it goes further tha.n the latter. Minkowski's or Poinca.re's formulation of the la.w of gra.vita.tion shows tha.t it is possible in ma.ny wa.ys to reconcile Newton's Ja.w with the theory of relativity. That la.w is viewed a.s e. point la.w, a.nd gravitation therefore in a. certain sense a.s action a.t a. distance. The genera.I theory of relativity, which Einstein ha.s been developing from 1907 on, gets a. deeper grip of the problem of gravitation. Gravitation is not only regarded a.s a field action and described by space-time differential equations-which seems from the present standpoint irrefuta.ble- but it is a.lso united organically with the principle of relativity extended to any transformations, whereas Minkowski a.nd Poinca.re had adapted it to the postu. la.te of rela.ti vity in a more external manner. In the genera.I theory of relativity the space-time structure is determined, from or together with, gravitation. Thus the principle of relativity, by an extension of Minkowski's idea.a, is so formu- lated tha.t it postulates the co-variance of physical quantities with reference to all point transformations, so that the coefficients of the invariant linear element enter into the la.ws of physics.

ON THE INI?LUENCE OF GRAVITA'fION ON THE PROPAGA'flON OF LIGHT BY A. EINSTEIN Translated from \" tJber den Einfluss der Schwerkraf t au/ die Ausbreitung des Lichtes,\" Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. ON THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATION ON THE PROPAGATION OF LIGHT BY A. EINSTEIN I N a. memoir published four yea.rs a.go * I tried to answer the question whether the propagation of light is in- fluenced by gravitation. I return to this theme, bees.use my previous presentation of the subject does not satisfy me, a.nd for a stronger res.son, because I now see that one of the most important consequences of my former treatment is capable of being tested experimentally. For it follows from the theory here to be brought forward, that rays of light, passing close to the sun, are deflected by its gravita- tional field, so that the angular distance between the sun and a. fixed star appearing near to it is apparently increased by nearly a second of arc. In the course of these reflexions further results are yielded which relate to gravitation. But as the exposition of the entire group of considerations wou1d be rather difficult to follow, only a few quite elementary reflexions will be given in the following pages, from which the reader will readily be a.ble to inform himself a.s to the suppositions of the theory and its line of thought. The relations here deduced, even if the theoretical foundation is sound, are vs.lid only to a first approximation. § 1. A Hypothesis as to the Physical Nature of the Gravitational Field In a homogeneous gravitational field (acceleration of gravity ry) let there be a. str,tionary system of co-ordinates K, orientated so that the lines of force of the gravitational field run in the negative direction of the a.xis of z. In a. space free *A.Einstein, J\"ahrbuch flir Radioakt. und Elektronik, 4'1 1907, 99 100 GRAVITATION AND LIGHT of gravitational fields let there be a second system of co- ordinates K', moving with uniform acceleration (\"/) in the positive direction of its axis of z. To avoid unnecessary com- plications, let us for the present disregard the theory of relativity, and regard both systems from the customary point of view of kinematics, and the movements occurring in them from that of ordinary mechanics. Relatively to K, as well as relatively to K', material points which are not subjected to the action of other material points, move in keeping with the equations d2x d2y d2z dt 2 = o, dt 2 = o, dt2 = - \"I· For the accelerated system K' this follows directly from Galileo's principle, but for the system K, at rest in a homo- geneous gravitational field, from the experience that all bodies in such a field are equally and uniformly accelerated. This experience, of the equal falling of all bodies in the gravi- tational field, is one of the most universal which the obser- vation of nature has yielded; but in spite of that the law has not found any place in the foundations of our edifice of the physical universe. But we arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems Kand K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated. This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute accelera- tion of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system; * and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course. As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical pro- cesses in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we a.re certain of the equivalence of the systems Kand K'. * Of course we cannot repla.ce a.ny a.rbitra.ry gra.vita.tiona.J field by a. sta.te of motion of the system without a. gra.vita.tiona.l field, a.ny more tha.n, by a. tra.ns- forma.tion of relativity, we ca.n transform all points of a. medium in any kind of motion to rest. A. EINSTEIN 101 Bnt this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'. By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance. For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homo- geneous gravitational field. We shall now show, first of all, from the standpoint of the 9rdinary theory of relativity, what degree of probability is inherent in our hypothesis. § 2. On the Gravitation of Energy One result yielded by the theory of relativity is that the inertia mass of a body increases with the energy it contains; if the increase of energy amounts to E, the increase in inertia mass is equal to E/c2, when c denotes the velocity of light. Now is there an increase of gravitating mass corresponding to this increase of inertia mass ? If not, then a body would fall in the same gravitational field with varying acceleration according to the energy it contained. That highly satisfactory result of the theory of relativity by which the law of the con- servation of mass is merged in the law of conservation of energy could not be maintained, because it would compel us to abandon the law of the conservation of mass in its old form for inertia mass, and maintain it for gravitating mass. But this must be regarded as very improbable. On the other hand, the usual theory of relativity does not provide us with any argument from which to infer that the weight of a body depends on the energy contained in it. But we shall show that our hypothesis of the equivalence of the systems K and K' gives us gravitation of energy as a necessary con- sequence. Let the two material systems 81 and 82,provided withinstru- ments of measurement, be situated on the z-axis of K at the distance h from each other,* so that the gravitation potential in 82 is greater than that in 81 by ryk. Let a definite quantity * The dimensions of 8 1 and 8 2 are regarded as infinitely small in compari- son with h. 102 GRAVITATION AND LIGHT of energy Ebe emitted from 82 towards 81• Let the quantities of energy in 81 and 82 be measured by contrivances which- brought to one place in the system z and there compared- shall be perfectly alike. As to the process of this conveyance of energy by radiation we can make no a priori assertion, be- cause we do not know the influence of the gravitati~nal field on the radiation and the measuring instruments in 81 and 82 • But by our postulate of the equivalence of K and K' we are able, in place of the system Kin a homogeneous gravi- tational field, to set -the gravitation-free system K', which moves with uniform acceleration in the direction of positive z, and with the z-axis of which the material systems 81 and 8 2 are rigidly connected. h We judge of the process of the transference of energy by z FIG. 5. radiation from 82 to 81 from a system K 0, which is to be free from acceleration. At the moment when the radiation energy E 1 is emitted from 82 toward 81, let the velocity of K' relatively to K 0 be zero. The radiation will arrive at 81 when the time h/c has elapsed (to a first approxi- mation). But at this moment the velo- y city of 81 relatively to K 0 is ryh/c = v. Therefore by the ordinary theory of re- lativity the radiation arriving at 81 does :X: not possess the energy E 2, but a greater energy E 1, which is related to E 2 to a first approximation by the equation * E 1 = E2(l + ~) = E 2(1 + ry;) (1) By our assumption exactly the same relation holds if the same process takes place in the system K, which is not acceler- ated, but is provided with a gravitational field. In this case we may replace ryh by the potential <I> of the gravitation vector in 82, if the arbitrary constant of <I> in 81 is equated to zero. We then have the equation E 1 = E 2 + E2 2<1> • (la) c * See above, pp. 69-71. A. EINSTEIN 103 This equation expresses the law of energy for the process under observation. The energy E 1 arriving at 81 is greater than the energy E 11, measured by the same means, which was emitted in 82, the excess being the potential energy of the mass E 2/c2 in the gravitational field. It thus proves that for the fulfilment of the principle of energy we have to ascribe to the energy E, before its emission in 82, a potential energy due to gravity, which corresponds to the gravitational mass E/c2. Our assumption of the equivalence of K and K' thus removes the difficulty mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph which is left unsolved by the ordinary theory of relativity. The meaning of this result is shown particularly clearly if we com~ider the following cycle of. operations :- 1. The energy E, as measured in 8 2, is emitted in the form of radiation in 82 towards 8 1, where, by the result just ob- tained, the energy E(l + .,.,h/c2), as measured in 81, is ab- sorbed. 2. A body W of mass M is lowered from 82 to 81, work M,yh being done in the process. 3. The energy E is transferred from 81 to the body W while Wis in Sr Let the gravitational mass M be thereby changed so that it acquires the value M'. 4. Let W be again raised to 82, work M',yh being done in the process. 5. Let E be transferred from W back to 8 2• The effect of this cycle is simply that 81 has undergone the increase of energy E,yh/c2, and that the quantity of energy M',yh - M,yh has been conveyed to the system in the form of mechanical work. By the principle of energy, we must therefore have or E,y~ = M',yh - M,yh, q M' - M ... E/c2 •• . (lb) The increase in gravitational mass is thus equal to E/c2, and therefore equal to the increase in inertia mass as given by the theory of relativity. The result emerges still more directly from the equivalence 104 GRAVITATION AND LIGHT of the systems Kand K', according to which the gravitational mass in respect of K is exactly equal to the inertia mass in respect of K'; energy must therefore possess a gravitational mass which is equal to its inertia mass. If a mass M0 be suspended on a spring balance in the system K', the balance will indicate the apparent weight M0,y on account of the inertia of M0• If the quantity of energy E be transferred to M 0 , the spring balance, by the law of the inertia of energy, will indicate (M0 + E/c2),y. By reason of our funda- mental assumption exactly the same thing must occur when the experiment is repeated in the system K, that is, in the gravitational field. § 3, Time and the Velocity of Light in the Oravitational Field If the radiation emitted in the uniformly accelerated system K' in 82 toward 81 had the frequency v2 relatively to the clock in 82 , then, relatively to 811 at its arrival in 81 it no longer has the frequency v2 relatively to an identical clock in 81, but a grea.ter frequency v1 , such that to a first approxi- mation . (2) For if we again introduce the unaccelerated system of refer- ence K 0, relatively to which, at the time of the emission of light, K' has no velocity, then 8 1, at the time of arrival of the radiation at 81, has, relatively to K 0, the velocity ,yh/c, from which, by Doppler's principle, the relation as given results immediately. In agreement with our assumption of the equivalence of the systems K' and K, this equation also holds for the stationary system of co-ordinates K, provided with a uniform gravitational field, if in it the transference by radiation takes place as described. It follows, then, that a ray of light emitted in 82 with a definite gravitational potential, and pos- sessing at its emission the frequency v2-compared with a clock in 82-will, at its arrival in 81, possess a different fre- quency v1-measured by an identical clock in 81• For ,yh we substitute the gravitational potential cl> of 8 2-that of 81 A. EINSTEIN 105 being taken as zero-and assume that the relation which we have deduced for the homogeneous gravitational field also holds for other forms of field. Then v1 = v2(1 + ~) . . (2a) This result (which by our deduction is valid to a first ap- proximation) permits, in the first place, of the following appli- cation. Let v0 be the vibration-number of an elementary light-generator, measured by a delicate clock at the same place. Let us imagine them both at a place on the surface of the Sun (where our 8 2 is located). Of the light there emitted, a portion reaches the Earth (81), where we measure the frequency of the arriving light with a clock U in all re- spects· resembling the one just mentioned. Then by (2a), v = v0(1 + ~). where <I> is the (negative) difference of gravitational potential between the surface of the Sun and the Earth. Thus accord- ing to our view the spectral lines of sunlight, as compared with the corresponding spectral lines of terrestrial sources of light, must be somewhat displaced toward the red, in fact by the relative amount Vo - V = - ~ = 2 .10-6 Vo C If the conditions under which the solar bands arise were exactly known, this shifting would be susceptible of measure- ment. But as other influences (pressure, temperature) affect the position of the centres of the spectral lines, it is difficult to discover whether the inferred influence of the gravitational potential really exists.* On a superficial consideration equation (2), or (2a), respectively, seems to· assert an absurdity. If there is con- stant transmission of light from 8 2 to Si, how can any other number of periods per second arrive in 8 1 than is emitted * L. ll', Jewell (Joum. de Phys., 6, 1897, p. 84) e.nd pe.rticularly Ch. Fabry and H. Boisson (Comptes rendus, 148, 1909, pp. 688-690) he.ve e.ctua!ly found such disple.cements of fine spectral lines toward the red end of the spectrum, of the order of me.gnitude here ca.!culated, but have a.scribed them to an effect of pressure ip. the absorbing le.yer. 106 GRAVITATION AND LIGHT in 82 ? But the answer is simple. We cannot regard v2 or respectively 111 simply as frequencies (as the number of periods per second) since we have not yet determined the time in system K. What 112 denotes is the number of periods with reference to the time-unit of the clock U in 82, while 111 de- notes the number of periods per second with reference to the identical clock in 81\" Nothing compels us to assume that the clocks U in different gravitation potentials must be regarded as going at the same rate. On the contrary, we must certainly define the time in K in such a way that the number of wave crests and troughs between 8 2 and 81 is independent of the absolute value of time ; for the process under observation is by nature a stationary one. If we did not satisfy this con- dition, we should arrive at a definition of time by the appli- cation of which time would merge explicitly into the laws of nature, and this would certainly be unnatural and un- practical. Therefore the two clocks in 81 and 82 do not both give the \"time\" correctly. If we measure time in 81 with the clock U, then we must measure time in 82 with a clock which goes 1 + (f>/,;2 times more slowly than the clock U when compared with U at one and the same place. For when measured by such a clock the frequency of the ray of light which is considered above is at its emission in 82 v2(1 + ~) and is therefore, by (2a), equal to the frequency 111 of the same ray of light on its arrival in 81\" This has a consequence which is of fundamental impor- tance for our theory. For if we measure the velocity of light at different places in the accelerated, gravitation-free.system K', employing clocks U of identical constitution, we obtain the same magnitude at all these places. The same holds good, by our fundamental assumption, for the system K as well. But from what has just been said we must use clocks of unlike constitution, for measuring time at places with differing gravitation potential. For measuring time at a place which, relatively to the origin of the co-ordinates, has the gravitation potential (f>, we must employ a. clock which- when removed to the origin of co-ordinates-goes (1 + (f>/c2) times more slowly than the clock used for measuring time at A. EINSTEIN 107 the origin of co-ordinates. If we call the velocity of light at the origin of co-ordinates c0, then the velocity of light c at a place with the gravitation potential <I> will be given by the relation c = c0(1 + ;) (3) The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light holds good according to this theory in a different form from that which usually underlies the ordinary theory of relativity. § 4. Bending of Light· ~ays in the Gravitational Field From the proposition which has just been proved, that the velocity of light in the gravitational field is a function of the place, we may easily infer, by means of Huyghens's principle, that light-rays propagated across a gravitational field undergo deflexion. For let Ebe a wave front of a plane light-wave at the time t, and let P 1 and P 2 be two points in that plane at E P. FIG. 6. unit distance from each other. P 1 and P 2 lie in the plane of the paper, which is chosen so that the differential coefficient of <I>, taken in the direction of the normal to the plane, vanishes, and therefore also that of c. We obtain the corre- sponding wave front at time t + dt, or, rather, its line of section with the plane of the paper, by describing circles round the points P1 and P2 with radii c1dt and c2dt respectively, where ·c1 and c2 denote the velocity of light at the points P1 and P2 respectively, and by drawing the tangent to these circles. The angle through which the light-ray is deflected in the path cdt is therefore i)c (c1 - c2)dt = - i)n'dt, if we calculate the angle positively when the ray is bent to- ward the side of increasing r,,'. The angle of deflexion per unit of path of the light-ray is thus 1 i)c 1 i)<I> - 0 \"'l)n,', or by (3) - c2 i)n'' 108 GRAVITATION AND LIGHT Finally, we obtain for the de:flexion which a. light-ray experi- ences toward the side n' on a.ny pa.th (s) the expression a= - }J::ds . . (4) We might have obtained the sa.me result by directly consider- ing the propagation of a. ra.y of light in the uniformly acceler- ated system K', and transferring the result to the system K, a.nd thence to the case of a gravitational field of any form. By equation (4) a ray of light passing along by a. heavenly body suffers a de:flexion to the side of the diminishing gravi- tational potential, that is, on the side directed toward the heavenly body, of the magnitude a = _!1 9 = k~ cos Ods = 2kM c2 ,.2 c2t:J.. 9= - tr where k denotes the constant of gravitation, M the mass of FIG. 7. the heavenly body, l::.. the distance of the ray from the centre of the body. A ray of light going pa.st the Sun would accord- ingly undergo de:flexion to the amount of 4·10 - 6 = ·83 seconds of a.re. The angu- lar distance of the star from the centre of the Sun appears to be increased by this amount. As the fixed stars in the parts of the sky near the Sun are visible during total eclipses of the Sun, this consequence of the theory may be com- pared with experience. With the planet Jupiter the displacement to be expected reaches to a.bout rtn- of the amount given. It would be a most desirable thing if astronomers would take up the question here raised. For apart from any theory there is the question whether it is possible with the equipment at present available to detect a.n influence of gravitational fields- on the propagation of light. THE FOUNDATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVI'l'Y BY A. EINSTEIN Translated from \"Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Rela- tivitatstheorie,\" .Annalen der Physik, 49, 1916. THE F'OUNDATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY BY A. EINSTEIN A. FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE POSTULATE OF RELATIVITY § 1. Observations on the Special Theory of Relativity T HE special theory of relativity is based on the following postulate, which is also satisfied by the mechanics of Galileo and Newton. If a system of co-ordinates K is chosen so that, in re- lation to it, physical laws hold good in their simplest form, the same laws also hold good in relation to any other system of co-ordinates K' moving in uniform translation relatively to K. This postulate we call the '' special principle of relativity.\" The word \" special \" is meant to intimate that the principle is restricted to the case when K' has a motion of uniform translation relatively to K, but that the equivalence of K' and K does not extend to the case of non- uniform motion of K' relatively to K. Thus the special theory of relativity does not depart from classical mechanics through the postulate of relativity, but through the postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo, from which, in combination with the special prin- ciple of relativity, there follow, in the well-known way, the relativity of simultaneity, the Lorentzian transformation, and the related laws for the behaviour of moving bodies and clocks. The modification to which the special theory of relativity has subjected the theory of space and time is indeed far- reaching, but one important point has remained unaffected. 111 112 THE GENERAL THEORY For the laws of geometry, even according to the special theory of relativity, a.re to be interpreted directly a.s laws relating to the possible relative positions of solid bodies at rest; and, in a more general way, the laws of kinematics are to be inter- preted as laws which describe the relations of measuring bodies and clocks. To two selected material points of a stationary rigid body there always corresponds a distance of quite definite length, which is independent of the locality and orientation of the body, and is also independent of the time. To two selected positions of the hands of a clock at rest relatively to the privileged system of reference there always corresponds a.n interval of time of a definite length, which is independent of place and time. We shall soon see that the general theory of relativity cannot adhere to this simple physical interpretation of space and time. § 2. The Need for an Extension of the Postulate of Relativity In classical mechanics, and no less in the special theory of relativity, there is an inherent epistemological defect which was, perhaps for the first time, clearly pointed out by Ernst Mach. We will elucidate it by the following example :-Two fluid bodies of the same size and nature hover freely in space at so great a. distance from each other and from all other masses that only those gravitational forces need be taken into account which arise from the interaction of different parts of the same body. Let the distance between the two bodies be invariable, and in neither of the bodies let there be any relative movements of the parts with respect to one another. But let either mass, a.s judged by an observer at rest relatively to the other mass, rotate with constant angular velocity a.bout the line joining the masses. This is a verifi- able relative motion of the two bodies. Now let us imagine that each of the bodies has been surveyed by means of measuring instruments at rest relatively to itself, and let the surface of 81 prove to be a sphere, and that of 82 a.n ellipsoid of re-volution. Thereupon we put the question-What is the reason for this difference in the two bodies? No answer can A. EINSTEIN 118 be admitted a.s epistemologically satisfactory,* unless the reason given is an observable fact of experience. The la.w of causality ha.s not the significance of a statement a.s to the world of experience, except when observable facts ultimately appear as ca.uses and effects. Newtonian mechanics does not give a satisfactory answer to this question. It pronounces as follows :-The laws of mechanics apply to the space Ri, in respect to which the body 81 is at rest, but not to the space R 2, in respect to which the body 82 is at rest. But the privileged space R 1 of Galileo, thus introduced, is a merely factiti<YUs cause, and not a thing that can be observed. It is therefore clear that Newton's mechanics does not really satisfy the requirement of causality in the case under consideration, but only apparently does so, since it makes the factitious cause R1 responsible for the ob- servable difference in the bodies 81 and 8 2• The only satisfactory answer must be that the physical system consisting of 81 and 82 reveals within itself no imagin- able cause to which the differing behaviour of 81 and 82 can be referred. The cause must therefore lie outside this system. We have to take it that the general laws of motion, which in particular determine the shapes of 81 and 82, must be such that the mechanical behaviour of 81 and 82 is partly con- ditioned, in quite essential respects, by distant masses which we have not included in the system under consideration. These distant masses a.nd their motions relative to 81 and 82 must then be regarded as the seat of the causes (which must be susceptible to observation) of the different behaviour of our two bodies 81 and 82• They take over the r6le of the factitious cause R1• Of all imaginable spaces R 1, R 2, etc., in any kind of motion relatively to one another, there is none which we may look upon as privileged a priori without re- viving the above-mentioned epistemological objection. The laws of physics must be of such a nature that they apply to systems of reference in any kind of motion. Along this road we arrive at an extension of the postulate of rela.tivity. In addition to this weighty argument from the theory of * Of course an answer ma.y be satisfactory from the point of view of episte. mology, and yet be unsound physically, if it is in conflict with other experi- ences. 114 THE GENERAL THEORY knowledge, there is a well-known physical fa.ct which favours an extension of the theory of relativity. Let K be a Galilean system of reference, ie. a. system relatively to which (at least in the four-dimensional region under consideration) a mass, sufficiently distant from other masses, is moving with uniform motion in a straight line. Let K' be a second system of reference which is moving relatively to K in uniformly accelerated translation. Then, relatively to K', a mass sufficiently distant from other masses would have an acceler- ated motion such that its acceleration and direction of acceleration are independent of the material composition and physical state of the mass. Does this permit an observer at rest relatively to K' to infer that he is on a\" really \" accelerated system of reference? The answer is in the negative ; for the above-mentioned relation of freely movable masses to K' may be interpreted equally well in the following way. The system of reference K' is unaccelerated, but the space-time territory in question is under the sway of a gravitational field, which generates the accelerated motion of the bodies relatively to K'. This view is ma.de possible for us by the teaching of experience as to the existence of a field of force, namely, the gravitational field, which possesses the remarkable property of imparting the same acceleration to all bodies.* The mechanical behaviour of bodies relatively to K' is the same as presents itself to experience in the case of systems which we are wont to regard as \" stationary \" or as \" privileged.\" Therefore, from the physical staadpoint, the assumption readily suggests itself that the systems K and K' may both with equal right be looked upon as \"stationary,\" that is to say, they have an equal title as systems of reference for the physical description of phenomena. It will be seen from these reflexions that in pursuing the general theory of relativity we shall be led to a theory of gravitation, since we a.re able to \"produce\" a gravitational field merely by changing the system of co-ordinates. It will also be obvious that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo must be modified, since we easily * Eotvos has proved experimentally that the gravitational field has this property in great aocuraoy. A. EINSTEIN ll5 recognize that the path of a ray of light with respect to K' must in general be curvilinear, if with respect to K light is propagated in a straight line with a definite constant velocity. § 3. The Space-Time Continuum. Requirement of Oeneral Co-Variance for the Equations Expressing General Laws of Nature In classical mechanics, as well as in the special theory of relativity, the co-ordinates of space and time have a direct physical meaning. To say that a point-event has the X1 co- ordinate x1 means that the projection of the point-event on the a.xis of Xi, determined by rigid rods and in accordance with the. rules of Euclidean geometry, is obtained by measuring off a given rod (the unit of length) x1 times from the origin of co- ordinates along the axis of X1. To say that a. point-event has the X4 co-ordinate x4 = t, means that a standard clock, made to measure time in a definite unit period, and which is stationary relatively to the system of co-ordinates and practic- ally coincident in space with the point-event,* will ha.ve measured off x4 = t periods at the occurrence of the event. This view of space and time has always been in the minds of physicists, even if, as a rule, they have been unconscious of it. This is clear from the part which these concepts play in physical measurements; it must also have underlain the reader's reflexions on the preceding paragraph (§ 2) for him to connect any meaning with what he there read. But we shall now show that we must put it aside and replace it by a more general view, in order to be able to carry through the postulate of general relativity; if the special theory of relativity applies to the special case of the absence of a gravi- tational field. In a space which is free of gravitational fields we introduce a Galilean system of reference K (x, y, z, t), and also a system of co-ordinates K' (x', y', z', t') in uniform rotation relatively to K. Let the origins of both systems, as well as their axes * We assume the possibility of verifying \" simultaneity \" for events im- mediately proximate in spa.ca, or-to spea.k more precisely-for immediate proximity or coincidence in spa.ca-time, without giving a definition of this funda.menta.l concept. 116 THE GENERAL THEORY of Z, permanently coincide. We shall show that for a space- time measurement in the system K' the above definition of the physical meaning of lengths and times cannot be main- tained. For reasons of symmetry it is clear that a circle a.round the origin in the X, Y plane of K may at the same time be regarded as a circle in the X', Y' plane of K'. We suppose that the circumference and diameter of this circle have been measured with a unit measure infinitely small compared with the radius, and that we have the quotient of the two results. If this experiment were performed with a measuring-rod at rest relatively to the Galilean system K, the quotient would be 'If', With a measuring-rod at rest relatively to K', the quotient would be greater than 'If'. This is readily understood if we envisage the whole process of measuring from the \" stationary \" system K, and take into consideration that the measuring-rod applied to the periphery undergoes a, Lorentzian contraction, while the one applied along the radius does not. Hence Euclidean geometry does not apply to K'. The notion of co-ordinates defined above, which pre- supposes the validity of Euclidean geometry, therefore breaks down in relation to the system K'. So, too, we are unable to introduce a, time corresponding to physical requirements in K', indicated by clocks at rest, relatively to K'. To convince ourselves of this impossibility, let us imagine two clocks of identical constitution placed, one at the origin of co-ordinates, and the other at the circumference of the circle, and both envisaged from the \"stationary\" system K. By a. familiar result of the special theory of relativity, the clock at the circumference-judged from K-goes more slowly than the other, because the former is in motion and the latter a.t rest. An observer at the common origin of co-ordinates, capable of observing the clock at the circum- ference by means of light, would therefore see it lagging be- hind the clock beside him. As he will not make up his mind to let the velocity of light a.long the pa.th in question depend explicitly on the time, he will interpret his observations as showing that the clock at the circumference \" really \" goes more slowly than the clock at the origin. So he will be obliged to define time in such a way that the rate of a clock depends upon where the clock may be. A. EINSTEIN 117 We therefore reach this result :-In the genera.I theory of relativity, space and time cannot be defined in such a way that differences of the spatial co-ordinates can be directly measured by the unit measuring-rod, or differences in the time co-ordinate by a standard clock. The method hitherto employed for laying co-ordinates into the space-time continuum in a defi.nite manner thus breaks down, and there seems to be no other way which would allow us to adapt systems of co-ordinates to the four-dimensional universe so that we might expect from their application a particularly simple formulation of the laws of nature. So there is nothing for it but to regard all imaginable systems of co-ordinates, on principle, as equally suitable for the description of nature. This comes to requiring that :- The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equations which hold good for all systems of co-ordinates, that is, are co-variant with respect to any substitutions whatever (generally co-variant). It is clear that a, physical theory which satisfies this postulate will also be suitable for the genera.I postulate of relativity. For the sum of all substitutions in any case in- cludes those which correspond to all relative motions of three- dimensional systems of co-ordinates. That this requirement of general co-variance, which takes away from space and time the last remnant of physical objectivity, is a. natural one, will be seen from the following reflexion. All our space-time verifications invariably amount to a determination of space-time coincidences. If, for example, events consisted merely in the motion of material points, then ultimately nothing would be observable but the meetings of two or more of these points. Moreover, the results of our measurings are nothing but verifications of such meetings of the material points of our measuring instruments with other material points, coincidences between the hands of a clock and points on the clock dial, and observed point-events happening at the same place at the same time. The introduction of a system of reference serves no other purpose than to facilitate the description of the totality of such coincidences. We allot to the universe four space-time vari- ables x1, x2, x3, x4 in such a way that for every point-event 118 THE GENERAL THEORY there is a corresponding system of values of the variables x 1 ••• x4• To two coincident point-events there corre- sponds one system of values of the variables x1 • • • x4 , i.e. coincidence is characterized by the identity of the co-ordinates. If, in place of the variables x 1 • • • x4 , we introduce functions of them, x'i, x\\, x'3, x'4, a.s a. new system of co-ordin8!_tes, so that the systems of values a.re made to correspond to one another without ambiguity, the equality of all four co-ordin- ates in the new system will also serve as an expression for the space-time coincidence of the two point-events. As all our physical experience can be ultimately reduced to such coincidences, there is no immediate reason for preferring certain systems of co-ordinates to others, that is to say, we arrive at the requirement of general co-variance. § 4. The Relation of the Four Co-ordinates to Measure- ment in Space and Time It is not my purpose in this discussion to represent the general theory of relativity a.s a, system that is as simple and logical as possible, and with the minimum number of axioms; but my ma.in object is to develop this theory in such a, way that the reader will feel that the path we have entered upon is psychologically the natural one, and that the underlying assumptions will seem to have the highest possible degree of security. With this aim in view let it now be granted that:- For infinitely small four-dimensional regions the theory of relativity in the restricted sense is appropriate, if the co- ordinates are suitably chosen. For this purpose we must choose the acceleration of the infinitely small (\" local \") system of co-ordinates so that no gravitational field occurs; this is possible for an infinitely small region. Let X1, X 2, X3, be the co-ordinates of space, and X4 the appertaining co-ordinate of time measured in the appropriate unit.* If a rigid rod is imagined to be given as the unit measure, the co-ordinates, with a given orientation of the system of co-ordinates, have a direct physical meaning * The unit of time is to be chosen so tha.t the velocity of light in vacuo a.s mes.sured in the \" local\" system. of co-ordinates is to be equal to unity. A. EINSTEIN 119 in the sense of the special theory of relativity. By the special theory of relativity the expression as2 = - dX2 - ax• - dX 1 + ax• (1) l I 3 ' then has a value which is independent of the orientation of the local system of co-ordinates, and is ascertainable by measurements of space and time. The magnitude of the linear element pertaining to points of the four-dimensional continuum in infinite proximity, we call as. If the as belong- ing to the element ax1 • • • aX4 is positive, we follow Minkowski in calling it time-like ; if it is negative, we call it space-like. To the \"linear element'' in question, or to the two infin- itely ,proximate point-events, .there will also correspond definite differentials ax1 • • • ax4 of the four-dimensional co-ordinates of any chosen system of reference. If this system, as well as the \" local \" system, is given for the region under consideration, the ax,, will allow themselves to be represented here by definite linear homogeneous expressions of the ax(T:- Inserting these expressions in (1), we obtain as2 = ~ g <T-rrkr,<Tdx.,, • T<T (2) (3) where the g<TT will be functions of the x(T, These can no longer be dependent on the orientation and the state of motion of the \" local \" system of co-ordinates, for as2 is a quantity ascertainable by rod-clock measurement of point- events infinitely proximate in space-time, and defined inde- pendently of any particular choice of co-ordinates. The g(T., are to be chosen here so that g(T., = g.,(1'; the summation is to extend over all values of u and or, so that the sum consists of 4 x 4 terms, of which twelve are equal in pairs. The case of the ordinary theory of relativity a.rises out of the case here considered, if it is possible, by reason of the particular relations of the g<TT in a finite region, to choose the system of reference in the finite region in such a way that the g<TT assume the co~stant values 120 THE GENERAL THEORY - 1 0 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 - 1 0 0 j} . (4) We shall find hereafter that the choice of such co-ordinates is, in general, not possible for a finite region. From the considerations of § 2 and § 3 it follows that the quantities g\"',. are to be regarded from the physical stand- point as the quantities which describe the gravitational field in relation to the chosen system of reference. For, if we now assume the special theory of relativity to apply to a certain four-dimensional region with the co-ordinates properly chosen, then the g<TT have the values given in (4). A free material point then moves, relatively to this system, with uniform motion in a straight line. Then if we introduce new space-time co-ordinates x1, x2, x 3, x 4, by means of any substi- tution we choose, the gu\"' in this new system will no longer be constants, but functions of space and time. At the same time the motion of the free material point will present itself in the new co-ordinates as a curvilinear non-uniform motion, and the law of this motion will be independent of the nature of the moving particle. We shall therefore interpret this motion as a motion under the influence of a gravitational field. We thus find the occurrence of a gravitational field connected with a space-time variability of the gu . So, too, in the general case, when we a.re no longer able by a suitable choice of co-ordinates to apply the special theory of relativity to a finite region, we shall hold fast to the view that the gu,,. describe the gravitational field. Thus, according to the general theory of relativity, gravi- tation occupies an exceptional position with regard to other forces, particularly the electromagnetic forces, since the ten functions representing the gravitational field at the same time define the metrical properties of the space measured. B. MATHEMATICAL Arns TO THE FORMULATION OF GENERALLY COVARIANT EQUATIONS Having seen in the foregoing that the general postulate of relativity leads to the requirement that the equations of A. EINSTEIN 121 physics shall be covariant in the face of any substitution of the co-ordinates x 1 ••• x 4, we have to consider how such generally covariant equations can be found. We now tum to this purely mathematical task, and we shall find that in its solution a fundamental r6le is played by the invariant ds given in equation (3), which, borrowing from Gauss's theory of surfaces, we have called the \"linear element.\" The fundamental idea of this general theory of covariants is the following :-Let certain things (\"tensors\") be defined with respect to any system of co-ordinates by a number of functions of the co-ordinates, called the \" components \" of the tensor. There are then certain rules by which these components can be calculated for a new system of co-ordin- ates, if they are known for the original system of co-ordinates, and if the transformation connecting the two systems is known. The things hereafter called tensors are further characterized by the fact that the equations of transformation for their components are linear and homogeneous. Accord- ingly, all the components in the new system vanish, if they all vanish in the original system. If, therefore, a law of nature is expressed by equating all the components of a tensor to zero, it is generally covariant. By examining the laws of the formation of tensors, we acquire the means of formu- lating generally covariant laws. § 5. Contravariant and Covariant Four-vectors Contravariant Four-vectors.-The linear element is de- fined by the four \" components \" dx11, for which the law of transformation is expressed by the equation d , ...,3x',rd X,r =.:;~Xv. II uX11 . (5) The dx' ,r are expressed as linear and homogeneous functions of the dxv. Hence we may look upon these co-ordinate differ- entials as the components of a \" tensor \" of the particular kind which we call a contra.variant four-vector. Any thing which is defined relatively to the system of co-ordinates by four quantities A', and which is transformed by the same law A'\" = ~ 3x',r A' . (5a) 113X11 ' 122 THE GENERAL THEORY we a.lso ca.11 a. contra.va.ria.nt four-vector. From (5a.) it follows a.t once that the sums A\"± B\" a.re a.lso components of a. four-vector, if A\" a.nd B\" are such. Corresponding rela- tions hold for a.11 \" tensors \" subsequently to be introduced. (Rule for the a.ddition a.nd subtraction of tensors.) Covariant Four-vectors.-We ca.11 four quantities A11 the components of a. covariant four-vector, if for a.ny arbitrary choice of the contra.variant four-vector B\" l'A11B\" = Inva.ria.nt (6) .. The law of tra.nsforma.tion of a. covaria.nt four-vector follows from this definition. For if we replace B' on the right-ha.nd side of the equation l'A'O'B'\" = l'A,,B' O' II by the expression resulting from the inversion of (5a.), we obtain l'i)z: B'\", O' i'lx O' l'B'\"l'i)x~ A11 = l'B'O' A'.,. O' II i')z O' O' Since this equation is true for arbitrary values of the B'a, it follows that the law of transformation is A' - i'l!x11 A O' - V IJX' O' II (7) Note on a Simplified Way of Writing the Expressions.- A glance at the equations of this pa.ra.gra.ph shows that there is a.lways a. summation with respect to the indices which occur twice under a. sign of summation ( e.g. the index v in (5)), a.nd only with respect to indices which occur twice. It is therefore possible, without loss of clea.rness, to omit the sign of summa.tion. In its place we introduce the convention :- If an index occurs twice in one term of an expression, it is a.lwa.ys to be summed unless the contrary is expressly stated. The difference between covariant a.nd contrava.riant four- vectors lies in the law of transformation ((7) or (5) respectively). Both forms are tensors in the sense of the genera.I remark a.hove. Therein lies their importance. Following Ricci a.nd A. EINSTEIN 123 Levi-Civita, we denote the contravariant character by placing the index above, the covariant by placing it below. § 6. Tensors of the Second and Higher Ranks Contravariant Tensors.-If we form all the sixteen pro- ducts A\"\"v of the components A\"\" and Bv of two contravariant four-vectors (8) then by (8) and (5a) A\"\"v satisfies the law of transformation A'\"T = ~x' a-_ !x'.,. A\"\"v . (9) uXµ. uX11 We call a thing which is described relatively to any system of reference by sixteen quantities; satisfying the law of trans- formation (9), a. contra.variant tensor of the second rank. Not every such tensor allows itself to be formed in accordance with (8) from two four-vectors, but it is easily shown that any given sixteen A\"\"v can be represented as the sums of the A!'B' of four appropriately selected pairs of four-vectors. Hence we can prove nearly all the laws which apply to the teµsor of the second rank defined by (9) in the simplest manner by demonstrating them for the special tensors of the type (8). Contravariant Tensors of Any Rank.-It is clear that, on the lines of (8) and (9), contra variant tensors of the third and higher ranks may also be defined with 43 components, and so on. In the same way it follows from (8) and (9) that the contra.variant four-vector may be ta.ken in this sense as a contravariant tensor of the first rank. Covariant Tensors.-On the other hand, if we take the sixteen products A,..,, of two covariant four-vectors A,.. and B,,, A,..,, = A,..B,,, (10) the law of transformation for these is A, i)z,.. i)z,,A O''T = -=,.-, ~ ,.,.,, uX O' uX.,. . (11) This law of transformation defines the covariant tensor of the second rank. All our previous remarks on contravariant tensors apply equally to covariant tensors. 124 THE GENERAL THEORY NoTE.-It is convenient to treat the scalar (or invariant) both as a contra.variant and a covariant tensor of zero rank. Mixed Tensors.-We may also define a tensor of the second rank of the type A; = A\"B' . (12) which is covariant with respect to the index µ,, and contra.- variant with respect to .the index v. Its law of transforma- tion is . (13) Naturally there are mixed tensors with any number of indices of covariant character, and any number of indices of contra.variant character. Covariant and contravariant tensors may be looked upon as special cases of mixed tensors. Symmetrical Tensors.-A contravaria.nt, or a covariant tensor, of the second or higher rank is said to be symmetrical if two components, which a.re obtained the one from the other by the interchange of two indices, are equal. The tensor A\"', or the tensor A\"\"' is thus symmetrical if for any combination of the indices µ,, v, A\"\"= A'\", or respectively, (14) . (14a) It has to be proved that the symmetry thus defined is a property which is independent of the system of reference. It follows in fact from (9), when (14) is taken into consider- ation, that A'\"\" - <>x' <T <>x' TA\"' = <>x' <T <>x' TA'\"\" - <>x' <T <>x' TA\"' - A'Trr <>xi' <>x,, <>xi' <>x,, <>x,, <>xi' · The last equation but one depends upon the interchange of the summation indices µ, and v, i.e. merely on a change of notation. Antisymmetrical Tensors.-A contra.variant or a covariant tensor of the second, third, or fourth rank is said to be anti- symmetrical if two components, which are obtained the one from the other by the interchange of two indices, are equal and of opposite sign. The tensor A\"\"', or the tensor A\"\"' is therefore antisymmetrical, if always or respectively, A. EINSTEIN 125 (15) Aµ,, = - A,,µ (15a) Of the sixteen components A\"\", the four components A\"\" vanish ; the rest are equal and of opposite sign in pairs, so that there are only six components numerically different (a. six-vector). Similarly we see that the antisymmetrical tensor of the third rank A\"\"\" has only four numerically different components, while the antisymmetrical tensor A\"\"'\" has only one. There are no antisymmetrical tensors of higher ra.nk than the fourth in a continuum of four dimensions. § 7. Multiplication of Tensors Outer Multiplication of Tensors.-We obtain from the components of a tensor of rank n and of a tensor of rank m the components of a. tensor of rank n + m by multiplying each component of the one tensor by ea.ch component of the other. Thus, for example, the tensors T arise out of the tensors A and B of different kinds, Tµv<I' = Aµ,,B<I', T\"\"'\" = A\"\"B\"\", T; = AµvB\"\". The proof of the tensor character of T is given directly by the representations (8), (10), (12), or by the laws of trans- formation (9), (11), (13). The equations (8), (10), (12) a.re themselves examples of outer multiplication of tensors of the first rank. \" Contraction \" of a Mixed Tensor .-From any mixed tensor we may form a tensor whose ra.nk is less by two, by equating an index of covariant with one of contra.variant character, and summing with respect to this index (\" con- traction \"). Thus, for example, from the mixed tensor of the fourth rank A::, we obtain the mixed tensor of the second rank, A: = A:; ( = l'A:;}, µ and from this, by a second contraction, the tensor of zero rank, 126 THE GENERAL THEORY The proof that the result of contraction really possesses the tensor character is given either by the representation of a. tensor according to the generalization of (12) in combination with (6), or by the generalization of (13). Inner and Mixed Multiplication of Tensors.-These consist in a combination of outer multiplication with contraction. Examples.-From the covariant tensor of the second rank Ap.11 and the contravariant tensor of the first rank Ba- we form by outer multiplication the mixed tensor n;., = A,..,Ba-. On contraction with respect to the indices JI and er, we obtain the·covariant four-vector D,. = n;., = A,..,B·. This we call the inner product of the tensors A,.., and Ba-. Analogously we form from the tensors A,.., and B'\"', by outer multiplication a.nd double contraction, the inner product A,..,B\"'. By outer multiplication and one contraction, we obtain from A,.., and B'\" the mixed tensor of the second rank n; = A,..,B,,... This operation may be aptly characterized as a mixed one, being \" outer \" with respect to the indices µ. and ,-, and \"inner\" with respect to the indices JI and er. We now prove a, proposition which is often useful as evi- dence of tensor character. From what ha.s just been ex- plained, A,..,B\"' is a scalar if A,.., and B'\" a.re tensors. But we may also make the following assertion : If A,..,B\"' is a. scalar for any choice of the tensor B\"', then A,.., has tensor character. For, by hypothesis, for any substitution, A' O'T:e''\" = A,..,B\"'. But oy an inversion of (9) B\"' - <JXµ <JX\"B''\" - ?,x'IT ?,x'.,. • This, inserted in the above equation, gives ( A' - <JXµ <JX., A )B''\" = 0 O'T ?,x' IT ?,x'.,. ,.., • This can only be satisfied for arbitra.ry values of B''\" if the A. EINSTEIN 127 bracket vanishes. The result then follows by equation (11). This rule applies correspondingly to tensors of any rank and character, and the proof is analogous in all cases. The rule may also be demonstrated in this form : If B\" and cv are any vectors, and if, for all values of these, the inner product A,,.,,B\"'Cv is a scalar, then A,,.,, is a cova.ria.nt tensor. This latter proposition also holds good even if only the more special assertion is correct, that with any choice of the four-vector B\" the inner product A,,.,,B\"Bv is a scalar, if in addition it is known tha.t A,,.,, satisfies the condition of symmetry A,,.,, = A,,,,_ For by the method given above we prove the tensor character of (A,,.,, + A,,,,.), and from this the tensor character of A,,.,, follows on account of symmetry. This also can be easily generalized to the case of covariant and contravariant tensors of any rank. Finally, there follows from what has been proved, this law, which may also be generalized for any tensors: If for a.ny choice of the four-vector Bv the quantities A,,.,,Bv form a. tensor of the first rank, then A,,.,, is a tensor of the second rank. For, if C\" is any four-vector, then on account of the tensor character of A,,.,,Bv, the inner product A,,.,,Bvc,. is a. scalar for any choice of the two four-vectors Bv a.nd C\". From which the proposition follows. § 8. Some Aspects of the Fundamental Tensor g,,.,, The Covariant Fundamental Tensor.-In the invariant expression for the square of the linear element, ds 2 = g,,.,,ax,,.dx,,, the pa.rt played by the dx,,. is that of a contrava.ria.nt vector which may be chosen a.t will. Since further, g,,.,, = g.,,,., it follows from the considerations of the preceding paragraph that g,,.,, is a. covariant tensor of the second rank. We call it the \"fundamental tensor.\" In what follows we deduce some properties of this tensor which, it is true, apply to any tensor of the second rank. But a.s the fundamental tensor plays a special pa.rt in our theory, which has its physical basis in the peculiar effects of gra.vita.tion, it so happens that the relations to be developed are of importance to us only in the case of the funda.menta.l tensor. 128 THE GENERAL THEORY The Oontravariant Fundamental Tensor.-If in the deter- minant formed by the elements gp.11, we take the co-factor of each of the g,,.,, and divide it by the determinant g = I g,,.,, I , we obtain certain quantities gP.11( = g\"P.) whiqh, as we shall demonstrate, form a contra.variant tensor. By a known property of determinants g ,,.,rg\"(T = o; crn> where the symbol o; denotes 1 or 0, according as µ, = v or µ, + v. Instead of the above expression for ds2 we may thus write gµ.uo:dx,,.dx,, or, by (16) g µ.ug ll'Tgrrrdx µ.dx,,. But, by the multiplication rules of the preceding paragraphs, the quantities form a covariant four-vector, and in fact an arbitrary vector, since the dx,,. a.re arbitrary. By introducing this into our ex- pression we obtain ds 2 = grrrdf udf.,.. Since this, with the arbitrary choice of the vector dfu, is a scalar, and grrr by its definition is symmetrical in the indices u and T, it follows from the results of the preceding paragraph that grrr is a contravariant tensor. It further follows from (16) that S,,. is also a tensor, which we may call the mixed fundamental tensor. The Determinant of the Fundamental Tensor.-By the rule for the multiplication of determinants I g.,,.,,.g\"'\" I I g µ.a I x I g\"'\" I . On the other hand I gµ.ag\"\"' I It therefore follows that Io; I = 1. I gp.11 I x I g,,.,, I = 1 . . (17) The Volume Saalar.-We seek first the law of transfor- A. EINSTEIN 129 mation of the determinant g = I g,,.,, I . In accordance with (11) g' = II ~x~ ~-~-g I , , , , ,,.,, I . vX.,. vX., Hence, by a double application of the rule for the multipli- cation of determinants, it follows that I i'lx,,_ I I i'lx / I i)x,,_ 1 2 g' = I i'lx'.,. r · i'lx~., · I g,,.,, I = I i'lx'.,. g, or ~g' = I::~.,. I ~g. On the other hand, the law of transformation of the element of volume dT = J dx1dX2dx3dX4 is, in accordance with the theorem of Jacobi, d ' I i)x'.,. I d T = I i)x,,_ T. By multiplication of the la.st two equations, we obtain ~gdT 1 = ~gdT (18). Instead of ~g, we introduce in what follows the quantity ~-::--g, which is always real on account of the hyperbolic character of the space-time continuum. Theinvariant~ - gdT is equal to the magnitude of the four-dimensional element of volume in the \" local \" system of reference, as measured with rigid rods and clocks in the sense of the special theory of relativity. Note on the Character of the Space-time Continuum.-Our assumption that the special theory of relativity can always be applied to an infinitely small region, implies that ds 2 can always be expressed in accordance with (1) by means of real quantities dX1 ••• dX4• If we denote by dT0 the \"natural\" element of volume dX1, d~, dX3, dX4, then dT0 = J - gdT . (18a) 130 THE GENERAL THEORY If ../ - g were to vanish at a point of the four-dimensional continuum, it would mean that at this point an infinitely small \" natural \" volume would correspond to a finite volume in the co-ordinates. Let us assume that this is never the case. Then g cannot change sign. We will assume that, in the sense of the special theory of relativity, g always has a finite negative value. This is a hypothesis as to the physical nature of the continuum under consideration, and at the same time a convention as to the choice of co-ordinates. But if - g is always finite and positive, it is natural to settle the choice of co-ordinates a posteriori in such a way that this quantity is always equal to unity. We shall see later that by such a restriction of the choice of co-ordinates it is possible to achieve an important simplification of the laws of nature. In place of (18), we then have simply dT' = dT, from which, in view of Jacobi's theorem, it follows that I ::; I = 1 . . (19) Thus, with this choice of co-ordinates, only substitutions for which the determinant is unity are permissible. But it would be erroneous to believe that this step indicates a partial abandonment of the general postulate of relativity. We do not ask \"What are the laws of nature which are co- variant in face of all substitutions for which the determinant is unity ? \" but our question is \" What a.re the generally co- variant laws of nature?\" It is not until we have formulated these that we simplify their expression by a. particular choice of the system of reference. The Formation of New Tensors by Means of the Funda- mental Tensor.-Inner, outer, and mixed multiplication of a tensor by the fundamental tensor give tensors of different character and rank. For example, A\"·= gu.uAIT, A = gµ,,A\"v. The following forms may be specially noted :- A\"\"v = gµa.gvf3 Aa.13, Aµ,, = gµa.g,,13Aa.fJ A. EINSTEIN 181 (the \"complements\" of covariant and contravariant tensors respectively), and B,w, = g,,.,,ga.FJAa.fJ· We call B,,.,, the reduced tensor associated with A,,.,,. Similarly, B\"• = g,,.\"Ua.fJAa.fJ. It may be noted that gµ.11 is nothing more than the comple- ment of gµ,,, since § 9. The Equation of the Geodetic Line. The Motion of a Particle As the linear element ds is defined independently of the system of co-ordinates, the line drawn between two points P and P' of the four-dimensional continuum in such a way that ids is stationary-a. geodetic line-has a. meaning which also is independent of the choice of co-ordinates. Its equation is J P' 8 ds = 0 . (20) p Carrying out the variation in the usual way, we obtain from this equation four differential equations which define the geodetic line ; this operation will be inserted here for the sake of completeness. Let A be a function of the co-ordinates x,,, and let this define a family of surfaces which intersect the required geodetic line as well as all the lines in immediate proximity to it which are drawn through the points P and P'. Any such line may then be supposed to be given by expres- sing its co-ordinates x,, as functions of A. Let the symbol 8 indicate the transition from a point of the required geodetic to the point corresponding to the same A on a neighbouring line. Then for (20) we may substitute J::8wdX = 0 l 2 dx,,. dx,,J w = g,,_,, dA dA . (20a) But since 182 THE GENERAL THEORY s - !{! 1'g,.v dx,. dxv s dx,.s(dxv)} W - W 2 1'Xa aA d'JI. Xa + g,.v aA d'JI. ' a.nd s(::) = !(Sxv), we obtain from (20a.), a.fter a. pa.rtia.l integration, where . (20b) Since the va.lues of Sxtr a.re a.rbitra.ry, it follows from this tha.t ICa = 0 . (20c) a.re the equations of the geodetic line. If ds does not vanish a.long the geodetic line we ma.y choose the \" length of the a.re \" s, mes.sured a.long the geodetic line, for the para.meter 'JI.. Then w = 1, a.nd in pla.ce of (20c) we obtain d2x,. + 1'g,.v dxa dx,. - 1 1'g,.v dx,. dxv - 0 g,.v ds 2 1'Xa ds ds 2 1'Xa ds ds - or, by a. mere change of notation, d2xo. r.. ]dx,. dxv O Uo.rr ds2 + 1P'11, u ds ds = where, following Christoffel, we ha.ve written [µll, u] = !(\"Up.rr + 1'gv,r _ 1'g,.v) 2 1'x,, 1'x,,_ 1'Xa . (20d) . (21) Fina.Hy, if we multiply (20d) by gtTT (outer multiplication with respect to T, inner with respect to u), we obta.in the equations of the geodetic line in the form d 2XT { }dxp. dx., 0 ds 2 + \"' 11' T ds ds = where, following Christoffel, we ha.ve set {µ,v, T} = gTo.[}'v, a] . (22) . (23) A. EINSTEIN 188 § 10. The Formation of Tensors by Differentiation With the help of the equation of the geodetic line we can now easily deduce the laws by which new tensors can be formed from old by differentiation. By this means we a.re able for the first time to formulate generally covariant differential equations. We reach this goal by repeated appli- cation of the following simple law:- If in our continuum a. curve is given, the points of which a.re specified by the a.rcua.l distance s measured from a. fixed point on the curve, and if, further, cf> is an invariant function of space, then dcf>Jds is also an invariant. The proof lies in this, that ds is an invariant as well as def>. As therefore ,fr = ~cf> dx,. dx,. ds is also an invariant, and an invariant for all curves starting from a point of the continuum, that is, for any choice of the vector dx,_.. Hence it immediately follows that A = 'acf> . (24) ,. 'ax,. is a. covariant four-vector-the \"gradient \" of cf>. According to our rule, the differential quotient X = d,Jr ds ta.ken on a. curve, is similarly an invariant. Inserting the value of ,fr, we obtain in the first place _ 'a2c/> dx,. dx,, 'acf> d2x,. X - \"ax,.\"ax., ds ds + \"ax,. ds2 • The existence of a. tensor cannot be deduced from this forth· with. But if we may take the curve a.long which we have differentiated to be a. geodetic, we obtain on substitution for dJx,,/ds 2 from (22), ( 'a2c/> 'ac/> ) dx,. dx., X = \"ax,.\"ax., - {µv, T}'axT Ts ds • Since we may intercha.~ge the order of the differentiations, 184 THE GENERAL THEORY and since by (23) and (21) {µ.v, T} is symmetrical inµ. and v, it follows that the expression in brackets is symmetrical in µ. and v. Since a geodetic line can be drawn in a.ny direction from a point of the continuum, and therefore dx,../ds is a. four- vector with the ratio of its components arbitrary, it follows from the results of § 7 that ()2cf, 3cf, A,,.v = ~ - {µ.v, T}:;.,-. uX,,.uXv u:I:r . (25) is a covariant tensor of the second rank. We have therefore come to this result: from the covariant tensor of the first rank A = 3cf, ,,. <Ix,,. we can, by differentiation, form a covariant tensor of the second rank . (26) We call the tensor Aµ:v the\" extension\" (covariant derivative) of the tensor A,,, In the first place we can readily show that the operation leads to a tensor, even if the vector A,,. cannot be represented as a gradient. To see this, we first observe that ,fr 3cf, 3x,,. is a covariant vector, if ,fr and cf, are scalars. The sum of four such terms A-.()(1) 'l)cf,(4) 8,,. = ,fr(ll-~- + . + • + ,[r(4)_.,. -, ux,,. ux,,. is also a covariant vector, if ,fr(l), ct,<1> ••• ,tr<4>, cf,<4> are sea.la.rs. But it is clear that any covariant vector can be represented in the form S,,.. For, if A,,. is a vector whose components are any given functions of the xv, we have only to put (in terms of the selected system of co-ordinates) A,.(l) - \"' 't' - \"\"I• cf,(2) = X2, cf,(3) = X3, A,.(4) - \"' ..,., - .... ,, in order to ensure that·S,,. shall be equal to A\"\". A. EINSTEIN 185 Therefore, in order to demonstrate that A,.v is a tensor if any covariant vector is inserted on the right-hand side for A,., we only need show that this is so for the vector S,.. But for this latter purpose it is sufficient, as a glance at the right- hand side of (26) teaches us, to furnish the proof for the case A - ,fr <Jcp ,. - <Jx,.· Now the right-hand side of (25) multiplied by ,fr, \"2c/> \"\"' ,fr <Jx,.<Jxv - {µ,v, T},fr<JXT is a. tensor. Similarly \",fr \"\"' <J.x,. <Jx,, being the outer product of two vectors, is a tensor. By ad- dition, there follows the tensor character of ()!v (,fr!!,.) - {µv, ,-}(,fr!!} As a glance at (26) will show, this completes the demon- stration for the vector ,fr \"\"' <Jx,. and consequently, from what has already been proved, for any vector A,.. By means of the extension of the vector, we may easily define the \" extension \" of a. covariant tensor of any rank. This operation is a. generalization of the extension of a. vector. We restrict ourselves to the case of a. tensor of the second rank, since this suffices to give a clear idea. of the law of formation. As has already been observed, any covariant tensor of the second rank can be represented * as the sum of tensors of the * By outer multiplication of the vector with arbitrary components A.i1, Au, A13, A14 by the vector with components 1, O, 0, 0, we produce a. tensor with components An A12 A13 A14 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 o. By the addition of four tensors of this type, we obta.in the tensor A,_.,, with a.ny ssigned components. · 186 THE GENERAL THEORY type A,.B,,. It will therefore be sufficient to deduce the ex- pression for the extension of a tensor of this special type. By (26) the expressions ~A,. - {uµ., T}A,, uXa are tensors. On outer multiplication of the first by Bv, and of the second by A,., we obtain in each case a tensor of the third rank. By adding these, we have the tensor of the third rank A,.va = ~.,_A,.v - {uµ., T}A,.v - {uv, T}A,., , (27) uXa where we have put A,.,, = A,.B,,. As the right-hand side of (27) is linear and homogeneous in the A,.v and their first derivatives, this law of formation leads to a tensor, not only in the case of a tensor of the type A,.Bv, but also in the case of a sum of such tensors, i.e. in the case of any covariant tensor of the second rank. We call A,.va the extension of the tensor A,..,. It is clear that (26) and (24) concern only special cases of extension (the extension of the tensors of rank one and zero respectively). In general, all special laws of formation of tensors are in- cluded in (27) in combination with the multiplication of tensors. § 11. Some Cases of Special Importance The Fundamental Tensor.-We will first prove' some lemmas which will be useful hereafter. By the rule for the differentiation of determinants . (28) The last member is obtained from the last but one, if we bear in mind that g,.vg\"'v = s:', 80 that g,.,,g\"\" = 4, and conse- quently A.

(33) uXO' Inserting this in the second formula of (31), we obtain, in view of (23) . (34) Substituting the right-hand side of (34) in (29), we have 1 3J~ --=- = {µO', µ} J - g i)a;O' . (29a.) The \"Divergence\" of a Contravariant Vector.-!£ we take the inner product of (26) by the contra.variant funda- mental tensor g\"v, the right-hand side, after a transformation of the first term, assumes the form ~-(gp.vA,..) - A,.. i)gp.v - igro.(i)gp.o. + 1'Uvo. - 7'g,..v)gp.vAT• i)zv i)zv. i)zv i)z,.. 1'Xo. 138 THE GENERAL THEORY In accordance with (31) and (29), the last term of this ex- pression may be written i)gTV i)gTI' 1 3,../-=-iJ i~ AT + i-.,. -AT + I i) g\"\" AT, vX.,, vX,. ..., - g X 4 As the symbols of the indices of summation a.re immaterial, the first two terms of this expression cancel the second of the one above. If we then write g\"\"A,. = A\", so that A\" like A,. is a.n arbitrary vector, we finally obtain . (35) This scalar is the divergence of the contra.variant vector A\". The \" Curl \" of a Covariant Vector.-The second term in (26) is symmetrical in the indices µ, and v. Therefore A,..,, - A,,,. is a. particularly simply constructed antisym- metrical tensor. We obtain . (36) Antisymmetrical Extension of a Six-vector.-Applying (27) to an antisymmetrical tensor of the second rank A,..,,, forming in addition the two equations which arise through cyclic permutations of the indices, and adding these three equations, we obtain the tensor of the third rank B A A A 3A,.,, c!A,,u c!Au,.

EINSTEIN 139 by their values as given by (34), there results from the right- hand side of (27) an expression consisting of seven terms, of which four cancel, and there remains a.iJ ~A\"iJ A,, = -.,. - + {u,y, a}A'YiJ + {11,y, /3}A\"Y. • (38) uX,, This is the expression for the extension of a contravariant tensor of the second rank, and corresponding expressions for the extension of contravariant tensors of higher and lower rank may also be formed. We note that in an analogous way we may also form the extension of a mixed tensor:- A:,, = ~A: - {11µ., T}A: + {11T, a}A; . ~Xa . (39) On contracting (38) with respect to the indices /3 and 11 (inner multiplication by SZ), we obtain the vector A\" = ~ ....

The second term allows itself to be transformed in accordance with (29a). Thus we obtain A .. = 1_ . ~.......,(__,_,./_---=-gA_\"---'iJ) ,./.- g ~X!J .

In the case of symmetry in question, (41) may therefore be replaced by the two forms ~A,.= 3(,./~A:) - t 3gp,, ,.j - gAP\" . (4la) 3x,, 3x,. (41b) which we have to employ later on. § 12. The Riemann-Christoffel Tensor We now seek the tensor which can be obtained from the fundamental tensor alone, by differentiation. At first sight the solution seems obvious. We place the fundamental tensor of the g,.v in (27) instead of any given tensor A,.v, and thus have a new tensor, namely, the extension of the funda- mental tensor. But we easily convince ourselves that this extension vanishes identically. We reach our goal, however, in the following way. In (27) place A,.v = ~A,. - {µv, p}Ap, uXv i.e. the extension of the four-vector A,.. Then (with a some- what different naming of the indices) we get the tensor of the third rank A 32A,. { }3Ap { }3Ap { }3A,. 1£0'T = --- - µ<1', P - - µT, p - - <1'T, p - 3xa3XT 3x,. 3xa 3xp + [ - -a!T {µ<1', p} + {µ-r, a}{a<1', p} + {<1'-r, a}{aµ, p} ]Ap. A. EINSTEIN 141 This expression suggests forming the tensor A,.\" - A,.,,,. For, if we do so, the following terms of the expression for A,..,,.... cancel those of A,.,,,, the first, the fourth, and the member corresponding to the last term in square brackets ; because all these are symmetrical in u and T. The same holds good for the sllm of the second and third terms. Thus we obtain (42) where + {µ,T, a}{au, p} (43) The essential feature of the result is that on the right side of ( 42) the Ap occur alone, without their derivatives. From the tensor character of Aµ.<TT - Awrrr in conjunction with the fact that Ap is an arbitrary vector, it follows, by reason of § 7, that B~O'T is a tensor (the Riemann-Christoffel tensor). The mathematical importance of this tensor is as follows : If the continuum is of such a nature that there is a co-ordinate system with reference to which the g,.v are constants, then all the B~O'T vanish. If we choose any new system of co- ordinates in place of the original ones, the gµ.v referred thereto will not be constants, but in consequence of its tensor nature, the transformed components of B~<TT will still vanish in the new system. Thus the vanishing of the Riemann tensor is a necessary condition that, ·by an appropriate choice of the system of reference, the g,.v may be constants. In our problem this corresponds to the case in which,• with a suitable choice of the system of reference, the special theory of relativity holds good for a finite region of the continuum. Contracting ( 43) with respect to the indices -r and p we obtain the covariant tensor of second rank * The ma.thema.tioia.ns ha.ve proved tha.t this is a.lso a. sufficient condition, 142 THE GENERAL THEORY where R,.,, = - .}-{µ,v, a} + {µ,a, ,8} {v,8, a} ( 44) uX,.

Note on the Choice of Oo-ordinates.-It ha.s already been observed in § 8, in connexion with equation (18a), that the choice of co-ordinates may with advantage be made so that ~ - g = 1. A glance at the equations obtained in the last two sections shows tha.t by such a. choice the laws of forma- tion of tensors undergo an important simplifica.tion. This applies particularly to G,.,,, the tensor just developed, which plays a fundamental part in the theory to be set forth. For this specia.lization of the choice of co-ordinates brings about the vanishing of S,.,,, so that the tensor G,.,, reduces to R,.,,. On this account I shall hereafter give all relations in the simplified form which this specializa.tion of the choice of co- ordinates brings with it. It will then be an easy matter to revert to the generally covariant equations, if this seems desirable in a special case. 0. THEORY OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD § 13. Equations of Motion of a Material Point in the Oravitational Field. Expression for the Field-com- ponents of Oravitation A freely movable body not subjected to external forces moves, a.ccording to the special theory of rela.tivity, in a straight line and uniformly. This is a.lso the case, according to the general theory of relativity, for a. part of four-di- mensiona.l space in which the system of co-ordinates K 0, may be, and is, so chosen that they have the special constant va.lues given in ( 4). If we consider precisely this movement from a.ny chosen system of co-ordinates Ki, the body, observed from Ki, moves, according to the considerations in § 2, in a gravita.tiona.l field. The law of motion with respect to K1 results without diffi- A. EINSTEIN 143 culty from the following consideration. With respect to K 0 the law of motion corresponds to a four-dimensional straight line, i.e. to a geodetic line. Now since the geodetic line is defined independently of the system of reference, its equations will also be the equation of motion of the material point with respect to K1 • If we set (45) the equation of the motion of the point with respect to K1, becomes (46) We now make the assumption, which readily suggests itself, that this covariant system of equations also defines the motion of the point in the gravitational field in the case when there is no system of reference K 0 , with respect to which the special theory of relativity holds good in a finite region. We have all the more justification for this assumption as (46) contains only first derivatives of the g,.., between which even in the special case of the existence of K0, no relations sub- sist.* If the r;,, vanish, then the point moves uniformly in a straight line. These quantities therefore condition the devi- ation of the motion from unifomi.ity. They are the com- ponents of the gravitational field. § 14. The Field Equations of Gravitation in the Absence of Matter We make a distinction hereafter between \"gravitational field\" and \"matter\" in this way, that we denote everything but the gravitational field as \"matter.\" Our use of the word therefore includes not only matter in the ordinary sense, but the electromagnetic field as well. Our next task is to find the field equations of gravitation in the absence of matter. Here we again apply the method * It is only between the second (and first) derivatives that, by § 12, the relations ~OT = 0 subsist. 144 THE GENERAL THEORY employed in the preceding paragraph in formulating the equations of motion of the material point. A special case in which the required equations must in any case be satisfied is that of the special theory of relativity, in which the g,.,, have certain constant values. Let this be the case in a certain finite space in relation to a definite system of co-ordinates K 0• Relatively to this system all the components of the Riemann tensor Bl':.,., defined in (43), vanish. For the space under consideration they then vanish, also in any other system of co-ordinates. Thus the required equations of the matter-free gravita- tional field must in any case be satisfied if all B \":.,. vanish. But this condition goes too far. For it is clear that, e.g., the gravitational field generated by a material point in its environ- ment certainly cannot be \"transformed away \" by any choice of the system of co-ordinates, i.e. it cannot be transformed to the case of constant g,.,,. This prompts us to require for the matter-free gravitational field that the symmetrical tensor G,.,,, derived from the tensor B /,,.,., shall vanish. Thus we obtain ten equations for the ten quantities g,.,,, which are satisfied in the special case of the vanishing of all B~. With the choice which we have made of a system of co-ordinates, and taking (44) into considera- tion, the equations for the matter-free field a.re or;,, r. r{J = o } ox .. + p.{J \"\"' ..J--::-;j = 1 . (47) It must be pointed out that there is only a minimum of arbitrariness in the choice of these equations. For besides G,.,, there is no tensor of second rank which is formed from the g,.,, and its derivatives, contains no derivations higher than second, and is linear in these derivatives.* These equations, which proceed, by the method of pure * Properly speaking, this ca.n be affirmed only of the tensor G,.,, + 11.g,.,,g',./3Ga.f3• where A is a. constant. If, however, we set this tensor .., 0, we come be.ck a.gain to the equations GI\"' = 0. A. EINSTEIN 145 mathematics, from the requireme_!!~ of the general theory of relativity, give us, in combination - with the equations of motion (46), to a first approximation Newton's law of at- traction, and to a second approximation the explanation of the motion of the perihelion of the planet Mercury discovered by Leverrier (as it remains after corrections for perturbation have been ma.de). These facts must, in my opinion, be ta.ken as a convincing proof of the correctness of the theory. § 15. The Hamiltonian Function for the Gravitational Field. Laws of Momentum and Energy To show that the field equations correspond to the laws of momentum and energy, it is most convenient to write them in the following Hamiltonian form :- . (47a.) where, on the boundary of the finite f our-dimensiona,l region of integration which we have in view, the variations vanish. We first have to show that the form (47a.) is equivalent to the equations ( 4 7). For this purpose we regard H as a. function of the g\"• and the g\"; ( = \"i)g,..•/\"i)x\"). Then in the first place oH = r:~~ .. og\"• + 2g\"·r:~o~ .. = - r:~~ .. og\"· + 2r:~ o(g\"·~,,.). But The terms a.rising from the la.st two terms in round brackets a.re of different sign, and result from each other (since the de- nomination of the summation indices is immaterial) through interchange of the indices µ, and fJ. They cancel each other in the expression for 0H1 because they a.re multiplied by the 146 THE GENERAL THEORY quantity T;,13, which is symmetrical with respect to the in· dices µ, and /3. Thus there remains only the first term in round brackets to be considered, so that, taking (31) into ac- count, we obtain Thus i:-H- - ..,.. r/Jog\"v +..,.. i:- ,..,s 0 - .L ji/J Ve> .L l'fJOg .. • 3H = _ I\"' pl } 3gl'V ji{J Ve> 3H 3g:v = Z:v .

EINSTEIN 147 It is to be noticed tha.t t: is not a. tensor ; on the other ha.nd (49) applies to a.11 systems of co-ordinates for which J - g = 1. This equation expresses the la.w of conservation of momentum and of energy for the gravitational field. Actually the integration of this equation over a three- dimensional volume V yields the four equations d!Jt!.dV = J(lt~ + mt! + nt!)dS. . (49a) where l, m, n denote the direction-cosines of direction of the inward dra.wn normal at the element dS of the bounding sur- face (in the sense of Euclidean geometry). We recognize in this the expression of the laws of conservation in their usual form The quantities t; we call the \" energy components \" of the gra.vitationa.1 field. I will now give equations (47) in a. third form, which is pa.rticula.rly useful for a. vivid gra.sp of our subject. By multiplication of the field equations (47) by g'\"' these a.re ob- tained in the \" mixed \" form. Note that which quantity, by res.son of (34), is equal to i)! ..

Thus instead of equations ( 47) we obtain i)!,.(gcr/Jr:./J) = - IC(t; - is:t)} . (51) J -: g = 1 148 THE GENERAL THEORY § 16. The General Form of the Field Equations of Gravitation The field equations for matter-free space formulated in § 15 are to be compared with the field equation 'v2cf, = 0 of Newton's theory. We require the equation corresponding to Poisson's equation '\\12cf, = 41rtcp, where p denotes the density of matter. The special theory of relativity has led to the conclusion that inert mass is nothing more or less tha.n energy, which finds its complete mathematical expression in a symmetrical tensor of second rank, the energy-tensor. Thus in the general theory of relativity we must introduce a correspond- ing energy-tensor of matter T:, which, like the energy-com- ponents tu [equations (49) and (50)] of the gravitational field, will have mixed character, but will pertain to a symmetrical covariant tensor.* The system of equation (51) shows how this energy-tensor (corresponding to the density p in Poisson's equation) is to be introduced into the field equations of gravitation. For if we consider a complete system (e.g. the solar system), the total mass of the system, and therefore its total gravitating action as well, will depend on the total energy of the system, and therefore on the ponderable energy together with the gravitational energy. This will allow itself to be expressed by introducing into (51), in place of the energy-components ol the gravitational field alone, the sums t: + T; of the energy- components of matter and of gravitational field. Thus instead of (51) we obtain the tensor equation \"c)! .. (g .. liT:i9) = - tc[(t: + T:) -· l~:(t + T)],l · (52) J- g= 1 where we have set T = T: (Laue's scalar). These are the • g .. TT; = TO\"T and galiT: = T\"li are to be symmetrical tensors. A. EINSTEIN 149 required genera.I field equations of gravitation in mixed form. Working back from these, we have in place of (47) -a! .. r:. + T;fJ~ .. = - tc(T,.. - ig,..T),} . (53) ~ -g= 1 It must be admitted that this introduction of the energy- tensor of matter is not justified by the relativity postulate alone. For this reason we have here deduced it from the requirement that the energy of the gravitational field shall a.ct gra.vitatively in the same way as any other kind of energy. But the strongest reason for the choice of these equations lies in their consequence, that the equations of conservation of momentum and energy, corresponding exactly to equations (49) and (49a), hold good for the components of the total energy. This will be shown in§ 17. § 17. The Laws of Conservation in the Oeneral Case Equation (52) may readily be transformed so that the second term on the right-hand side vanishes. Contra.ct (52) with respect to the indicesµ, a.nd u, a.nd after multiplying the resulting equation by iB;, subtract it from equation (52). This gives :!-(g\"fJI';fJ - 18:g\"fJr:_fJ) = - tc(t; + T;). (52a) ux .. On this equation we perform the operation c,/\"ilxO'. We have ~(g\"I' ;,.) = - i-()-i -[gcrfJg\"\"(\"i)g,.,. + \"i)gfJA - \"ilg,.fJ)]. \"ilx,.\"ilxcr \"ilx,.\"ilxcr \"ilx11 \"ilx,. \"ilx,. The first and third terms of the round brackets yield con- tributions which cancel one another, as may be seen by interchanging, in the contribution of the third term, the summation· indices a and u on the one hand, and fJ and -;\\. on the other. The second term may be re-modelled by (31), so that we have \"i)2 ( cror\" ) - .l \"i)3gAfJ --g\" fJ --z \"ilx,.\"ilxcr ,. \"ilx,.\"ilxfJ\"ilx,. (54) The second term on the left-hand side of (52a) yields in the 150 THE GENERAL THEORY first place or i~[g\"fJga1,(\"Us>. + cJgsfJ _ \"U\"fJ)]. cJX .. cJX,. cJXfJ cJX>. cJX3 With the choice of co-ordinates which we have ma.de, the term deriving from the last term in round brackets disappears by reason of (29). The other two may be combined, and together, by (31), they give cJ3ga.fJ - t-:-=--:c--4 cJX .. cJXfJcJXi, so that in consideration of (54), we have the identity ~(gPfJI'i,{J - t8';.gAfJr:fJ) = Q cJX .. cJXa- From (55) and (52a), it follows that cJ(ta- + Ta-) ,. ,. - 0 cJXo- - • . (55) . (56) Thus it results from our field equations of gravitation that the laws of conservation of momentum a.nd energy are satisfied. This may be seen most easily from the consider- ation which leads to equation (49a); except that here, instead of the energy components ta- of the gravitational field, we have to introduce the totality of the energy components of matter and gravitational field. · § 18. The Laws of Momentum and Energy for Matter, as a Consequence of the Field Equations Multiplying (53) by \"U\"v/cJxa-, we obtain, by the method adopted in § 15, in view of the vanishing of cJgi,v Ui,v cJXo-' the equatiG>n A. EINSTEIN 151 or, in view of (56), . (57) Comparison with (41b) shows that with the choice of system of co-ordinates which we have made, this equation predicates nothing more or less than the vanishing of di- vergence of the material energy-tensor. Physically, the occurrence of the second term on the left-hand side shows that laws of conservation of momentum and energy do not apply in the strict sense for matter alone, or else that they apply only when the g\"'v are constant, i.e. when the field in- tensities of gravitation vanish. This second term is an ex- pression for momentum, and for energy, as transferred per unit of' volume and time from the gravitational field to matter. This is brought out still more clearly by re-writing (57) in the sense of (41) as (57a) The right side expresses the energetic effect of the gravita- tional field on matter. Thus the field equations of gravitation contain four con- ditions which govern the course of material phenomena.. They give the equations of material phenomena completely, if the latter is capable of being characterized by four differ- ential equations independent of one another.* D. MATERIAL PHENOMENA The mathematical aids developed in part B enable us forthwith to generalize the physical laws of matter (hydro- dynamics, Maxwell's electrodynamics), as they are formulated in the special theory of relativity, so that they will fit in with the general theory of relativity. When this is done, the general principle of relativity does not indeed afford us a further limitation of possibilities; but it makes us acquainted with the influence of the gravitational field on all processes, * On this question cf. H. Hilbert, Na.chr. d. K. Gesellsoh. d. Wiss. zu Gottingen, Ma.th.-phys. Kla.sse, 1915, p. 8. 152 THE GENERAL THEORY without our having to introduce a.ny new hypothesis what- ever. Hence it comes a.bout that it is not necessary to introduce definite assumptions a.s to the physical nature of matter (in the narrower sense). In pa.rticula.r it may remain an open question whether the theory of the electromagnetic field in conjunction with that of the gra.vita.tiona.l field furnishes a. sufficient basis for the theory of matter or not. The general postulate of rela.ti-vity is unable on principle to tell us anything a.bout this. It must remain to be seen, during the working out of the theory, whether electroma.gnetics and the doctrine of gravitation are able in collaboration to perform what the former by itself is unable to do. § 19. Euler's Equations for a Frictionless Adiabatic Fluid Let p and p be two scalars, the former of which we call the \"pressure,\" the latter the \"density \"of a fluid; and let an equation subsist between them. Let the contra.variant symmetrical tensor . (58) be the contrava.ria.nt energy-tensor of the fluid. To it belongs the covariant tensor dxa. dx/3 T,.v = - g,.vp + g,.a.g,./3 ds a;;P, as well a.s the mixed tensor * . ( 58a.) . (58b) Inserting the right-hand side of (58b) in (57a.), we obtain the Eulerian hydrodynamical equations of the genera.I theory of relativity. They give, in theory, a. complete solution of the problem of motion, since the four equations (57a), together * For an observer using a system of reference in the sense of the specie.I theory of. relativity for an infinitely small region, and moving with it, the density of energy T! equals p - p. This gives the definition of p. Thus p is not constant for an incompressible fluid. A.

These are eleven equations for defining the ten functions g,,.v, so that these functions a.ppea.r over-defined. We must remember, however, tha.t the equations (57a.) a.re a.lrea.dy contained in the equations (53), so that the latter represent only seven independent equations. There is good reason for this la.ck of definition, in that the wide freedom of the choice of co-ordinates ca.uses the problem to remain ma.thema.tica.lly undefined to such a. degree that three of the functions of space ma.y be chosen a.t will* § :Jo.

We introduce the contra.variant six-vector associated with F 11li (62) and also the contra.variant vector J\" of the density of the electric current. Then, taking (40) into consideration, the following equations will be invariant for any substitution whose invariant is unity (in agreement with the cliosen co- ordinates) :- Let F23 = H'a:, FH = - E'a:} Fa1 = H'11, F24 = - E'11 F 12 = H'z, F 34 = - E'z .

The equations (60), (62), a.nd (63) thus form the generali- zation of Maxwell's field equations for free space, with the convention which we have established with respect to the choice of co-ordinates.

With the help of (61) and (64), it is ea.sy to show tha.t these energy-components of the electromagnetic field in the case of the special theory of relativity give the well-known Maxwell- Poynting expressions. We have now deduced the general laws which are sa.tisfied by the gravitational field and matter, by consistently using a system of co-ordinates for which ,.;--::-g = 1. We have thereby achieved a considerable simplification of formulm and calculations, without fa.iling to comply with the require- ment of general covariance; for we have drawn our equations from generally covariant equations by specializing the system of co-ordinates. A. EINSTEIN 157 Still the question is not without a formaJ interest, whether with a correspondingly generalized definition of the energy- components of gravitational field and matter, even without specializing the system of co-ordinates, it is possible to formu- late laws of conservation in the form of equation (56), and field equations of gravitation of the same nature as (52) or (52a), in such a.manner that on the left we have a divergence (in the ordinary sense), and on the right the sum of the energy-components of matter and gravitation. I have found that in both cases this is actually so. But I do not think that the communication of my somewhat extensive reflexions on this subject would be worth while, because after all they do not give us anything that is materially new. E § :21. Newton's Theory as a First Approximation As has already been mentioned more than once, the special theory of relativity as a. special case of the general theory is·chara.cterized by the g,.,, having the constant values (4). From what has already been said, this means complete neglect of the effects of gravitation. We arrive at a closer approximation to reality by considering the case where the g,.,, differ from the values of (4) by quantities which a.re small compared with 1, and neglecting small quantities of second and higher order. (First point of view of approximation.) It is further to be assumed that in the space-time territory under consideration the g,.,, at spatial infinity, with a. suitable choice of co-ordinates, tend toward the values (4); i.e. we are considering gravitational fields which may be regarded as generated exclusively by matter in the finite region. It might be thought that these approximations must lead us to Newton's theory. But to that end we still need to ap- proximate the fundamental equations from a second point of view. We give our attention to the motion of a. material point in accordance with the equations (16). In the case of the special theory of relativity the components dx1 dx2 dx 3 ds' ds' di 158 THE GENERAL THEORY may take on any values. This signifies that any velocity V = '(dX1) 2 + (dX2)2 + (dx3) 2 'V dx4 dx 4 dx4 may occur, which is less than the velocity of light in vacuo. If we restrict ourselves to the case which almost exclusively offers itself to our experience, of v being small as compared with the velocity of light, this denotes that the components dx 1 dx2 dx 3 ds' ds' Ts are to be treated as small quantities, while dx4/ds, to the second order of small quantities, is equal to one. (Second point of view of approximation.) Now we remark that from the first point of view of ap- proximation the magnitudes r;,. are all small magnitudes of at least the first order. A glance at ( 46) thus shows that in this equation, from the second point of view of approximation, we have to consider only terms for which µ, = .,, = 4. Re- stricting ourselves to terms of lowest order we first obtain in place of (46) the equations a'x, dt2 = r:.i where we have set ds = dx4 = dt ; or with restriction to terms which from the first point of view of approximation a.re of first order :- d 2x, dtt = (44, T] (T = 1, 2, 3) d2 dt! = - (44, 4]. If in addition we suppose the gravitational field to be a quasi- static field, by confining ourselves to the case where the motion of the matter generating the gravitational field is but slow (in comparison with the velocity of the propagation of light), we may neglect on the right-hand side differentiations with respect to the time in comparison with those with re- spect to the space co-ordinates, so that we have A.

What is remarkable in this result is that the component g44 of the fundamental tensor alone defines, to a first approximation, the motion of the material point. We now turn to the field equations (53). Here we have to take into consideration that the energy-tensor of \"matter \" is almost exclusively defined by the density of matter in the narrower sense, i.e. by the second term of the right-hand side of (58) [or, respectively, (58a.) or (58b)].

From this, however, it is already apparent that other components of the g,,.. must differ from the values given in (4) by small quantities of the first order. This is required by the condition g = - 1.

It is easy to verify that the field equations (outside the mass) are satisfied to the first order of small quantities. We now examine the influence exerted by the field of the mass M upon the metrical properties of spa.ce. The relation ds 2 = g,,.vdx,,.dx •. always holds between the \"locally\" (§ 4) mes.sured lengths and times ds on the one hand, and the differences of co-ordin- ates dx. on the other hand. A. EINSTEIN 161 For a. unit-mea.sure of length laid \" pa.ra.llel \" to the a.xis of x, for exa.mple, we should ha.ve to set ds2 = - 1 ; dx2 = dx8 = dx4 = 0. Therefore - 1 = g11dx:. If, in addition, the unit-measure lies on the a.xis of x, the first of equations (70) gives From these two relations it follows tha.t, correct to a. first order of sma.11 quantities, . (71) The unit measuring-rod thus a.ppea.rs a. little shortened in relation to the system of co-ordinates by the presence of the gra.vita.tiona.l field, if the rod is la.id a.long a. radius. In a.n analogous ma.nner we obta.in the length of co- ordinates in tangential direction if, for example, we set ds2 = - 1; dx1 = dx 3 = dx4 = 0; x1 = r, x 2 = X 3 = 0. The result is - 1 = g22dx! = - dx: . . (71a) With the tangential position, therefore, the gravitational field of the point of mass has no influence on the length of a. rod. Thus Euclidean geometry does not hold even to a first ap- proximation in the gravitational field, if we wish to take one and the same rod, independently of its place and orientation, as a. realization of the same interval ; although, to be sure, a. glance a.t (70a.) a.nd (69) shows tha.t the deviations to be ex- pected a.re much too slight to be noticeable in measurements of the earth's surface. Further, let us examine the ra.te of a unit clock, which is arranged to be a.t rest in a. static gra.vita.tiona.l field. Here we ha.ve for a clock period ds = 1 ; dx1 = dx 2 = dx 3 = 0 Therefore 1 = g44dx!; I 1 dx4 = ,./ g 44 = ,./(I + (g44 _ I)) = 1 - l(g44 - I) 162 THE GENERAL THEORY or . (72) Thus the clock goes more slowly if set up in the neighbour- hood of ponderable masses. From this it follows that the spectral lines of light reaching us from the surface of large stars must appear displaced towards the red end of the spectrum.* We now examine the course of light-rays in the static gravitational field. By the special theory of relativity the velocity of light is given by the equation - dx 1 - dx - dx1 + dx1 = 0 l I I , and therefore by the general theory of relativity by the equation ds 2 = g,..,,dx,.dxv = 0 . (73) If the direction, i.e. the ratio dx1 : dx 2 : dx3 is given, equation (73) gives the quantities dx1 dx 2 dx3 dx,' dx4' dx, and accordingly the velocity f(dXi)2 + (dX2)2 + (dx3) 2 = 'Y 'V dx4 dx4 dx4 defined in the sense of Euclidean geometry. We easily recognize that the course of the light-rays must be bent with regard to the system of co-ordinates, if the g,.v are not con- stant. If n is a direction perpendicular to the propagation of light, the Huyghens principle shows that the light-ray, en- visaged in the plane (,y, n), has-the curvature - <J,y/<Jn. We examine the curvature undergone by a ray of light passing by a mass M at the distance .6,.

HAMILTON'S PRINCIPLE AND THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY BY A. EINSTEIN T HE general theory of relativity has recently been given in a particularly clear form by H. A. Lorentz and D. Hilbert,* who have deduced its equations from one single principle of variation. The same thing will be done in the present paper. But my purpose here is to present the fundamental connexions in as perspicuous a manner as possible, and in as general terms as is per- missible from the point of view of the general theory of relativity. In particular we shall make as few specializing assumptions as possible, in marked contrast to Hilbert's treatment of the subject. On the other hand, in antithesis to my own most recent treatment of the subject, there is to be complete liberty in the choice of the system of co-ordinates. § 1. The Principle of Variation and the Field-equations of Oravitation and Matter Let the gravitational field be described as usual by the tensor t of the g,.,, (or the g\"'\"); and matter, including the electromagnetic field, by any number of space-time functions q<Pl· How these functions may be characterized in the theory of invariants does not concern us.

Likewise it might be imaginable that the qCP> would have to be taken, not as independent of one another, but as connected by conditional equations. All this is of no im- portance for the following developments, as these are based solely on the equations (7), which have been found by vary- ing our integral with respect to the g\"\"· § 3. Properties of the Field Equations of Gravitation Conditioned by the Theory of Invariants We now introduce the assumption that ds2 = g,.,,dx,.dx,, . (9) is an invariant. This determines the transformational char- acter of the g,.,,. As to the transformational character of the q<P>, which describe matter, we make no supposition. On the other hand, let the functions H = {> , as well as .,/ - g 170 HAMILTON'S PRINCIPLE G = @ , and M = ,IDl , be invariants in relation to any ../-g \"\"'-g substitutions of space-time co-ordinates. From these assump- tions follows the genera.I covariance of the equations (7) and (8), deduced from (1). It further follows that G (a.pa.rt from a. constant factor) must be equal to the scalar of Riemann's tensor of curvature; because there is no other invariant with the properties required for G. t Thereby @* is also perfectly determined, and consequently the left-hand side of field equation (7) as well.t · From the genera.I postulate of rela.tivity there follow certain properties of the function@* which we shall now de- duce.

Therefore ~F = 0, and, in consequence, t But the left-hand side of the equation must vanish, since both , ® and ../ - g d-r are invariants. Consequently the \"\" - g right-hand side also vanishes.

EINSTEIN Translated from \" Kosmologische Betrachtungen zur allge- meinen Relativitatstheorie,\" Sitzungsberichte der Preus- sischen Akad. d. Wissenschajten, 1917. COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY BY A. EINSTEIN I T is well known that Poisson's equation 'v2cfi = 4,rKp . . . • (1) in combination with the equations of motion of a. ma.teria.l point is not a.s yet a perfect substitute for Newton's theory of action a.ta. distance. There is still to be ta.ken into account the condition that a.t spa.tie.I infinity the potential cfi tends toward a. fixed limiting value. There is a.n a.na.logous state of things in the theory of gra.vita.tion in genera.I relativity. Here, too, we must supplement the differential equations by limiting conditions a.t spa.tis.I infinity, if we really have to regard the universe a.s being of infinite spa.tie.I extent. In my treatment of the pla.neta.ry problem I chose these limiting conditions in the form of the following assumption: it is possible to select a. system of reference so that a.t spa.tie.I infinity all the gravitational potentials g,.v become constant. But it is by no means evident a priori that we ma.y la.y down the so.me limiting conditions when we wish to take larger portions of the physical universe into consideration. In the following pages the reflexions will be given which, up to the present, I have ma.de on this funda.menta.lly important question. § 1. The Newtonian Theory It is well known that Newton's limiting condition of the constant limit for cfi a.t spa.tie.I infinity leads to the view that the density of matter becomes zero at infinity. For we imagine that there ma.y be a. place in universe.I space round a.bout which the gra.vita.tiona.l field of matter, viewed on a. large sea.le, possesses spherical symmetry. It then follows from Poisson's equation that, in order that cfi may tend to a 177 178 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS limit at infinity, the mea.n density p must decrease toward zero more rapidly than 1/r2 as the distance r from the centre increases.* In this sense, therefore, the universe according to Newton is finite, although it may possess an infinitely great total mass. From this it follows in the first place that the radiation emitted by the heavenly bodies will, in part, leave the Newtonian system of the universe, passing radially outwards, to become ineffective and lost in the infinite. May not entire heavenly bodies fare likewise? It is hardly possible to give a negative answer to this question. For it follows from the assumption of a finite limit for cf> at spatial infinity that a heavenly body with finite kinetic energy is able to reach spatial infinity by overcoming the Newtonian forces of attraction. By statistical mechanics this case must occur from time to time, as long as the total energy of the stellar syst.em-transf erred to one single star-is great enough to send that star on its journey to infinity, whence it never can return. We might try to avoid this peculiar difficulty by assuming a. very high value for the limiting potential at infinity. That would be a possible way, if the value of the gravitational potential were not itself necessarily conditioned by the heavenly bodies. The truth is that we are compelled to regard the occurrence of any great differences of potential of the gravitational field as contradicting the facts. These differences must really be of so low an order of magnitude that the stellar velocities generated by them do not exceed the velocities actually observed. If we apply Boltzmann's law of distribution for gas molecules to the stars, by comparing the stellar system with a gas in thermal equilibrium, we find that the Newtonian stellar system cannot exist at all. For there is a finite ratio of densities corresponding to the finite difference of potentia.l between the centre and spatial infinity. A vanishing of the density at infinity thus implies a vanishing of the density at the centre. * p is the mean density of matter, calculated for a region which is large as compared with the distance between neighbouring fixed stars, but small in comparison with the dimensions of the whole stellar system. A. EINS'l'EIN 179 It seems ha.rdly possible to surmount these difficulties on the ha.sis of the N ewtonia.n theory. We ma.y a.sk ourselves the question whether they ca.n be removed by a, modifica.tion of the N ewtonia.n theory. First of a.11 we will indica.te a, method which does not in itself cla.im to be ta.ken seriously ; it merely serves a,s a, foil for wha.t is to follow. In pla.ce of Poisson's equa.tion we write 'y 2(/> - >..(/;, = 47r1Cp (2) where >.. denotes a, universa.l consta.nt. If Po be the uniform tlensity of a, distribution of ma.ss, then 47T'IC (/> = - ~Po (3) is a. solution of equation (2). This solution would correspond to the case in which the matter of the fixed stars wa.s dis- tributed uniformly through spa.ce, if the density Po is equa.l to the a.ctua.l mean density of the ma.tter in the universe. The solution then corresponds to a.n infinite extension of the centre.I space, filled uniformly with matter. If, without ma.king a.ny change in the mean density, we imagine matter to be non-uniformly distributed locally, there will be, over a.nd a.hove the (/:, with the constant value of equation (3), a.n additional (/;,, which in the neighbourhood of denser masses will so much the more resemble the Newtonian field a.s >..(/;, is sma.ller in comparison with 47r,cp. A universe so constituted would have, with respect to its gra.vita.tional field, no centre. A decrease of density in spa.tie.I infinity would not ha.ve to be assumed, but both the mean potential a.nd mean density would rema.in constant to infinity. The conflict with statistical mechanics which we found in the case of the Newtonian theory is not repeated. With a definite but extremely sma.11 density, matter is in equilibrium, without a.ny internal material forces (pressures) being required to ma.into.in equilibrium. § :i. The Boundary Conditions According to the General Theory of Relativity In the present pa.re.graph I shall conduct the reader over the road that I have myself travelled, rather a rough a.nd winding road, because 9therwise I cannot hope tha.t he will 180 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS ta.ke much interest in the result a.t the end of the journey. The conclusion I shall arrive a.t is that the field equations of gra.vita.tion which I have championed hitherto still need a slight modification, so that on the basis of the general theory of relativity those fundamental difficulties may be avoided which have been set forth in§ 1 as confronting the Newtonian theory. This modification corresponds perfectly to the transi- tion from Poisson's equation (1) to equation (2) of § 1. We finally infer that boundary conditions in spa.tie.I infinity fall a.way altogether, because the universal continuum in respect of its spa.tia.l dimensions is to be viewed a.s a. self-contained continuum of finite spa.tia.l (three-dimensional) volume. The opinion which I entertained until recently, a.s to the limiting conditions to be la.id down in spa.tie.I infinity, took its stand on the following considerations. In a. consistent theory of relativity there ca.n be no inertia. relatively to\" space,\" but only an inertia. of masses relatively to one another. If, therefore, I have a. mass a.t a sufficient distance from all other masses in the universe, its inertia must fall to zero. We will try to formulate this condition mathematically. According to the general theory of relativity the negative momentum is given by the first three components, the energy by the last component of the covariant tensor multiplied by ../--=-ii ,-----;; dxa. m,v - Y g,.°'ds . (4) where, as a.lwa.ys, we set ds2 = g,.,dx,.dx, (5) In the particularly perspicuous case of the possibility of choosing the system of co-ordinates so that the gravitational field a.t every point is spatially isotropic, we have more simply ds2 = - A(dx: + dx: + dx:) + Bdx!. If, moreover, a.t the same time ../ - g = 1 = ../ A 3B we obtain from ( 4), to a first approximation for small velocities·, A. EINS'fEIN 181 for the components of momentum, and for the energy (in the static case) m,v'B. From the expressions for the momentum, it follows that A m .JB plays the part of the rest mass. As m is a constant peculiar to the point of mass, independently of its position, this expression, if we retain the condition .v' g - = 1 at spatial infinity, can vanish only when A diminishes to zero, while B increases to infinity. It seems, therefore, that such a degeneration of the co-efficients g,.,, is required by the postu- late of relativity of all inertia. This requirement implies that the potential energy m.JB becomes infinitely great at infinity. Thus a point of mass can never leave the system; and a more detailed investigation shows that the same thing applies to light-rays. A system of the universe with such behaviour of the gravitational potentials at infinity would not therefore run the risk of wasting a.way which was mooted just now in connexion with the Newtonian theory. I wish to point out that the simplifying assumptions as to the gravitational potentials on which this reasoning is based, have been introduced merely for the sake of lucidity. It is possible to find general formulations for the behaviour of the g,.,, at infinity which express the essentials of the question without further restrictive assumptions. At this stage, with the kind assistance of the mathe- matician J. Grommer, I investigated centrally symmetrical, static gravitational fields, degenerating at infinity in the way mentioned. The gravitational potentials g,.,, were applied, and from them the energy-tensor T,.,, of matter was calculated on the basis of the field equations of gravitation. But here it proved that for the system of the fixed stars no boundary con- ditions of the kind can come into question at all, as was also rightly emphasized by the astronomer de Sitter recently. For the contra.variant energy-tensor T\"\" of ponderable matter is given by T\"\" = pdx,. dx,,, ds ds where pis the density of matter in natural measure. With 182 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS an appropriate choice of the system of co-ordinates the stellar velocities are very small in comparison with that of light. We may, therefore, substitute Jg44 dx4 fords. This shows us that all components of T\"v must be very small in comparison with the last component T 44 • But it was quite impossible to reconcile this condition with thechosen boundary conditions. · In the retrospect this result does not appear astonishing. The fact of the small velocities of the stars allows the conclusion that wherever there are fixed stars, the gravitational potential (in our case JB) can never be much greater than here on earth. This follows from statistical reasoning, exactly as in the case of the Newtonian theory. At any rate, our calculations have convinced me that such conditions of degeneration for the g,.v in spatial infinity may not be postulated. After the failure of this attempt, two possibilities next present themselves. (a) We may require, as in the problem of the planets, that, with a suitable choice of the system of reference, the g,.v in spatial infinity approximate to the values - 1 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 0 0 1 (b) We may refrain entirely from laying down boundary conditions for spatial infinity claiming general validity; but at the spatial limit of the domain under consideration we have to give the g,.v separately in each individual case, as hitherto we were accustomed to give the initial conditions for time separately. The possibility (b) holds out no hope of solving the prob- lem, but amounts to giving it up. This is an incontestable position, which is taken up at the present time by de Sitter.• But I must confess that such a complete resignation in this fundamental question is for me a difficult thing. I should not make up my mind to it until every effort to make head- way toward a satisfactory view had proved to be vain. Possibility (a) is unsatisfactory in more respects than one. \"de Sitter, Ake.cl. va.n Wetensch. te Amsterda.m, 8 Nov., 1916. A. EINSTEIN 183 In the first place those boundary conditions pre-suppose a definite choice of the system of reference, which is contrary to the spirit of the relativity principle. Secondly, if we adopt this view, we fail to comply with the requirement of the relativity of inertia. For the inertia of a material point of mass m (in natural measure) depends upon the g,.v ; but these differ but little from their postulated values, as given above, for spatial infinity. Thus inertia would indeed be influenced, but would not be conditioned by matter (present in finite space). If only one single point of mass were present, according to this view, it would possess inertia, and in fact an inertia almost as great as when it is surrounded by the other masses of the actual universe. Finally, those statistical objections must be raised against this view which were mentioned in respect of the Newtonian theory. From what has now been said it will be seen that I have not succeeded in formulating boundary conditions for spatial infinity. Nevertheless, there is still a possible way out, without resigning as suggested under (b ). For if it were possible to regard the universe as a continuum which is finite (closed) with respect to its spatial dimensions, we should have no need at all of any such boundary conditions. We shall proceed to show that both the general postulate of relativity and the fact of the small stellar velocities are com- patible with the hypothesis of a spatially finite universe ; though certainly, in order to carry through this idea, we need a generalizing modification of the field equations of gravitation. § .3. The Spatially Finite Universe with a Uniform Distribution of Matter According to the general theory of relativity the metrical character (curvature) of the four-dimensional space-time con- tinuum is defined at every point by the matter at that point and the state of that matter. Therefore, on account of the lack of uniformity in the distribution of matter, the metrical structure of this continuum must necessarily be extremely complicated. But if we are concerned with the structure only on a large scale, we may represent matter to ourselves as being uniformly distributed over enormous spaces, so that its density of distribution is a variable function which varies 184 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS extremely slowly. Thus our procedure will somewhat re- semble that of the geodesists who, by means of an ellipsoid, approximate to the shape of the earth's surface, which on a small scale is extremely complicated. The most important fact that we draw from experience as to the distribution of matter is that the relative velocities of the stars a.re very small as compared with the velocity of light. So I think that for the present we may base our reasoning upon the following approximative assumption. There is a system of reference relatively to which matter may be looked upon as being permanently at rest. With respect to this system, therefore, the contra.variant energy- tensor T\"\" of matter is, by reason of (5), of the simple form 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 p } (6) The scalar p of the (mean) density of distribution may be a priori a function of the space co-ordinates. But if we assume the universe to be spatially finite, we are prompted to the hypothesis that p is to be independent of locality. On this hypothesis we base the following considerations. As concerns the gravitational field, it follows from the equation of motion of the material point d 2x. { fJ }dxa. dxtJ = 0 ds 2 + a ' .,, ds ds that a material point in a static gravitational field can remain at rest only when g44 is independent of locality. Since, further, we presuppose independence of the time co-ordma.te x4 for all magnitudes, we may demand for the required solution that, for all x., . (7) Further, as always with static problems, we shall have to set Y14 = Y24 = Ys4 = 0 . (8) It remains now to determine those components of the gravitational potential which define the purely spatial-geo- metrical relations of our continuum (g11,g121 • • • g33 ). From A. EINSTEIN 185 our assumption as to the uniformity of distribution of the masses generating the field, it follows that the curvature of the required space must be constant. With this distribution of mass, therefore, the required finite continuum of the xi, x2, x3, with constant x4, will be a spherical space. We arrive at such a space, for example, in the following way. We start from a Euclidean space of four dimensions, E1, E2, Ea E4, with a linear element du; let, therefore, du2 = a(i + ae: + a(a + dE: (9) In this space we consider the hyper-surface R2 = E: + E: + ta + E:, · . (10) where R denotes a constant. The points of this hyper-surface form a three-dimensional continuum, a spherical space of radius of curvature R. The four-dimensional Euclidean space with which we started serves only for a convenient definition of our hyper- surface. Only those points of the hyper-surface are of interest to us which have metrical properties in agreement with those of physical space with a uniform distribution of matter. For the description of this three-dimensional con- tinuum we may employ the co-ordinates E1, Es, Ea (the pro- jection upon the hyper-plane E4 = 0) since, by reason of (10), E4 can be expressed in terms of E1, E2 , E3 • -Eliminating E4 from (9), we obtain for the linear element of the spherical space the expression du2 = ,Y1.wdE,,.dEv } ~ E,,.Ev . (11) 'Y11-v = Op.v + R~ 2 - p where S,,.v = 1, ifµ. = v; S,,.v = 0, ifµ. =f= v, and p2 = (i + E: + E:. The co-ordinates chosen are convenient when it is a question of examining the environment of one of the two points E1 = E2 = Ea = o. Now the linear element of the required four-dimensional space-time universe is also given us. For the potential g,,.v, both indices of which differ from 4, we have to set (12) 186 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS which equation, in combination with (7) and (8), perfectly defines the behaviour of measuring-rods, clocks, and light- rays. § 4. On an Additional Term for the Field Equations of Gravitation My proposed field equations of gravitation for any chosen system of co-ordinates run as follows :- G,.v = - i)! .. {µ.v, a} + {µ.a, fJ} {vfJ, a} _ (13) G ,.v = - tc{T,.v - fg,.vT), } i)2log .J - g { }i) log .J - g + - µ.v, a -~~~ i)x,.i)xv i)x .. The system of equations (13) is by no means satisfied when we insert for the g,.v the values given in (7), (8), and (12), a.nd for the (contra.variant) energy-tensor of matter the values indicated in (6} It will be shown in the next para.- graph how this calculation may conveniently be ma.de. So that, if it were certain that the field equations (13) which I have hitherto employed were the only ones compatible with the postulate of general relativity, we should probably have to conclude that the theory of relativity does not admit the hypothesis of a spatially finite universe. However, the system of equations (14) allows a readily suggested extension which is compatible with the relativity postulate, and is perfectly analogous to the extension of Poisson's equation given by equation (2). For on the left. hand side of field equation (13) we may add the fundamental tensor g,.v, multiplied by a universal constant, - A, at present unknown, without destroying the general covariance. In place of field equation (13) we write G,.v - Af11&v = - tc(T,.v - ig,.vT) , , (13a) This field equation, with ]\\. sufficiently small, is in any case also compatible with the facts of experience derived from the solar system. It also satisfies laws of conservation of momentum and energy, because we arrive at (13a) in place of (13) by introducing into Hamilton's principle, instead of the scalar of Riemann's tensor, this scalar increased by a. A. EINSTEIN 187 universal constant ; and Hamilton's principle, of course, guarantees the validity of laws of conservation. It will be shown in § 5 -that field equation (13a) is compatible with our conjectures on field and matter. § 5. Calculation and ~esult Since all points of our continuum are on a.n equal footing, it is sufficient to carry through the calculation for one point, e.g. for one of the two points with the co-ordinates X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 0. Then for the g,.v in (13a) we have to insert the values - 1 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 0 0 1 wherever they appear differentiated only once or not at all We thus obtain in the first place - ~ ~ ] ~ i)2log ..; - g G,.. - i) [µ.v, I] + i) [µ.v, 2 + i) [µ.v, 3] + . X1 X2 X3 i):x,.i)xv From this we readily discover, taking (7), (8), and (13) into account, that all equations (13a) are satisfied if the two relations 2 \"P \"P - R2 + A = - 2' - A = - 2' or . (14) are fulfilled. Thus the newly introduced universal constant A defines both the mean density of distribution p which can remain in equilibrium and also the radius R and the volume 2,r2R3 of spherical space. The total mass M of the universe, accord- ing to our view, is finite, and is in fa.ct M = p . 2,r2Ra = 4,r2- = ,r2 32 . R ~- \" ,c3p . (15) Thus the theoretical view of the actual universe, if it is in correspondence with orir reasoning, is the following. The 188 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS curva.ture of space is variable in time and place, according to the distribution of matter, but we may roughly approximate to it by means of a spherical space. At any rate, this view is logically consistent, and from the standpoint of the general theory of relativity lies nearest at hand ; whether, from the standpoint of present astronomical knowledge, it is tenable, will not here be discussed. In order to arrive at this con- sistent view, we admittedly had to introduce an extension of the field equations of gravitation which is not justified by our actual knowledge of gravitation. It is to be emphasized, however, that a positive curvature of space is given by our results, even if the supplementary term is not introduced. That term is necessary only for the purpose of making possible a quasi-static distribution of matter, as required by the fa.ct of the small velocities of the stars.

DO GRAVITATION~L FIELDS PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE ELEMEN- TARY PARTICLES OF MATTER? BY A. EINSTEIN N EITHER the Newtonian nor the relativistic theory of gravitation has so far led to any advance in the theory of the constitution of matter. In view of this fact it will be shown in the following pages that there are reasons for thinking that the elementary formations which go to make up the atom are held together by gravitational forces. § 1. Defects of the Present View Great pa.ins have been taken to elaborate a theory which will account for the equilibrium of the electricity constituting the electron. G. Mie, \"in particular, has devoted deep re- searches to this question. His theory, which has found con- siderable support among theoretical physicists, is based mainly on the introduction into the energy-tensor of sup- plementary terms depending on the components of the electro-dynamic potential, in addition to the energy terms of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory. These new terms, which in outside space are unimportant, are nevertheless effective in the interior of the electrons in maintaining equilibrium against the electric forces of repulsion. In spite of the beauty of the formal structure of this theory, as erected by Mie, Hilbert, and Weyl, its physical results have hitherto been unsatisfactory. On the one hand the multiplicity of possibilities is discouraging, and on the other hand those additional terms have not as yet allowed themselves to be framed in such a simple form that the solution could be satisfactory. 191 192 ATOMIC STRUCTURE So far the genera.I theory of relativity has ma.de no change in this state of the question. If we for the moment disregard the additional cosmological term, the field equations take the form . (1) where G,.v denotes the contracted Riemann tensor of curva- ture, G the scalar of curvature formed by repeated contraction, and T,.v the energy-tensor of \"matter.\" The assumption that the T,.v do not depend on the derivatives of the g,.v is in keeping with the historical development of these equations. For these quantities are, of course, the energy-components in the sense of the special theory of relativity, in which variable g,.v do not occur. The second term on the left-hand side of the equation -is so chosen that the divergence of the left- ha.nd side of (1) vanishes identically, so that ta.king the divergence of (1), we obtain the equation . (2) which in the limiting case of the special theory of relativity gives the complete equations of conservation <>T,.v = O. <>xv Therein lies the physical foundation for the second term of the left-hand side of (1). It is by no means settled a priori that a. limiting transition of this kind has any possible mean- ing. For if gravitational fields do play a.n essential pa.rt in the structure of the particles of matter, the transition to the limiting case of constant g,.v would, for-them, lose its justifi- cation, for indeed, with constant g,.v there could not be any particles of matter. So if we wish to contemplate the possi- bility that gravitation may take part in the structure of the fields which constitute the corpuscles, we cannot regard equation (1) as confirmed. Placing in (1) the Maxwell-Lorentz-energy-components of the electromagnetic field cf,,.v, . (3) A. EINSTEIN 193 we obtain for (2), by taking the divergence, and after some reduction,* tf,,,.a'J\" = 0 where, for brevity, we have set 'i) - 'i)f\" .. :;;---(-./ - g \"',,..g\"'\" g• .. ) = ~ = 3\" vX, 't' vX,. . (4) . (5) In the calculation we have employed the second of Maxwell's systems of equations 'i)tf,,,.. + 'i)tf,.p + 'i)tf,pp. = 0 . (6) 'i)xP 'i)x,,. 'i)x. We see from ( 4) that the current-density 3\" must everywhere vanish. Therefore, by equation (1), we cannot arrive a.t a theory of the electron by restricting ourselves to the electro- magnetic components of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, as has long been known. Thus if we hold to (1) we are driven on to the pa.th of Mie's theory.t Not only the problem of matter, but the cosmological problem as well, leads to doubt as to equation (1). As I have shown in the previous paper, the genera.I theory of relativity requires that the universe be spatially finite. But this view of the universe necessitated a.n extension of equations (1), with the introduction of a new universal constant 1'., standing in a, fixed relation to the total mass of the universe ( or, re- spectively, to the equilibrium density of matter). This 1s gravely detrimental to the formal beauty of the theory. § :2. The Field Equations Freed of Scalars The difficulties set forth above are removed by setting in place of field equations (1) the field equations G,,.. - fg,..G = - ,cT,,.. .

If we had reasoned on the basis of equations (1) instead of (la), we should, on the contrary, have obtained the condition G = 0, which would have to hold good everywhere for the g,.., independently of the electric field. It is clear that the system of equations [(la), (3)] is a consequence of the system [(1), (3)], but not conversely. We might at first sight feel doubtful whether (la) together with (6) sufficiently define the entire field. In a generally relativistic theory we need n - 4 differential equations, in- dependent of one another, for the definition of n independent variables, since in the solution, on account of the liberty of choice of the co-ordinates, four quite arbitrary functions of all co-ordinates must naturally occur. Thus to define the sixteen independent quantities g,.. and ¢,.. we require twelve equations, all independent of one another. But as it happens, nine of the equations (la), and three of the equations (6) a.re independent of one another. Forming the divergence of (la), and taking into account that the divergence of G,.. - }g,..G vanishes, we obtain ,,. J\" 1 ~G O 'i\"\"\" + 4-::.----- = IC uXcr (4a.) From this we recognize first of all that the scalar of curvature G in the four-dimensional domains in which the density of electricity vanishes, is constant. If we assume that all these parts of space are connected, and therefore that the density of electricity differs from zero only in separate \"world- threads,\" then the scalar of curvature, everywhere outside these world-threads, possesses a. constant value G 0 • But equation (4a) also allows an important conclusion as to the behaviour of G within the domains having a density of elec- tricity other than zero. If, as is cust9mary, we regard elec- tricity as a moving density of charge, by setting . (7) A. EINSTEIN 195 we obtain from (4a.) by inner multiplication by Jo-, on account of the antisymmetry of c/,,.v, the relation :: ~O\" = 0 . (8) Thus the scalar of curvature is constant on every world-line of the motion of electricity. Equation ( 4a) can be interpreted in a graphic manner by the statement : The scalar of curva- ture plays the part of a negative pressure which, outside of the electric corpuscles, has a constant value Gu, In the in- terior of every corpuscle there subsists a negative pressure (positive G - Gu) the fall of which maintains the electro- dynamic force in equilibrium. The minimum of pressure, or, respectively, the maximum of the scalar of curvature, does not change with time in the interior of the corpuscle. We now write the field equations (la) in the form (G,.v - ig,.vG) + fg,.vGu = - \"( T,.v + i,l,.v(G - Gu)) (9) On the other ha.nd, we transform the equations supplied with the cosmological term as already given G,.v - Xg,.v = - 1'(T,.v - fg,.vT). Subtracting the scalar equation multiplied by t, we next obtain (G,.v - tg,.vG) + g,.v\"71. = - \"T,.v, Now in regions where only electrical and gravitational fields a.re present, the right-hand side of this equation vanishes. For such regions we obtain, by forming the scalar, - G + 4\"71. = 0. In such regions, therefore, the scalar of curvature is constant, so that X may be replaced by iGu, Thus we may write the earlier field equation (1) in the form G,.v - fg,.vG + fg,.vGu = - 1'T,.v , , (10) Comparing (9) with (10), we see that there is no difference between the new field equations and the earlier ones, except that instead of T,.v a.s tensor of \" gravitating mass \" there now 196 ATOMIC STRUCTURE 1 occurs T,.v + 41' g,.v(G - G 0 ) which is independent of the scalar of curvature. But the new formulation has this great advantage, that the quantity>.. appears in the fundamental equations as a constant of ip.tegra.tion, and no longer as a universal constant peculiar to the fundamental law. § 3. On the Cosmological Question The last result already permits the surmise that with our new formulation the universe may be regarded as spatially finite, without any necessity for an additional hypothesis. As in the preceding paper I shall again show that with a uniform distribution of matter, a spherical world is compatible with the equations. In the first place we set ds 2 = - ,YikdXidXk + dx! (i, k = 1, 2, 3) (11) Then if Pik and Pare, respectively, the curvature tensor of the second rank and the curvature scalar in three-dimensional space, we have Gik = Pik (i, k = 1, 2, 3) Gi4 = G4i = G 44 = 0 G = - P - g = 'Y· It therefore follows for our case that Gik - igikG = Pik - i'YikP (i, k = 1, 2, 3) G44 - tg44G = tP. We pursue our reflexions, from this point on, in two ways. Firstly, with the support of equation (la). Here T,.v denotes the energy-tensor of the electro-magnetic field, arising from the electrical particles constituting matter. For this field we have everywhere ~! + ~= + x: + ~: = 0. The individual ~: are quantities which vary rapidly with posi- tion ; but for our purpose we no doubt may replace them by their mean values. We therefore have to choose ~! = ~: = ~: = - !X: = const.} . (l2) ~; = 0 (forµ, =I= v), A. EINS'fEIN 197 and therefore ~· ~· '11ik = ! ../~ \"lik, T\" = ..;;· In consideration of what has been shown hitherto, we obta.in in place of (la) \"~' p ik - l'YikP = - t\"lik-' . ../\"1 (18) (14) The sca.la.r of equation (13) agrees with (14). It is on this account that our fundamental equations permit the idea of a spherical universe. For from (13) and (14) follows 4 \"~· Pik + - -'\"lik = 0 '3 ...J,y . (15) and it is known* that this system is satisfied by a (three- dimensional) spherical universe. But we may also base our reflexions on the equations (9). On the right-hand side of (9) stand those terms which, from the phenomenological point of view, a.re to be replaced by the energy-tensor of matter; that is, they are to be replaced by 0 0 0 0 o· o o o 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 p where p denotes the mean density of matter assumed to be a.t rest. We thus obtain the equations Pik - i'YikP - i'YikG0 = 0 . (16) iP + !Go = - \"P . (17) From the scalar of equation (16) and from (17) we obtain G0 = - JP = 2,cp, (18) and consequently from (16) Pik - \"P'Yik = O. (19) *Cf. H. Weyl, \"Ra.um, Zeit, Materie,\" § 33. 198 ATOMIC STRUCTURE which equation, with the exception of the expression for the co-efficient, agrees with (15). By comparison we obtain (20) This equation signifies that of the energy constituting matter three-quarters is to be ascribed to the electroma.gn-etic field, and one-quarter to the gravitational field. § 4. Concluding Remarks The above reflexions show the possibility of a theoretical construction of matter out of gravitational field and electro- magnetic field a.lone, without the introduction of hypothetical supplementary terms on the lines of Mie's theory. This possibility appears particularly promising in that it frees us from the necessity of introducing a. special constant 'X for the solution of the cosmological problem. On the other hand, there is a peculiar difficulty. For, if we specialize (1) for the spherically symmetrical static case we obtain one equation too few for defining the g,,.v and cf,,.., with the result that any spherically symmetrical disflribution of electricity appears capable of remaining in equilibrium. Thus the problem of the constitution of the elementary quanta. cannot yet be solved on the immediate ha.sis of the given field equations. GRAVITATION AND ELECTRICITY BY H. WEYL Translated from \" Gravitation und Elektriticitat,\" Sitzungs- berichte der Preussischen A.kad. d. Wissenschaften, 1918. GRAVITATION AND ELECTRICITY* BY H. WEYL A CCORDING to Riemann,t geometry is based upon the following two facts :- 1. Space is a Three-dimensional Continuum.-The manifold of its points may therefore be consistently repre- sented by the values of three co-ordinates x1, x2, x3• 2. (Pythagorean Theorem) .-The square of the distance ds between two infinitely proximate points P = (x1, x2, x3) and P' = (x1 + dxi, x2 + dx2, X3 + dx3) (1) (any co-ordinates being employed) is a quadratic form of the relative co-ordinates dx,,. :- . (2) ,,.,, The second of these facts may be briefly stated by saying that space is a metrical continuum. In complete accord with the spirit of the physics of immediate action we assume the Pythagorean theorem to be strictly valid only in the limit when the distances are infinitely small The special theory of relativity led to the discovery that time is associated as a fourth co-ordinate (x4) on an equal footing with the three co-ordinates of space, and that the scene of material events, the world, is therefore a four-dimen- sional, metrical continuum. And so the quadratic form (2), which defines the metrical properties of the world, is not necessarily positive as in the case of the geometry of three- dimensional space, but has the index of inertia 3.+ Riemann * The footnotes in square brackets a.re le.tar additions by the author, +Me.th.

Until then all geometricians and philosophers had looked upon the metrical properties of space as pertaining to space itself, in- dependently of the matter which it contained. It is upon this idea, which it was quite impossible for Riemann in his day to carry through, that Einstein in our own time, independently of Riemann, has raised the imposing edifice of his general theory of relativity. According to Einstein the phenomena of gravitation must also bepla.ced to the account of geometry, and the laws by which matter affects measurements are no other than the laws of gravitation : the g,.v in (2) form the components of the gravitational potential While the gravi- tational potential thus consists of an invariant quadratic differential form, electromagnetic phenomena are governed by a four-potential of which the components cf>,. together com- pose an invariant linear differential form ~,;f,,.dx,.. But so far the two classes of phenomena, gravitation and electricity, stand side by side, ·the one separate from the other. The later work of Levi-Civita,* Hessenberg,t and the author+ shows quite plainly that the fundamental conception on which the development of Riemann's geometry must be based if it is to be in agreement with nature, is that of the infinitesimal parallel displacement of a vector. If P and P* are any two points connected by a curve, a given vector at P can be moved parallel to itself along this curve from P to P*. But, generally speaking, this conveyance of a vector from P to P* is not integrable, that is to say, the vector at P* at which we arrive depends upon the path along which the dis- placement travels. It is only in Euclidean \" gravitationless\" geometrythatintegrabilityobtains. TheRiemanniangeometry referred to above stiU contains a residua.I element of finite geometry-without any substantial reason, as far as I can see. * \"Nozione di para.llelismo .•. \", Rend. del Circ.

WEYL 203 It seems to be due to the accidental origin of this geometry in the theory of surfaces. The quadratic form (2) enables us to compare, with respect to their length, not only two vectors at the same point, but also the vectors at any two points. But a truly infinitesimal geometry must recognize only the principle of the transference of a length from one point to another point infinitely near to the first. This forbids us to assume that the problem of the transference of length from one point to another at a. finite distance is integrable, more particularly as the problem of the transference of direction has proved to be non-integrable. Such an assumption being re- cognized as false, a geometry comes into being, which, when applied to the world, explains in a surprising manner not only the phenomena of gravitation, but also those of the elec- tromagnetic field. According to the theory which now takes shape, both classes of phenomena. spring from the same source, and in fact we cannot in general make any arbitrary separation of electricity from gravitation. In this theory all physical quantities have a meaning in world geometry. In particular the quantities denoting physical effects appear at once as pure numbers. The theory leads to a world-law which in its essentials is defined without ambiguity. It even permits us in a certain sense to comprehend why the world has four dimensions. I shall now first of all give a sketch of the structure of the amended geometry of Riemann without any thought of its physical interpretation. Its application to physics will then follow of its own accord. In a given system of co-ordinates the relative co-ordinates dx,. of a point P infinitely near to P-see (1)-are the com- ponents of the infinitesimal displacement PP'. The transition from one system of co-ordinates to another is expressed by definite formulre of transformation, x,. = x,.(x:, x; ... x:) µ, = 1, 2, ... n, which determine the connexion between the co-ordinates of the same point in the two systems. Then between the com- ponents dx,. and the components dx; of the same infinitesimal displacement of the point P we have the linear formulre of transformation dx,. = Za,.,dx: (3) II 204 GRAVITATION AND ELECTRICITY in which a,.,, are the values of the derivatives ~x: a.t the point uX,, P.

It is, firstly, linear or affine, i.e. by multiplication of a. vector at P by a. number,. and by addition of two such vectors, there always a.rises a vector at P ; and, secondly, it is metrical, i.e. by the sym- metrical bilinear form belonging to (2) a. scalar product X • Y = Y . X = ~g,.,,f\"Tj\" \"\" is invariantly assigned to each pair of vectors x and y with components E\", \"I\"· We take it, however, that this form is determined only as far as to a positive factor of proportion- ality, which remains arbitrary. If the manifold of points of space is represented by co-ordinates x,., the g,.,, are determined by the metrical properties at the point P only to the extent of their proportionality. In the physical sense, too, it is only the ratios of the g,.,, that has an immediate tangible meaning. For the equation 'Zg,.,,dx,.dx,, = 0 \"\" is satisfied, when P is a given origin, by those infinitely proximate world-points which a.re reached by a light signal emitted at P. For the purpose of analytical presentation we have firstly to choose a. definite system of co-ordinates, and secondly at each point P to determine the arbitrary factor of proportionality with which the g,.,, a.re endowed. Accordingly the formulre which emerge must possess a double property of invariance: they must be invariant with respect to any con- tinuous transformations of co-ordinates, and they must remain unaltered if )..g,.,,, where ).. is an arbitrary continuous function of position, is substituted for the g,.,,. The supervention of this second property of in-variance is characteristic of our theory. If P, P• are any two points, and if to each vector x at P a. vector x• at p• is assigned in such a way that in general ax H. WEYL 205 becomes ax*, and x + y becomes x* + y* (a. being any as- signed number), and the vector zero at P is the only one to which the vector zero at P* corresponds, we then have made an affine or linear replica of the vector-space a.t P on the vector- space at P*. This replica has a particularly close resemblance when the scalar prod11ct of the vectors x*, y* at P* is propor- tional to that of x and y at P for all pairs of vectors x, y. (In our view it is only this idea of a similar replica that has an objective sense ; the previous theory permitted the more definite conception of a congruent replica.) The meaning of the parallel displacement of a. vector at the point P to a neighbouring point P' is settled by the two axiomatic postu- lates. 1. By the parallel displacement of the vectors at the point P to the neighbouring point P' a similar image of the vector- space at Pis made upon the vector-space at P'. 2. If P 1, P 2 are two points in the neighbourhood of P, and the infinitesimal vector PP 2 at Pis transformed into P 1P 12 by a parallel displacement to the point P 1, while PP1 at P is transformed into P 2P 21 by parallel displacement to P 2 , then P 12, P 21 coincide, i.e. infinitesimal parallel displacements a.re commutative. That part of postulate 1 which says that the parallel dis- placement is an affine transposition of the vector-space from P to P', is expressed analytically as follows: the vector E\" at P = (xi, x2 , •• xn) is by displacement transformed into a vector E\" + dE\" at P' = (x1 + dx1, x2 + dx2, ••• Xn + dxn) the components of which are in a linear relation to E\",- (4) ,, The second postulate teaches that the drf,, ,are linear differ- ential forms dry: = l'~pdXp, p the coefficients of which possess the symmetrical property .

The internal metrical conneroion of space thus depends on a linear form (7) besides the quadratic form (2}-which is determined except as to an arbitrary factor of proportionality.* If we substitute Xg,.,, for g,.v with- * [I have now modified this structure in the following points (of. the fine.I presentation in ed. 4 of\" Ra.um, Zeit, Ma.terie,\" 1921, §§ 13, 18). (a) In pla.oe of postulates 1 a.nd 2, which the pa.ra.llel displacement ha.s to fulfil, there is now one postulate: Let there be a. system of co-ordinates a.t the point P, by the employment of which the components of every vector a.t P a.re not altered by pa.re.Ile! displacement to a.ny point in infinite proximity to P. This postu- late characterizes the essence of the pa.re.lie! displacement a.s that of a. trans- position, concerning which it ma.y be correctly asserted that it leaves the vectors \"unaltered.\" (b) To the metrics at the single point P, according to which there is attached to every vector x = (' a.t P a. tract of such a kind that two vectors define the same tract when, and only when, they possess the sa.me measure-number Z = -:1.g,,_vf\"'Ev, there must now be added the metrioa.l con- nexion of P with the points in its neighbourhood : by congruent transposition to the infinitely near point P' a. tract at P passes over into a definite tract a.t P'. If we make a requirement of this concept of congruent transposition of tra.ots analogous to that which has just been postulated, under (a), of the concept of parallel displacement of vectors, we see that this process (in which the measure- number Z of the tract is increased by dZ) is expressed in the equations dl = Zdq, j dq> = ';1.q>,,_da:,..

Equation (6) then shows that def, becomes dA def, + )\\.- = def> + d (log A), What remains undetermined, therefore, in the linear form ~cf;,.dx,. is not a factor of proportionality which would have to be settled by an arbitrary choice of a unit of measurement, but, rather, the arbitrary element inherent in it consists in an additive total differential. For the analytical representation of geometry the forms g,.,dx,.dx,, cf>,.dx,.. are on an equal footing with X. g,.,dx,.dx, and cf>,.dx,. + d (log X) (8) . (9) where A is any positive function of position. Hence there is invariant significance in the anti-symmetrical tensor with the components . (10) i.e. the form which depends bilinearly on two arbitrary displacements d.x and ix at the point P-or, rather, depends linearly on the surface element with the components ~x,.. = dx,.ix. - dx,Sx,. which is defined by these two displacements. The special case of the theory as hitherto developed, in which the arbitrarily chosen unit of length at the origin allows itself to be transferred . by parallel displacement to all points of space in a manner which is independent of the path traversed -this special case occurs when the g,.. can be absolutely determined in such a way that the cf>,. vanish. The r:P are In these circumstances the metrics a.nd the metrical connexion determine the \" a.ffine\" connexion (pa.ra.llel displa.cement} without a.mbiguity-a.nd indeed, according to my present view of the problem of spa.ca this is the most funda.- menta.l fa.ct of geometry-whereas according to the presentation given in the text it is the linear form dip tha.t rems.ins a.rbitra.ry in the given metrics a.t the pa.ra.llel displacement.] · 208 GRAVITATION AND ELECTRICITY then nothing else than the Christoffel three-indices symbols. The necessary and sufficient invariant condition for the occurrence of this case consists in the identical vanishing of the tensor F ,..,,. This naturally suggests interpreting cf,,. in world-geometry as the four-potential, and the tensor F consequently as electro- magnetic field. For the absence of an electromagnetic field is the necessary condition for the validity of Einstein's theory, which, up to the present, accounts for the phenomena. of gravitation only. If this view is accepted, it will be seen that the electric quantities are of such a nature that their char- acterization by numbers in a definite system of co-ordinates does not depend on the arbitrary choice of a, unit of measure- ment. In fa.ct, in the question of the unit of measurement and of dimension there must be a new orientation of the theory. Hitherto a quantity has been spoken of as, e.g., a tensor of the second rank, if a single value of the quantity determines a. matrix of numbers a,.v in ea.ch system of co- ordinates after an arbitrary unit of measurement has been selected, these numbers forming the coefficients of an in- variant bilinear form of two arbitrary, infinitesimal displace- ments . (11) But here we speak of a tensor, if, with a system of co-ordin- ates taken as a base, and after definite selection of the factor of proportionality contained in the g,.., the components a,.v are determined without ambiguity and in such a way that on transforming the co-ordinates the form (11) remains invariant, but on replacing g,.. by Xg,.. the a,.v become xea,.v, We then say that the tensor has the weight e, or, ascribing to the linear element ds the dimension \"length = l,\" that it is of dimension l 28• Only those tensors of weight Oare absolutely invariant. The field tensor with the components F ,.vis of this kind. By (10) it satisfies the first system of the Maxwell equations <>F,p + <>Fp,, + <>F,,. = O. <lz,, <lx, <lXp When once the idea, of parallel displacement is clear, geometry and the tensor calculus can be established without difficulty. H. WEYL 209 (a) Geodetic Lines.-Given a point P and at that point a vector, the geodetic line from Pin the direction of this vector is given by continuously moving the vector parallel to itself in its own direction. Employing a suitable parameter T the differential equation of the geodetic line is d 2Xµ. + r\"' dxv ij,!j = 0 dT2 vp dT dT • (Of course it cannot be characterized as the line of smallest length, because the notion of curve-length has no meaning.) (b) Tensor Oalculus.-To deduce, for example, a tensor field of rank 2 by differentiation from a covariant tensor field of rank 1 and weight O with components/µ., we call in the help of an arbitrary vector ~ at the point P, form the invariant /\"'~ and its infinitely small alteration on transition from the point P with the co-ordinates Xi,. to the neighbouring point P' with the co-ordinates Xi,. + dx\"' by shifting the vector along a parallel to itself during this transition. For this alteration we have 'c!f\"' r:\"'d ., df:p (~f\"' rp !, ) r:\"'a 'cJxv5 Xv + J p 5 = 'c!Xv - µ.v p 5 Xv. The quantities in brackets on the right are therefore the com- ponents of a tensor field of rank 2 and weight 0, which is formed from the field fin a perfectly invariant manner. ( c) Curvature.-To construct the analogue to Riemann's tensor of curvature, let us begin with the figure employed above, of an infinitely small parallelogram, consisting of the points P, P 1, P 2, and P 12 = P 21.* If we displace a vector x = ~ at P parallel to itself, to P 1 and from there to P 12, and a second time first to P 2 and thence to P 2i, then, since P 12 and P 21 coincide, there is a meaning in forming the difference Ax of the two vectors obtained a.t this point. For their com- ponents we have . (12) where the AR: a.re independent of the displaced vector x, but * [Here it is not essential that opposite sides of the infinitely small \" paral- lelogram\" a.re produced by parallel displa.cement one from the other; we a.re conoemed only with the coincidence of the points P11 and P 11.] 210 GRAVITATION AND ELECTRICITY on the other hand depend linearly on the surface-element defined by the two displacements PP1 = dx,,., PP 2 = ox,,.. Thus .:iR: = R:pa-dXpOXu = ! R:pa-AXpo-• The components of curvature R~pa-, depending solely on the place P, possess the two properties of symmetry that (1) they change sign on the interchange of the last two indices p and u, and (2), if we perform the three cylic interchanges vpu, and add up the appropriate components, the result is 0. Reducing the index µ,, we obtain at R,,..pa- the components of a covariant tensor of rank 4 and weight 1. Even without calculation we see that R divides in a natural, invariant manner into two parts, R:pu = P:pu - to:Fpa- (o: = 1 ifµ,= v; = O ifµ, =I· v), (13) of which the first, P:pa-• is anti-symmetrical, not only in the in- dices pu, but also in µ, and v. Whereas the equations F ,,.. = 0 characterize our space as one without an electromagnetic field, i.e. as one in which the problem of the conveyance of length is integrable, the equations P:pa- = 0 are, as (13) shows, the invariant conditions for the absence of a gravitational field, i.e. for the problem of the conveyance of direction to be integrable. The Euclidean space alone is one which at the same time is free of electricity and of gravitation. The simplest invariant of a, linear copy like (12), which to each vector x assigns a vector .:ix, is its \" spur \" _!.:iR:. n For this, by (13), we obtain in the present case the form - !Fpa-dXpOXu which we have already encountered above. The simplest in- variant of a tensor like - tFpa- is the \"square of its magni- tude\" . (14) L is evidently an invariant of weight - 2, because the tensor F has weight 0. If g is the negative determinant of the g,,.., and H. WEYL 211 the volume of an infinitely small element of volume, it is known that the Maxwell theory is governed by the quantity of electrical action, which is equal to the integral ~Ldc., of this simplest invariant, extended over any chosen territory, and indeed is governed in the sense that, with any variations of the g,,.v and cf,,,., which vanish at the limits of world-territory, we have where sJ Ldc., = J (S\"'dcf,,,. + T\"'VSg,,.v)dCIJ, S,,. = ~ 'iJ(,_/ jjF,.v) Jg 'iJxv are the left-hand sides of the generalized Maxwellian equations (the right-hand sides of which are the components of the four-current), and the T\"'v form the energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field. As L is an invariant of weight - 2, whereas the volume-element in n-dimensional geometry is an invariant of weight in, the integral has significance only when the number of dimensions n = 4. Thus on our interpretation the possibility of the Maxwell theory is restricted to the case of four dimensions. In the four-dimensional world, however, the quantity of electro- magnetic action becomes a pure number. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the quantity 1 cannot be ascertained in the traditional units of the (l,g.s. system until a physical problem, to be tested by observation (as for example the electron), has been calculated on the ha.sis of our theory. Passing now from geometry to physics, we have to assume, following the precedent of Mie's theory,* that all the laws of nature rest upon a definite integral invariant, the action- quantity Jwdw = J~dx, ~ = W,_/g, in such a way that the real world is distinguished from all other possible four-dimensional metrical spaces by the char- acteristic that for it the action-quantity contained in any part of its domain assumes a stationary value in relation to such variations of the potentials g,,.v, cf,,,. as vanish at the limits of * Ann, d, Physik, 37, 39, 40, 1912-13. 212 GRAVITATION AND ELECTRICITY the territory in question. W, the world-density of the action, must be an invariant of weight - 2. The action-quantity is in any case a pure number ; thus our theory at once accounts for that atomistic structure of the world to which current views attach the most fundamental importance-the action- qua.ntum. The simplest and most natural conjecture which we can make for W, is w = R\" RVpO\" = I R I 2• 11prr µ. For this we also have, by (13), w = Ip 12 + 4L. (There could be no doubt about anything here except perhaps the factor 4, with which the electric term L is added to the first.) But even without particularizing the action-quantity we can draw some general conclusions from the principle of action. For we shall show that as, ~cording to investiga- tions by Hilbert, Lorentz, Einstein, Klein, and the author,• the four laws of the conservation of matter (the energy- momentum tensor) are connected with the invariance of the action quantity (containing four arbitrary functions) with re- spect to transformations of co-ordinates, so in the same way the law of the conservation of electricity is connected with the \"measure-invariance\" [transition from (8) to (9)] which here makes its appearance for the first time, introducing a fifth arbitrary function. The manner in which the latter as- sociates itself with the principles of energy and momentum seems to me one of the strongest general arguments in favour of the theory here set out-so far as there can be any ques- tion at all of confirmation in purely speculative matters. For any variation which vanishes at the limits of the world-territory under consideration we have oJ ~dx = J (~\"vog,.v + \"'\"oq,,.)dx (~\"v = ~\"v) (15) * Hilbert, \"Die Grundlagen der Physik,\" Gottinger Na.chrichten, 20 Nov., 1915; H.
