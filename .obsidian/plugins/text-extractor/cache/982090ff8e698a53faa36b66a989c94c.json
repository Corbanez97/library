Consequently, the conventional ﬁeld theory courses are taught with a heavy emphasis on high energy physics. Over the years, however, it has become quite clear that the methods and tech- niques of ﬁeld theory are widely applicable in many areas of physics. The canonical quantization methods, which is how conventional ﬁeld theory courses are taught, do not bring out this feature of ﬁeld the- ory. A path integral description of ﬁeld theory is the appropriate setting for this. It is with this goal in mind, namely, to make gradu- ate students aware of the applicability of the ﬁeld theoretic methods to various areas, that the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Rochester introduced a new one semester course on ﬁeld theory in Fall 1991. This course was aimed at second year graduate students who had already taken a one year course on nonrelativistic quantum me- chanics but had not necessarily specialized into any area of physics and these lecture notes grew out of this course which I taught. In fact, the lecture notes are identical to what was covered in the class. Even in the published form, I have endeavored to keep as much of the detailed derivations of various results as I could — the idea being that a reader can then concentrate on the logical development of concepts without worrying about the technical details. Most of the concepts were developed within the context of quantum mechanics — which the students were expected to be familiar with — and subsequently these concepts were applied to various branches of physics. In writ- ing these lecture notes, I have added some references at the end of every chapter. They are only intended to be suggestive. There is so much literature that is available in this subject that it would have been impossible to include all of them. The references are not meant to be complete and I apologize to many whose works I have not cited in the references. Since this was developed as a course for general vii January 29, 2019 9:15 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 4 viii Preface students, the many interesting topics of gauge theories are also not covered in these lectures. It simply would have been impossible to do justice to these topics within a one-semester course. There are many who were responsible for these lecture notes. I would like to thank our chairman, Paul Slattery, for asking me to teach and design a syllabus for this course. The students deserve the most credit for keeping all the derivations complete and raising many issues which I, otherwise, would have taken for granted. I am grateful to my students Paulo Bedaque and Wen-Jui Huang as well as to Dr. Zhu Yang for straightening out many little details which were essential in presenting the material in a coherent and consistent way. I would also like to thank Michael Begel for helping out in numerous ways, in particular, in computer-generating all the ﬁgures in the book. The support of many colleagues was also vital for the completion of these lecture notes. Judy Mack, as always, has done a superb job as far as the appearance of the book is concerned and I sincerely thank her. Finally, I am grateful to Ammani for being there. Ashok Das Rochester. January 29, 2019 9:15 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 5 Preface to the Second Edition This second edition of the book is an expanded version which con- tains a chapter on path integral quantization of gauge theories as well as a chapter on anomalies. In addition, Chapter 6 (Supersymmetry) has been expanded to include a section on supersymmetric singular potentials. While these topics were not covered in the original course on path integrals, they are part of my lectures in other courses that I have taught at the University of Rochester and have been incorpo- rated into this new edition at the request of colleagues from all over the world. There are many people who have helped me to complete this edition of the book and I would like to thank, in particular, Judy Mack, Arsen Melikyan, Dave Munson and J. Boersma for all their assistance. Ashok Das Rochester. ix January 29, 2019 9:15 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 6 Preface to the Third Edition This third edition grew out of lectures I gave when I taught the course last Fall in 2017. As a result of these lectures, almost all chapters have been expanded for more clarity. The chapter on Anomalies and the Schwinger model (Chapter 13) has been completely rewritten for logical clarity. Two new chapters have been added in the new edi- tion which were primarily requested by students and colleagues all over the world. The proper time formalism of Schwinger has been discussed with simple examples at zero as well as at ﬁnite temper- ature. This is followed by the zeta function regularization where, again, simple examples are used to describe the essential features of the method. I would like to thank Sarah Henry and Pushpa Kalauni for going through parts of the book carefully and Dave Munson for sorting out all the computer related glitches.

17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 11 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Particles and ﬁelds Classically, there are two kinds of dynamical systems that we en- counter. First, there is the motion of a point particle or of ﬁnitely many particles (with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom) which can be described by a ﬁnite number of coordinates. And then, there are physical systems where the number of degrees of freedom is non- denumerably (noncountably) inﬁnite. Such systems are described by ﬁelds. Familiar examples of classical ﬁelds are the electromagnetic ﬁelds described by E(x,t)and B(x,t) or equivalently by the poten- tials (φ(x,t), A(x,t)). Similarly, the motion of a one-dimensional string is also described by a ﬁeld φ(x,t), namely, the displacement ﬁeld. Thus, while the coordinates of a particle depend only on time, ﬁelds depend continuously on some space variables as well. Correspondingly, a theory describing the dynamics of ﬁelds is usu- ally known as a D + 1 dimensional ﬁeld theory where D represents the number of spatial coordinates on which the ﬁeld variables de- pend. For example, a theory describing the displacements of the one- dimensional string would constitute a 1+1 dimensional ﬁeld theory whereas the more familiar Maxwell’s equations (in four dimensions) can be regarded as described by a 3+1 dimensional ﬁeld theory. In this language, then, it is clear that a theory describing the motion of a point particle can be regarded as a special case, namely, we can think of such a theory as a 0+1 dimensional ﬁeld theory. 1.2 Metric and other notations In these lectures, we will discuss both non-relativistic as well as rel- ativistic theories. For the relativistic case, we will use the Bjorken- Drell convention. Namely, the contravariant coordinates are assumed 1 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 12 2 1 Introduction to be given by xμ =(t, x),μ =0, 1, 2, 3 , (1.1) while thecovariant coordinateshavethe form xμ = ημνxν =(t, −x) . (1.2) Here we have assumed the speed of light to be unity (c =1). The covariant metric, therefore, follows to have a diagonal form with unit elements and signatures ημν =(+, −, −, −)= ηνμ . (1.3) The inverse or the contravariant metric clearly also has the same form, namely, ημν =(+, −, −, −)= ηνμ . (1.4) The invariant length is given by x2 = xμxμ = ημνxμxν = ημνxμxν = t2 − x2 . (1.5) The gradients are similarly obtained from Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) to be ∂μ = ∂ ∂xμ = ( ∂ ∂t , ∇) , (1.6) ∂μ = ∂ ∂xμ = ( ∂ ∂t , −∇) , (1.7) so that the D’Alembertian takes the form □ = ∂μ∂μ = ημν∂μ∂ν = ∂2 ∂t2 − ∇2 . (1.8) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 13 1.3 Functionals 3 1.3 Functionals It is evident that in dealing with dynamical systems we are dealing with functions of continuous variables. In fact, most of the time, we are really dealing with functions of functions which are otherwise known as functionals. For example, if we are considering the motion of a particle in a potential in one dimension with potential energy V (x), then the Lagrangian describing the system is given by L(x, ˙x)= 1 2 m ˙x2 − V (x)= T (˙x) − V (x), (1.9) where x(t)and ˙x(t) denote the coordinate and the velocity of the particle and the simplest functional we can think of is the action functional deﬁned as S[x]= tf∫ ti dtL(x, ˙x) . (1.10) Note that unlike a function whose value depends on a particular point in the coordinate space, the value of the action depends on the entire trajectory along which the integration is carried out. For diﬀerent paths connecting the initial and the ﬁnal points, the value of the action functional will be diﬀerent. A simple functional has the form F [f ]= ∫ dxF (f (x)), (1.11) where, for example, we may have F (f (x)) = (f (x))n . (1.12) Sometimes, one also says, loosely, that F (f (x)) is a functional. The notion of a derivative can be extended to the case of func- tionals in a natural way through the notion of generalized functions. Thus, one deﬁnes the functional derivative or the Gateaux derivative from the linear functional January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 14 4 1 Introduction d dϵ F [f + ϵv]∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 = ∫ dx δF [f ] δf (x) v(x) . (1.13) Equivalently, from the working point of view, this simply corresponds to deﬁning (namely, one changes the value of the function inﬁnitesi- mally only at x = y) δF (f (x)) δf (y) = lim ϵ→0 F (f (x)+ ϵδ(x − y)) − F (f (x)) ϵ , (1.14) and identifying δF [f ] δf (y) = ∫ dx δF (f (x)) δf (y) . (1.15) It now follows from Eq. (1.14) that δf (x) δf (y) = δ(x − y) . (1.16) The functional derivative satisﬁes all the properties of a deriva- tive, namely, it is linear and is associative, δ δf (x) (F1[f ]+ F2[f ]) = δF1[f ] δf (x) + δF2[f ] δf (x) , δ δf (x) (F1[f ]F2[f ]) = δF1[f ] δf (x) F2[f ]+ F1[f ] δF2[f ] δf (x) . (1.17) It obeys the chain rule of diﬀerentiation. Furthermore, we now see that given a functional F [f ], we can Taylor expand it in the form F [f ]= ∫ dxF (f (x)) = ∫ dxP0(x)+ ∫ dxdx1 P1(x, x1)(f (x1) − ¯f (x1)) + ∫ dxdx1dx2 P2(x, x1,x2)(f (x1) − ¯f (x1))(f (x2) − ¯f (x2)) + ··· , (1.18) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 15 1.3 Functionals 5 where P0(x)= F (f (x))|f (x)= ¯f (x) , P1(x, x1)= δF (f (x)) δf (x1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣f (x)= ¯f (x) , (1.19) P2(x, x1,x2)= 1 2! δ2F (f (x)) δf (x1)δf (x2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣f (x)= ¯f (x) , and so on. As simple examples, let us calculate a few functional derivatives. (i) Let F [f ]= ∫ dyF (f (y)) = ∫ dy (f (y))n, (1.20) where n denotes a positive integer. Then, from (1.14) we obtain δF (f (y)) δf (x) = lim ϵ→0 F (f (y)+ ϵδ(y − x)) − F (f (y)) ϵ = lim ϵ→0 (f (y)+ ϵδ(y − x))n − (f (y))n ϵ = lim ϵ→0 (f (y))n + nϵ(f (y))n−1δ(y − x)+ O(ϵ2) − (f (y))n ϵ = n(f (y))n−1δ(y − x)= F ′(f (y)) δ(y − x) , (1.21) wherewehaveidentiﬁed F ′(f (y)) = ∂F (f (y)) ∂f (y) . (1.22) Therefore, we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 16 6 1 Introduction δF [f ] δf (x) = ∫ dy δF (f (y)) δf (x) = ∫ dyn(f (y))n−1δ(y − x) = n(f (x))n−1 . (1.23) (ii) Let us next consider the one-dimensional action in Eq. (1.10) S[x]= tf∫ ti dt′ L(x(t′), ˙x(t′)), (1.24) with L(x(t), ˙x(t)) = 1 2 m(˙x(t))2 − V (x(t)) = T (˙x(t)) − V (x(t)) . (1.25) In a straightforward manner (see (1.21)), we obtain δV (x(t′)) δx(t) = lim ϵ→0 V (x(t′)+ ϵδ(t′ − t)) − V (x(t′)) ϵ = V ′(x(t′))δ(t′ − t) , (1.26) wherewehavedeﬁned V ′(x(t′)) = ∂V (x(t′)) ∂x(t′) . (1.27) Similarly, we have δT (˙x(t′)) δx(t) = lim ϵ→0 T (˙x(t′)+ ϵ d dt′ δ(t′ − t)) − T (˙x(t′)) ϵ = lim ϵ→0 m 2 (˙x(t′)+ ϵ d dt′ δ(t′ − t))2 − m 2 (˙x(t′))2 ϵ = m ˙x(t′) d dt′ δ(t′ − t) . (1.28) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 17 1.4 Review of quantum mechanics 7 It is clear now that δL(x(t′), ˙x(t′)) δx(t) = δ(T (˙x(t′)) − V (x(t′))) δx(t) = m ˙x(t′) d dt′ δ(t′ − t) − V ′(x(t′))δ(t′ − t) . (1.29) Consequently, in this case, we obtain for ti ≤ t ≤ tf δS[x] δx(t) = tf∫ ti dt′ δL(x(t′), ˙x(t′)) δx(t) = tf∫ ti dt′ (m ˙x(t′) d dt′ δ(t′ − t) − V ′(x(t′))δ(t′ − t)) = −m¨x(t) − V ′(x(t)) = − d dt ∂L(x(t), ˙x(t)) ∂ ˙x(t) + ∂L(x(t), ˙x(t)) ∂x(t) . (1.30) The right hand side is, of course, reminiscent of the Euler- Lagrange equation. In fact, we note that δS[x] δx(t) = − d dt ∂L ∂ ˙x(t) + ∂L ∂x(t) =0 , (1.31) gives the Euler-Lagrange equation as a functional extremum of the action. This is nothing other than the principle of least action ex- pressed in a compact notation in the language of functionals. 1.4 Review of quantum mechanics In this section, we will describe very brieﬂy the essential features of quantum mechanics assuming that the readers are familiar with the subject. The conventional approach to quantum mechanics starts with the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics and pro- motes observables to non-commuting operators. The dynamics of January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 18 8 1 Introduction the system, in this case, is given by the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation iℏ ∂|ψ(t)⟩ ∂t = H|ψ(t)⟩ , (1.32) where H denotes the Hamiltonian operator of the system. Equiva- lently, in the one dimensional case, the wave function of a particle satisﬁes iℏ ∂ψ(x, t) ∂t = H(x)ψ(x, t) = (− ℏ2 2m ∂2 ∂x2 + V (x)) ψ(x, t) , (1.33) wherewehaveidentiﬁed thewavefunction as ψ(x, t)= ⟨x|ψ(t)⟩ ,X|x⟩ = x|x⟩ , (1.34) with |x⟩ denoting the coordinate basis states. This, then, deﬁnes the time evolutionofthe system. The main purpose behind solving the Schr¨odinger equation lies in determining the time evolution operator which generates time translation of the system. Namely, the time evolution operator trans- forms the quantum mechanical state at an earlier time t2 toalater time t1 as |ψ(t1)⟩ = U (t1,t2)|ψ(t2)⟩ , (1.35) where U (t1,t2) denotes the time evolution operator. Clearly, for a time independent Hamiltonian, we see from (the Schr¨odinger equa- tion) Eq. (1.32) that for t1 >t2, U (t1,t2)= e− i ℏ (t1−t2)H , |ψ(t1)⟩ = e− i ℏ (t1−t2)H |ψ(t2)⟩ . (1.36) More explicitly, we can write U (t1,t2)= θ(t1 − t2)e− i ℏ (t1−t2)H , (1.37) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 19 1.4 Review of quantum mechanics 9 and it is now obvious that the time evolution operator is nothing other than the Green’s function for the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation and satisﬁes (iℏ ∂ ∂t1 − H) U (t1,t2)= iℏδ(t1 − t2) . (1.38) Determining this operator is equivalent to ﬁnding its matrix elements in a given basis. Thus, for example, in the coordinate basis deﬁned by X|x⟩ = x|x⟩ , (1.39) we can write ⟨x1|U (t1,t2)|x2⟩ = U (x1,t1; x2,t2) . (1.40) If we know the function U (x1,t1; x2,t2) completely, then we know the time evolution operator and the time evolution of the wave function can be written as (see (1.35)) ψ(x1,t1)= ∫ dx2 U (x1,t1; x2,t2)ψ(x2,t2) . (1.41) It is interesting to note that the dependence on the intermediate times drops out in the above equation as can be easily checked. Our discussion has been within the framework of the Schr¨odinger picture so far where the quantum states |ψ(t)⟩ carry time dependence while the operators are time independent. On the other hand, in the Heisenberg picture, where the quantum states are time independent, using Eq. (1.36) we can identify |ψ⟩H = |ψ(t =0)⟩S = |ψ(t =0)⟩ = e i ℏ tH |ψ(t)⟩ = e i ℏ tH |ψ(t)⟩S . (1.42) In this picture, the operators carry all the time dependence. For example, the coordinate operator in the Heisenberg picture is related January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 20 10 1 Introduction to the coordinate operator in the Schr¨odinger picture through the relation XH(t)= e i ℏ tH Xe− i ℏ tH . (1.43) The eigenstates of this operator satisfying XH(t)|x, t⟩H = x|x, t⟩H , (1.44) are then easily seen to be related to the coordinate basis in the Schr¨odinger picture through |x, t⟩H = e i ℏ tH |x⟩ . (1.45) We comment here parenthetically that the eigenvalues of any Heisenberg operator ΩH, not depending on time explicitly, is time independent. This follows from the fact that the expectation value of the operator, in its eigenstate, is time independent S⟨ω|ΩS|ω⟩S = ω = H⟨ω, t|ΩH|ω, t⟩H. (1.46) This holds true even for the interaction picture which we will com- ment on shortly (this is how diﬀerent pictures are deﬁned). It is clear now that for t1 >t2 we can write H⟨x1,t1|x2,t2⟩H = ⟨x1|e− i ℏ t1H e i ℏ t2H |x2⟩ = ⟨x1|e− i ℏ (t1−t2)H |x2⟩ = ⟨x1|U (t1,t2)|x2⟩ = U (x1,t1; x2,t2) . (1.47) This shows that the matrix elements of the time evolution operator in the coordinate basis (see (1.40)) are nothing other than the time ordered transition amplitudes between the coordinate basis states in the Heisenberg picture. Therefore, if we know the transition ampli- tudes of the coordinate basis in the Heisenberg picture completely, we know the time evolution operator. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 21 1.5 References 11 Finally, there is the interaction picture where both the quantum states as well as the operators carry partial time dependence. With- out going into any technical detail, let us simply note here that the interaction picture is quite useful in the study of nontrivially interact- ing theories. In any case, the goal of the study of quantum mechanics in any of these pictures is to construct the matrix elements of the time evolution operator which (in the coordinate basis) as we have seen can be identiﬁed with the time ordered transition amplitudes between the coordinate basis states in the Heisenberg picture. 1.5 References A.

Consider, for simplic- ity, a one dimensional quantum mechanical system. The eigenstates of the coordinate operator, as we have seen in Eq. (1.39), satisfy X|x⟩ = x|x⟩ . (2.1) These eigenstates deﬁne an orthonormal basis. Namely, they satisfy ⟨x|x′⟩ = δ(x − x′) , ∫ dx |x⟩⟨x| = \u0000 . (2.2) Similarly, the eigenstates of the momentum operator satisfying P |p⟩ = p|p⟩ , (2.3) also deﬁne an orthonormal basis. (In general, the eigenstates of any Hermitian operator deﬁne a complete basis.) Namely, the momentum eigenstates satisfy ⟨p|p ′⟩ = δ(p − p′) , ∫ dp |p⟩⟨p| = \u0000 . (2.4) 13 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 24 14 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics The inner product of the coordinate and the momentum basis states deﬁnes the transition amplitude between the two basis states. An- other way of saying this is to note that the inner product between the two basis states deﬁnes the coeﬃcients of expansion of one basis in terms of the other. One can readily determine that ⟨p|x⟩ = 1 √2πℏ e− i ℏ px = ⟨x|p⟩∗ . (2.5) In fact, these arise naturally in the deﬁning relations for the Fourier transform of a function. Namely, using the completeness relations of the basis states, the Fourier transform of a function can be deﬁned as f (x)= ⟨x|f ⟩ = ∫ dp ⟨x|p⟩⟨p|f ⟩ = 1 √2πℏ ∫ dpe i ℏ px f (p)= 1 √2π ∫ dp ℏ e i ℏ px √ℏf (p) = 1 √2π ∫ dkeikx ˜f (k) , ˜f (k)= ℏf (p), (2.6) ˜f (k)= √ℏ f (p)= √ℏ⟨p|f ⟩ = √ℏ ∫ dx ⟨p|x⟩⟨x|f ⟩ = √ℏ √2πℏ ∫ dxe− i ℏ pxf (x) = 1 √2π ∫ dxe−ikxf (x) . (2.7) The Fourier transforms simply take a function from a given space to its conjugate space or the dual space. Here k = p ℏ can be thought of as the wave number in the case of a quantum mechanical particle. (Some other authors may deﬁne Fourier transform with alternate normalizations. Here, the deﬁnition is symmetrical.) As we have seen in Eq. (1.45), the Heisenberg states are related to the Schr¨odinger states in a simple way. For the coordinate basis states, for example, we have January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 25 2.2 Operator ordering 15 |x, t⟩H = e i ℏ tH |x⟩ . (2.8) It follows now that the coordinate basis states in the Heisenberg picture satisfy H⟨x, t|x′,t⟩H = ⟨x|e− i ℏ tH e i ℏ tH |x′⟩ = ⟨x|x′⟩ = δ(x − x′) , (2.9) and∫ dx |x, t⟩HH⟨x, t| = ∫ dxe i ℏ tH |x⟩⟨x|e− i ℏ tH = e i ℏ tH ∫ dx |x⟩⟨x| e− i ℏ tH = e i ℏ tH \u0000 e− i ℏ tH = \u0000 . (2.10) It is worth noting here that the orthonormality as well as the com- pleteness relations hold for the Heisenberg states only at equal times. 2.2 Operator ordering In the Hamiltonian formalism, the transition from classical mechan- ics to quantum mechanics is achieved by promoting observables to Hermitian operators (which do not necessarily commute). Conse- quently, the Hamiltonian of the classical system is supposed to go over to the quantum operator H(x, p) → H(xop,pop) . (2.11) This, however, does not specify what should be done when products of x and p (which are non-commuting as operators) are involved. For example, classically we know that xp = px . January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 26 16 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics Therefore, the order of these terms does not matter in the classical Hamiltonian. Quantum mechanically, however, the order of the op- erators is quite crucial and a priori it is not clear what such a term ought to correspond to in the quantum theory. This is the operator ordering problem in quantum mechanics and, unfortunately, there is no well deﬁned principle which speciﬁes the order of operators in the passage from classical to quantum mechanics. There are, however, two prescriptions which one uses conventionally. In normal ordering, one orders the products of x’s and p’s such that the momenta stand to the left of the coordinates. Thus, xp N.O. −−−→ px , px N.O. −−−→ px , x2p N.O. −−−→ px2 , xpx N.O. −−−→ px2 , (2.12) and so on. (This is commonly used in the operator description of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories.) However, the prescription that is much more widely used in quantum mechanics and which is much more satisfactory from various other points of view is the Weyl or- dering. Here one symmetrizes the product of operators in all possible combinations with equal weight. Thus, xp W.O. −−−−→ 1 2 (xp + px) , px W.O. −−−−→ 1 2 (xp + px) , x2p W.O. −−−−→ 1 3 (x2p + xpx + px2) , xpx W.O. −−−−→ 1 3 (x2p + xpx + px2) , (2.13) and so on. For normal ordering, it is easy to see that for any quantum Hamiltonian obtained from the classical Hamiltonian H(x, p) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 27 2.2 Operator ordering 17 ⟨x′|H N.O.|x⟩ = ∫ dp ⟨x′|p⟩⟨p|H N.O.|x⟩ = ∫ dp ⟨x′|p⟩⟨p|x⟩ H(x, p) = ∫ dp 2πℏ e i ℏ p(x′−x)H(x, p) . (2.14) Here we have used the completeness relations of the momentum basis states given in Eq. (2.4) as well as the deﬁning relations in Eqs. (2.1), (2.3) and (2.5). (The matrix element of the quantum Hamiltonian is a classical function for which the ordering is irrelevant.) To understand Weyl ordering, on the other hand, let us note that the expansion of (αxop + βpop)N , generates the Weyl ordering of products of the form xn oppm op naturally if we treat xop and pop as non-commuting operators. In fact, we can easily show that (αxop + βpop)N = ∑ n+m=N N ! n!m! αnβm(xn oppm op)W.O. (2.15) The expansion of the exponential operator e(αxop+βpop) , would, of course, generate all such powers and by analyzing the ma- trix elements of this exponential operator, we can learn about the matrix elements of Weyl ordered Hamiltonians. From the fact that the commutator of xop and pop is a constant, using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula, we obtain e( αxop 2 )eβpope( αxop 2 ) = e( αxop 2 )e(βpop+ αxop 2 − iℏαβ 4 ) = e(αxop+βpop+ iℏαβ 4 − iℏαβ 4 ) = e(αxop+βpop) . (2.16) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 28 18 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics Using this relation, it can now be easily shown that ⟨x′|e(αxop+βpop)|x⟩ = ⟨x′|e( αxop 2 )eβpope( αxop 2 )|x⟩ = e αx′ 2 ⟨x′|eβpop|x⟩ e αx 2 = ∫ dp ⟨x′|eβpop|p⟩⟨p|x⟩ e α(x+x′) 2 = ∫ dp 2πℏ e i ℏ p(x′−x)e( α(x+x′) 2 +βp) . (2.17) Once again, we have used here the completeness properties given in Eq. (2.4) as well as the deﬁning relations in Eqs. (2.1), (2.3) and (2.5). It follows from this that for a Weyl ordered quantum Hamiltonian, we have ⟨x′|H W.O.(xop,pop)|x⟩ = ∫ dp 2πℏ e i ℏ p(x′−x)H ( x + x′ 2 ,p ) . (2.18) As we see, the matrix elements of any Weyl ordered Hamiltonian simply lead to what is known as the mid-point prescription and this is what we will use in all of our discussions. 2.3 Feynman path integral We are now ready to calculate the transition amplitude between two coordinate basis states in the Heisenberg picture. Let us recall that in the Heisenberg picture, for tf >ti,wehave U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= H⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩H . Let us divide the time interval between the initial and the ﬁnal time into N equal segments of inﬁnitesimal length ϵ. Namely, let ϵ = tf − ti N . (2.19) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 29 2.3 Feynman path integral 19 In other words, for simplicity, we discretize the time interval and in the end, we will take the continuum limit ϵ → 0and N →∞ such that Eq. (2.19) holds true. We can now label the intermediate times as, say, tn = ti + nϵ, n =1, 2, ··· , (N − 1) . (2.20) Introducing complete sets of coordinate basis states for every intermediate time point (see Eq. (2.10)), we obtain U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= H⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩H = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1 H⟨xf ,tf |xN −1,tN −1⟩H × H⟨xN −1,tN −1|xN −2,tN −2⟩H ···H ⟨x1,t1|xi,ti⟩H . (2.21) In writing this, we have clearly assumed an inherent time ordering from left to right. Let us also note here that while there are N inner products in the above expression, there are only (N −1) intermediate points of integration. Furthermore, we note that any intermediate inner product in Eq. (2.21) has the form H⟨xn,tn|xn−1,tn−1⟩H = ⟨xn|e− i ℏ tnH e i ℏ tn−1H |xn−1⟩ = ⟨xn|e− i ℏ (tn−tn−1)H |xn−1⟩ = ⟨xn|e− i ℏ ϵH |xn−1⟩ = ∫ dpn 2πℏ e i ℏ pn(xn−xn−1)− i ℏ ϵH( xn+xn−1 2 ,pn) . (2.22) Here we have used the mid-point prescription of Eq. (2.18) corre- sponding to Weyl ordering. Substituting this form of the inner product into the transition amplitude, we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 30 20 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1 dp1 2πℏ ··· dpN 2πℏ × e i ℏ N∑ n=1 (pn(xn−xn−1)−ϵH( xn+xn−1 2 ,pn)) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1 dp1 2πℏ ··· dpN 2πℏ × e iϵ ℏ N∑ n=1 ( (pn(xn−xn−1) ϵ −H( xn+xn−1 2 ,pn)) . (2.23) In writing this, we have identiﬁed x0 = xi,xN = xf . (2.24) This is the crudest form of Feynman’s path integral and is deﬁned in the phase space of the system. It is worth emphasizing here that thenumberofintermediatecoordinateintegrationsdiﬀersfromthe number of momentum integrations and has profound consequences in the study of the symmetry properties of the transition amplitudes. Note that in the continuum limit, namely, for ϵ → 0, we can write the exponent in Eq. (2.23) as lim ϵ→0 N →∞ i ℏ ϵ N∑ n=1 (pn ( xn − xn−1 ϵ ) − H ( xn + xn−1 2 ,pn )) = i ℏ tf∫ ti dt (p ˙x − H(x, p)) = i ℏ tf∫ ti dtL . (2.25) Namely, it is proportional to the action in the mixed variables (x, ˙x, p). (It is worth commenting here that if we take the continuum limit in January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 31 2.3 Feynman path integral 21 the exponent itself, the action would appear to be the same, both for the normal ordering and the Weyl ordering since we have ne- glected order O(ϵ) terms. However, we should remember that in the calculation of the transition amplitude, the continuum limit is to be taken only at the end. This may lead to diﬀerent contributions from the two orderings of the Hamiltonian. For example, the integrations may give rise to divergences which may combine with O(ϵ)orhigher terms to give ﬁnite contributions.) To obtain the more familiar form of the path integral involving the Lagrangian in the conﬁguration space, let us specialize to the class of Hamiltonians which are quadratic in the momentum vari- ables. Namely, let us choose H(x, p)= p2 2m + V (x) . (2.26) In such a case, we have from Eq. (2.23) U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1 dp1 2πℏ ··· dpN 2πℏ × e iϵ ℏ N∑ n=1 (pn( xn−xn−1 ϵ )− p2 n 2m −V ( xn+xn−1 2 )) . (2.27) The momentum integrals are Gaussian and, therefore, can be done readily. We note that ∫ dpn 2πℏ e− iϵ ℏ ( p2 n 2m − pn(xn−xn−1) ϵ ) = ∫ dpn 2πℏ e− iϵ 2mℏ (p2 n− 2mpn(xn−xn−1) ϵ ) = ∫ dpn 2πℏ e− iϵ 2mℏ [(pn− m(xn−xn−1) ϵ )2−( m(xn−xn−1) ϵ )2] = 1 2πℏ ( 2πmℏ iϵ ) 1 2 e imϵ 2ℏ ( xn−xn−1 ϵ )2 = ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 e imϵ 2ℏ ( xn−xn−1 ϵ )2 . (2.28) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 32 22 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics Substituting this back into the transition amplitude in Eq. (2.27), we obtain U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 × ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1e iϵ ℏ N∑ n=1 ( m 2 ( xn−xn−1 ϵ )2−V ( xn+xn−1 2 )) = A ∫ Dxe i ℏ tf∫ ti dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2−V (x)) = A ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] , (2.29) where A is a constant independent of the dynamics of the system and S[x] is the action for the system given in Eq. (1.10). This is Feynman’s path integral for the transition amplitude in quantum mechanics. t x \u0000 ti \u0000 tf To understand the meaning of (2.29), let us try to understand the meaning of the path integral measure Dx. In this integration, the end points are held ﬁxed and only the intermediate coordinates are integrated over the entire space. Any given set of particular values for the intermediate points, of course, deﬁnes a trajectory between the initial and the ﬁnal points. Therefore, integrating over all such January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 33 2.4 The classical limit 23 values (that is precisely what the integrations over the intermedi- ate points are supposed to do) is equivalent to summing over all the paths connecting the initial and the ﬁnal points. In other words, Feynman’s path integral (2.29) simply says that the transition am- plitude between an initial and a ﬁnal (coordinate) state is the sum over all paths, connecting the two points, of the weight factor e i ℏ S[x]. We know from the study of quantum mechanics that if a process can take place in several distinct ways, then the transition (probability) amplitude is the sum of the individual amplitudes corresponding to every possible way the process can take place. The sum over the paths is, therefore, quite expected. However, it is the weight factor, e i ℏ S[x], that is quite crucial and unexpected. Classically, we know that it is the classical action (the action for the classical trajectory which satisﬁes the Euler-Lagrange equation) that determines the classical dynamics. Quantum mechanically, however, what we see is that the values of the action for all the paths contribute to the transition amplitude. It is also worth pointing out here that even though we have derived the path integral representation for the transition am- plitude for a special class of Hamiltonians, the expression holds in general. For Hamiltonians which are not quadratic in the momenta, one should simply be more careful in deﬁning the path integral mea- sure Dx. 2.4 The classical limit As we have seen in Eq. (2.29), the transition amplitude can be written as the sum over paths of a phase factor involving the action and in the case of a one dimensional Hamiltonian which is quadratic in the momentum, it has the form U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= A ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ AN ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1 × e iϵ ℏ N∑ n=1 ( m 2 ( xn−xn−1 ϵ )2−V ( xn+xn−1 2 )) , (2.30) where AN = ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 . (2.31) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 34 24 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics Even though one can be more quantitative in the discussion of the behavior of the transition amplitude, let us try to be qualitative in the following. We note that for paths where xn ≫ xn−1, the ﬁrst term in the exponential would be quite large, particularly since ϵ is inﬁnitesimally small. Therefore, such paths will lead to a very large phase and consequently, the weight factor can easily be positive or negative. In other words, for every such xn, there would be a nearby xn diﬀering only slightly with a phase which would have a cancelling eﬀect. Thus, in the path integral, all such contributions will average out to zero. \u0000 \u0000 ti tf xcl(t) 1 2 3 Let us, therefore, concentrate only on paths connecting the ini- tial and the ﬁnal points that diﬀer from one another only slightly. For simplicity, we only look at continuous paths which are diﬀerentiable. (A more careful analysis shows that the paths which contribute non- trivially are the continuous paths which are not necessarily diﬀeren- tiable. But for simplicity of argument, we will ignore this technical point.) The question that we would like to understand is how, from among all the paths which can contribute to the transition ampli- tude, it is only the classical path that is singled out in the classical limit, namely, when ℏ → 0. We note here that the weight factor in the path integral, namely, e i ℏ S[x], is a phase which involves the action multiplied by a large quantity when ℏ → 0. Mathematically, therefore, it is clear that the dominant contribution to the path inte- gral would arise from paths near the ones which extremize the phase factor. In other words, only trajectories close to the ones satisfying January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 35 2.5 Equivalence with the Schr¨odinger equation 25 δS[x] δx(t) =0, (2.32) would contribute signiﬁcantly to the transition amplitude in the clas- sical limit. But, from the principle of least action, we know that these are precisely the trajectories which a classical particle would follow, namely, the classical trajectories. We can see this more intuitively in the following way. Suppose, we are considering a path, say #3, which is quite far away from the classical trajectory and which contributes a weight factor e i ℏ S3. For every such path, there will be a nearby path, inﬁnitesimally close, say #2, where the action would diﬀer by a small amount so that it would contribute a weight factor e i ℏ (S3+δ). However, since the action is multiplied by a large constant (ℏ → 0), the phase diﬀerence between the two paths would be large and e i ℏ δ can have any sign. As a result, all such paths will average out to zero in the sum. Near the classical trajectory, however, the action is stationary. Consequently, if we choose a path inﬁnitesimally close to the classical path, the action will not change and the weight factor for any two such paths will be the same. Therefore, all such paths will add up coherently and give the dominant contribution as ℏ → 0. It is in this way that the classical trajectory is singled out in the clas- sical limit, not because it contributes the most, but rather because there are paths inﬁnitesimally close to it which add coherently. One can, of course, make various estimates as to how far away a path can be from the classical trajectory before its contribution becomes unimportant. But let us not go into these details here. 2.5 Equivalence with the Schr¨odinger equation At this point one may wonder about the Schr¨odinger equation in the path integral formalism. Namely, it is not clear how we can recover the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation (see Eq. (1.33)) from the path integral representation of the transition amplitude. Let us recall that the Schr¨odinger equation is a diﬀerential equation. Therefore, it determines changes in the wave function for inﬁnitesimal time in- tervals. Consequently, to derive the Schr¨odinger equation, we merely have to examine the inﬁnitesimal form of the transition amplitude or January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 36 26 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics the path integral. From the explicit form of the transition amplitude in Eq. (2.30), we obtain for inﬁnitesimal ϵ U (xf ,tf = ϵ; xi,ti =0) = ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 e iϵ ℏ ( m 2 ( xf −xi ϵ )2−V ( xf +xi 2 )) . (2.33) We also know from Eq. (1.41) that the transition amplitude is the propagator which gives the propagation (time evolution) of the wave function in the following way, ψ(x, ϵ)= ∞∫ −∞ dx′ U (x, ϵ; x′, 0)ψ(x′, 0) . (2.34) Therefore, substituting the form of the transition amplitude namely, Eq. (2.33) into Eq. (2.34), we obtain ψ(x, ϵ)= ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 ∞∫ −∞ dx′e im 2ℏϵ (x−x′)2− iϵ ℏ V ( x+x′ 2 )ψ(x′, 0) . (2.35) Let us next change variables to η = x′ − x, (2.36) so that we can write ψ(x, ϵ)= ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 ∞∫ −∞ dηe( im 2ℏϵ η2− iϵ ℏ V (x+ η 2 ))ψ(x + η, 0) . (2.37) It is obvious that because ϵ is inﬁnitesimal, if η is large, then the ﬁrst term in the exponent in (2.37) would lead to rapid oscillations and all such contributions will average out to zero. Therefore, the dominant contribution will come from the region of integration January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 37 2.5 Equivalence with the Schr¨odinger equation 27 0 ≤|η|≤ ( 2πℏϵ m ) 1 2 , (2.38) where the change in the ﬁrst exponent is of the order of unity. (In other words, |η|≃ ϵ1/2.) Keeping this in mind, we can Taylor ex- pand the integrand and since we are interested in the inﬁnitesimal behavior, we can keep terms consistently up to order ϵ.In this way, we obtain (remember ϵ ∼ η2) ψ(x, ϵ)= ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 ∞∫ −∞dηe im 2ℏϵ η2 (1 − iϵ ℏ V (x + η 2 ) )ψ(x + η, 0) = ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 ∞∫ −∞ dηe im 2ℏϵ η2 (1 − iϵ ℏ V (x)+ O(ϵη)) × (ψ(x, 0) + ηψ′(x, 0) + η2 2 ψ′′(x, 0) + O(η3)) = ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 ∞∫ −∞ dηe im 2ℏϵ η2[ψ(x, 0) − iϵ ℏ V (x)ψ(x, 0) + ηψ′(x, 0) + η2 2 ψ′′(x, 0) + O(η3,ϵ2)] . (2.39) The individual integrations can be easily done and the results are ∞∫ −∞ dηe im 2ℏϵ η2 = ( 2πiℏϵ m ) 1 2 , ∞∫ −∞ dηηe im 2ℏϵ η2 =0 , ∞∫ −∞ dηη2 e im 2ℏϵ η2 = iℏϵ m ( 2πiℏϵ m ) 1 2 . (2.40) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 38 28 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics Note that these integrals contain oscillatory integrands and the sim- plest way of evaluating them is through a regularization. For exam- ple, ∞∫ −∞ dηe im 2ℏϵ η2 = lim δ→0+ ∞∫ −∞ dηe( im 2ℏϵ −δ)η2 = lim δ→0+ ( π δ − im 2ℏϵ ) 1 2 = ( 2πiℏϵ m ) 1 2 , (2.41) and so on. Substituting these back into Eq. (2.39), we obtain ψ (x, ϵ)= ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 [( 2πiℏϵ m ) 1 2 (ψ (x, 0) − iϵ ℏ V (x) ψ (x, 0)) + iℏϵ 2m ( 2πiℏϵ m ) 1 2 ψ′′ (x, 0) + O (ϵ2)] = ψ (x, 0) + iℏϵ 2m ψ′′ (x, 0) − iϵ ℏ V (x) ψ (x, 0) + O (ϵ2) , or,ψ(x, ϵ) − ψ(x, 0) = − iϵ ℏ ( − ℏ2 2m ∂2 ∂x2 + V (x) )ψ(x, 0) + O(ϵ2), or,iℏ ( ψ(x, ϵ) − ψ(x, 0) ϵ ) = ( − ℏ2 2m ∂2 ∂x2 + V (x) ) ψ(x, 0) + O(ϵ2). (2.42) In the limit ϵ → 0, therefore, we obtain the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation (Eq. (1.33)) iℏ ∂ψ (x, t) ∂t = (− ℏ2 2m ∂2 ∂x2 + V (x)) ψ (x, t) . The path integral representation, therefore, contains the Schr¨odinger equation and is equivalent to it.

Namely, the integrand which is the phase factor is a functional of the trajec- tory between the initial and the ﬁnal points and we are integrating over all possible paths between these two points. Since we do not have a feeling for such quantities, let us evaluate some of these inte- grals associated with simple systems. The free particle is probably the simplest of quantum mechanical systems. For a free particle in one dimension, the Lagrangian has the form L = 1 2 m ˙x2 . (2.43) Therefore, from our deﬁnition of the transition amplitude in Eq. (2.29) or (2.30), we obtain U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1 e iϵ ℏ N∑ n=1 m 2 ( xn−xn−1 ϵ )2 = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ∫ dx1 ··· dxN −1 e im 2ℏϵ N∑ n=1(xn−xn−1)2 . (2.44) Scaling the variables of integration as yn = ( m 2ℏϵ ) 1 2 xn , (2.45) we have U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ( 2ℏϵ m ) N −1 2 × ∫ dy1 ··· dyN −1 ei N∑ n=1(yn−yn−1)2 . (2.46) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 40 30 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics This is a coupled set of Gaussian integrals which can be evalu- ated in many diﬀerent ways. However, the simplest method probably is to work out a few lower order terms and derive a pattern. For a single integration, we note that ∫ dy1 ei((y1−y0)2+(y2−y1)2) = ∫ dy1 ei(2(y1− y0+y2 2 )2+ 1 2 (y2−y0)2) = ( iπ 2 ) 1 2 e i 2 (y2−y0)2 . (2.47) If we had two intermediate integrations, then we will have ∫ dy1dy2 ei((y1−y0)2+(y2−y1)2+(y3−y2)2) = ( iπ 2 ) 1 2 ∫ dy2 ei( 1 2 (y2−y0)2+(y3−y2)2) = ( iπ 2 ) 1 2 ∫ dy2 e ( 3i 2 (y2− y0+2y3 3 )2+ i 3 (y3−y0)2) = ( iπ 2 ) 1 2 ( 2iπ 3 ) 1 2 e i 3 (y3−y0)2 = ( (iπ)2 3 ) 1 2 e i 3 (y3−y0)2 . (2.48) A pattern is now obvious and using this we can write U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ( 2ℏϵ m ) N −1 2 ( (iπ)N −1 N ) 1 2 e i N (yN −y0)2 = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ( 2πiℏϵ m ) N −1 2 1 √N e im 2ℏNϵ (xN −x0)2 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 41 2.6 Free particle 31 = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏNϵ ) 1 2 e im 2ℏNϵ (xf −xi)2 = ( m 2πiℏ (tf − ti) ) 1 2 e i ℏ m(xf −xi)2 2(tf −ti) . (2.49) Thus, we see that for a free particle, the transition amplitude can be explicitly evaluated. It has the right behavior in the sense that, as tf → ti, U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) → δ(xf − xi), (2.50) which is nothing other than the orthonormality relation for the states in the Heisenberg picture given in Eq. (2.9). Second, all the poten- tially dangerous singular terms involving ϵ have disappeared. Fur- thermore, this is exactly the result one would obtain by solving the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation. It expresses the well known fact that even a well localized wave packet spreads (disperses) with time. Namely, even the simplest of (linear) equations has only dis- persive solutions. Let us note here that since S[x]= tf∫ ti dt 1 2 m ˙x2, (2.51) the Euler-Lagrange equations for the system give (see Eq. (1.31)) δS[x] δx(t) = m¨x =0 . (2.52) This givesassolutions ˙xcl(t)= v = constant . (2.53) Thus, for the classical trajectory, we have January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 42 32 2 Path integrals and quantum mechanics S[xcl]= tf∫ ti dt 1 2 m ˙x2 cl = 1 2 mv2(tf − ti) . (2.54) On the other hand, since v is a constant, we can write xf − xi = v(tf − ti), or,v = xf − xi tf − ti . (2.55) Substituting this back into Eq. (2.54), we obtain S[xcl]= 1 2 m ( xf − xi tf − ti )2 (tf − ti)= m 2 (xf − xi)2 tf − ti . (2.56) We recognize, therefore, that we can also write the quantum transi- tion amplitude, in this case, simply as U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= ( m 2πiℏ (tf − ti) ) 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] . (2.57) This is a particular characteristic of some of the quantum systems which can be solved exactly. Namely, for these systems, the transi- tion amplitude can be written in the form U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= Ae i ℏ S[xcl] , (2.58) where A is a constant. Finally, let us note from the explicit form of the transition am- plitude in Eq. (2.49) that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 43 2.7 References 33 ∂U ∂tf = − U 2(tf − ti) − im 2ℏ ( xf − xi tf − ti )2 U, ∂U ∂xf = im ℏ ( xf − xi tf − ti ) U, ∂2U ∂x2 f = im ℏ U tf − ti + ( im ℏ )2 ( xf − xi tf − ti )2 U = − 2m ℏ2 ( −iℏ U 2(tf − ti) + m 2 ( xf − xi tf − ti )2 U ) = − 2m ℏ2 (iℏ ∂U ∂tf ) . (2.59) Therefore, it follows that iℏ ∂U ∂tf = − ℏ2 2m ∂2U ∂x2 f , (2.60) which is equivalent to saying that the transition amplitude obtained from Feynman’s path integral, indeed, solves the Schr¨odinger equa- tion for a free particle (compare with Eq. (1.38)). 2.7 References A. Das, Lectures on Quantum Mechanics, Hindustan Book Agency and World Scientiﬁc Publishing. R. P. Feynman and A. R.

In fact, let us consider the oscillator interacting with an external source described by the Lagrangian L = 1 2 m ˙x2 − 1 2 mω2x2 + Jx , (3.1) with the action given by S = ∫ dtL . (3.2) Here, for example, we can think of the time dependent external source J(t) as an electric ﬁeld if the oscillator carries an electric charge. The well known results for the free harmonic oscillator can be obtained from this system in the limit J(t) → 0. Furthermore, we know that if the external source were time independent, then the problem can be solved exactly simply because in this case we can write the Lagrangian of Eq. (3.1) as L = 1 2 m ˙x2 − 1 2 mω2x2 + Jx = 1 2 m ˙x2 − 1 2 mω2 (x − J mω2 )2 + J 2 2mω2 = 1 2 m ˙x2 − 1 2 mω2x2 + J 2 2mω2 , (3.3) 35 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 46 36 3 Harmonic oscillator wherewehavedeﬁned x = x − J mω2 . (3.4) In other words, in such a case, the classical equilibrium position of the oscillator is shifted by a constant amount, namely, the system behaves like a spring suspended freely under the eﬀect of gravity. The system described by Eq. (3.1) is, therefore, of considerable interest because we can obtain various known special cases in diﬀerent limits. Besides, as we will see later, a source is a great tool for generating correlation functions in the path integral formalism. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the action in Eq. (3.2) gives the classical trajectory and takes the form δS[x] δx(t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x=xcl =0, or,m¨xcl + mω2xcl − J =0 , (3.5) and the general form of the transition amplitude, as we have seen in Eq. (2.29), is given by U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= A ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] . (3.6) To evaluate this functional integral, let us deﬁne x(t)= xcl(t)+ η(t) , (3.7) where the variable η(t) represents the quantum ﬂuctuations around the classical path, namely, it measures the deviation of a trajectory from the classical trajectory. Since the end points of the trajectories are ﬁxed, the ﬂuctuations satisfy the boundary conditions η(ti)= η(tf )=0 . (3.8) We can Taylor expand the action about the classical path as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 47 3.1 Path integral for the harmonic oscillator 37 S[x]= S[xcl + η]= S[xcl]+ ∫ dtη(t) δS[x] δx(t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x=xcl + 1 2! ∫ dt1dt2 η(t1)η(t2) δ2S[x] δx(t1)δx(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x=xcl , (3.9) and the expansion terminates since the action is at most quadratic in the dynamical variables x(t). We note from Eq. (3.5) that the action is an extremum for the classical trajectory. Therefore, we have δS[x] δx(t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x=xcl =0 , (3.10) and consequently, we can also write Eq. (3.9) as S[x]= S[xcl]+ 1 2! ∫ dt1dt2 η(t1)η(t2) δ2S[x] δx(t1)δx(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x=xcl . (3.11) If we evaluate the functional derivative in Eq. (3.11) for the action in Eq. (3.2), we can also rewrite the action as (this can also be obtained by substituting (3.7) directly into the action and using the classical equation after integrating by parts the velocity dependent term linear in η) S[x]= S[xcl]+ 1 2 tf∫ ti dt (m ˙η2 − mω2η2) . (3.12) As a technical aside, let us note that given the action (3.2), we have dS[x + ϵv] dϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 = ∫ dt (m ˙x(t)˙v(t) − mω2x(t)v(t)+ Jv(t)) = ∫ dt (−m¨x(t) − mω2x(t)+ J(t)) v(t), (3.13) which determines (see (1.13) and compare with (3.5)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 48 38 3 Harmonic oscillator S′[x(t)] = δS[x] δx(t) = −m¨x(t) − mω2x(t)+ J(t). (3.14) Taking a second functional derivative, we obtain dS′[x(t1)+ ϵ v(t1)] dϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 = −m¨v(t1) − mω2v(t1) = ∫ dt2 (−m d2 dt2 2 − mω2) δ(t1 − t2) v(t2), (3.15) which determines the second functional derivative of the action to be δ2S[x] δx(t2)δx(t1) = −m ( d2 dt2 2 + ω2) δ(t1 − t2), (3.16) and, when substituted into (3.11), this leads to (3.12) after integra- tion by parts. It is clear that summing over all the paths is equivalent to sum- ming over all possible ﬂuctuations subject to the constraint in (3.8). Consequently, we can rewrite the transition amplitude in this case as U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= A ∫ Dηe ( i ℏ S[xcl]+ i 2ℏ tf∫ ti dt (m ˙η2−mω2η2) ) = Ae i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ Dηe im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dt ( ˙η2−ω2η2). (3.17) This is an integral where the exponent is quadratic in the integration variables (namely, it is a functional Gaussian integral) and such an integral can be done in several ways. Since the harmonic oscillator is a fundamental system in any branch of physics, we will evaluate this integral in three diﬀerent ways so as to develop a feeling for path integrals. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 49 3.2 Method of Fourier transform 39 3.2 Method of Fourier transform First of all, we note that the integrand in the exponent of the func- tional integral does not depend on time explicitly. Therefore, we can redeﬁne the variable of integration in the exponent as t → t − ti ,ti → 0,tf → tf − ti, (3.18) in which case, we can write the transition amplitude as U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= Ae i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ Dηe im 2ℏ T∫ 0 dt( ˙η2−ω2η2) , (3.19) wherewehaveidentiﬁed thetimeintervalwith T = tf − ti . (3.20) The variable η(t) satisﬁes the boundary conditions (see Eq. (3.8)) η(0) = η(T )=0 . (3.21) Consequently, the value of the ﬂuctuation at any point on the tra- jectory can be represented as a Fourier series of the form η(t)= ∑ n an sin ( nπt T ) ,n =1, 2,...,N − 1 . (3.22) We note here that since we have chosen to divide the trajectory into N intervals, namely, since there are (N −1) intermediate time points, there can only be (N − 1) independent coeﬃcients an in the Fourier expansion in Eq. (3.22). Substituting this back, we ﬁnd that T∫ 0 dt ˙η2 = ∑ n,m T∫ 0 dtanam ( nπ T )( mπ T ) cos( nπt T )cos( mπt T ) = T 2 ∑ n ( nπ T )2 a2 n , (3.23) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 50 40 3 Harmonic oscillator where we have used the orthonormality properties of the cosine func- tions. Similarly, we also obtain T∫ 0 dtη2(t)= ∑ n,m T∫ 0 dtanam sin ( nπt T ) sin ( mπt T ) = T 2 ∑ n a2 n . (3.24) Furthermore, we note that integrating over all possible conﬁgurations of η(t) or all possible quantum ﬂuctuations is equivalent to integrat- ing over all possible values of the coeﬃcients of expansion an.Thus we can write the transition amplitude also as U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ A′e i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ da1 ··· daN −1 e im 2ℏ N −1∑ n=1 ( T 2 ( nπ T )2 a2 n− T 2 ω2a2 n) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ A′e i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ da1 ··· daN −1 e imT 4ℏ N −1∑ n=1 (( nπ T )2−ω2)a2 n . (3.25) Here we note that any possible factor arising from the Jacobian in the change of variables from η to the coeﬃcients an has been lumped into A′ whose form we will determine shortly. We note here that the transition amplitude, in this case, is a product of a set of decoupled integrals each of which has the form of a Gaussian integral that can be easily evaluated. In fact, the individual integrals have the values (see Eq. (2.41)) ∫ dan e imT 4ℏ (( nπ T )2−ω2)a2 n = ( 4πiℏ mT ) 1 2 (( nπ T )2 − ω2)− 1 2 = ( 4πiℏ mT ) 1 2 ( nπ T )−1 ( 1 − ( ωT nπ )2)− 1 2 . (3.26) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 51 3.2 Method of Fourier transform 41 Substituting this form of the individual integrals into the expression for the transition amplitude in Eq. (3.25), we obtain (A′′ contains the additional constant factors) U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ A′′e i ℏ S[xcl] N −1∏ n=1 ( 1 − ( ωT nπ )2)− 1 2 . (3.27) If we now use the identity, lim N →∞ N −1∏ n=1 ( 1 − ( ωT nπ )2) = sin ωT ωT , (3.28) we obtain U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ A′′e i ℏ S[xcl] ( sin ωT ωT )− 1 2 . (3.29) We can determine the constant A′′ by simply noting that when ω =0, the harmonic oscillator reduces to a free particle for which we have already evaluated the transition amplitude. In fact, recalling from Eq. (2.57) that UF.P.(xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= ( m 2πiℏ (tf − ti) ) 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] , (3.30) and comparing with Eq. (3.29), we obtain lim ϵ→0 N →∞ A′′ = ( m 2πiℏT ) 1 2 . (3.31) Therefore, we determine the complete form of the transition ampli- tude for the harmonic oscillator to be U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= ( m 2πiℏT ) 1 2 ( sin ωT ωT )− 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] = ( mω 2πiℏ sin ωT ) 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] . (3.32) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 52 42 3 Harmonic oscillator It is quite straightforward to see that this expression indeed reduces to the transition amplitude for the free particle in the limit of ω → 0. 3.3 Matrix method If the evaluation of the path integral by the method of Fourier trans- forms appears less satisfactory in any way, then let us evaluate the path integral in the conventional manner by discretizing the time interval. Let us parameterize time on the trajectory as tn = ti + nϵ, n =0, 1,...,N, t0 = ti,tN = tf . Correspondingly, let us deﬁne the values of the ﬂuctuations at these points as η(tn)= ηn . (3.33) Then, we can write the transition amplitude in Eq. (3.19) in the explicit form U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= Ae i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ Dηe im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dt ( ˙η2−ω2η2) =lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ dη1 ··· dηN −1 × e imϵ 2ℏ N∑ n=1 (( ηn−ηn−1 ϵ )2−ω2( ηn+ηn−1 2 )2) . (3.34) In this expression, we are supposed to identify η0 = ηN =0 , (3.35) corresponding to the boundary conditions in Eq. (3.8), namely, η(ti)= η(tf )=0 . January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 53 3.3 Matrix method 43 To simplify the integral, let us rescale the variables as ηn → ( m 2ℏϵ )− 1 2 ηn . (3.36) The transition amplitude, in this case, will take the form U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ( 2ℏϵ m ) N −1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ dη1 ··· dηN −1 × ei N∑ n=1 ((ηn−ηn−1)2− ϵ2ω2 4 (ηn+ηn−1)2) . (3.37) If we think of the ηn’s (there are (N − 1) of them) as forming a column matrix, namely, η = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ η1 η2 ... ηN −1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , (3.38) then, we can also write the transition amplitude in terms of matrices as U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ( 2ℏϵ m ) N −1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] × ∫ dηeiηT Bη . (3.39) Here ηT represents the transpose of the column matrix in Eq. (3.38) and the (N − 1) × (N − 1) matrix B has the form B = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ 2 −100 ··· −12 −10 ··· 0 −12 −1 ··· ... ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ − ϵ2ω2 4 ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ 2100 ··· 1210 ··· 0121 ··· ... ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ . (3.40) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 54 44 3 Harmonic oscillator This is a symmetric matrix and, therefore, we can write it as B = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ xy 00 ··· yx y 0 ··· 0 yx y ··· ... ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , (3.41) wherewehavedeﬁned x =2 (1 − ϵ2ω2 4 ) , y = − (1+ ϵ2ω2 4 ) . (3.42) The matrix B is clearly Hermitian (both x and y are real) and, therefore, can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix (more precisely by an orthogonal matrix) which we denote by U . In other words, BD = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ b1 00 ··· 0 b2 0 ··· 00 b3 ··· ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ = U BU † . (3.43) Therefore, deﬁning a new vector ζ = U η, (3.44) we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 55 3.3 Matrix method 45 ∫ dηeiηT Bη = ∫ dζeiζT BDζ = ∫ dζ1 ··· dζN −1 ei N −1∑ n=1 bnζ2 n = N −1∏ n=1 ( iπ bn ) 1 2 =(iπ) N −1 2 (det B)− 1 2 . (3.45) Here we have used the familiar fact that the Jacobian for a change of variables by a unitary matrix is unity. Using this result in Eq. (3.39), therefore, we determine the form of the transition amplitude for the harmonic oscillator to be U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) N 2 ( 2ℏϵ m ) N −1 2 (iπ) N −1 2 (det B)− 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ ) 1 2 (det B)− 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ det B ) 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] . (3.46) It is clear from this analysis that the transition amplitude can be deﬁned only if the matrix B does not have any vanishing eigenvalue. We note here that the main quantity to calculate in order to determine the transition amplitude is lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵ det B. Let us note from the special structure of B in Eqs. (3.41) and (3.42), that if we denote the determinant of the n × n sub-matrices of B as In, then it is easy to check that they satisfy the recursion relation January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 56 46 3 Harmonic oscillator In+1 = xIn − y2In−1,n =0, 1, 2,... , (3.47) where we restrict I−1 =0,I0 =1 . (3.48) This recursion relation can be checked trivially for low orders of the matrix determinants. Substituting the form of x and y, we obtain In+1 =2 (1 − ϵ2ω2 4 ) In − (1+ ϵ2ω2 4 )2 In−1, or,In+1 − 2In + In−1 = − ϵ2ω2 2 (In + In−1 + ϵ2ω2 8 In−1 ) , or, In+1 − 2In + In−1 ϵ2 = − ω2 2 (In + In−1 + ϵ2ω2 8 In−1 ) . (3.49) We are, of course, interested in the continuum limit. In order to do so, let us deﬁne a function φ(tn − ti)= φ(nϵ)= ϵIn . (3.50) In the continuum limit, we can think of this as a continuous function φ(t)of t. In other words, we can identify t = nϵ as a continuous variable as ϵ → 0. We note then, that lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵ det B = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵIN −1 = φ(tf − ti)= φ(T ) . (3.51) We also note from Eqs. (3.48) and (3.50) that, in the continuum limit, φ(0) = lim ϵ→0 ϵI0 = lim ϵ→0 ϵ =0 , (3.52) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 57 3.3 Matrix method 47 and similarly, ˙φ(0) = lim ϵ→0 ϵ ( I1 − I0 ϵ ) = lim ϵ→0 (x − 1) = lim ϵ→0 (2 − ϵ2ω2 2 − 1) =1 . (3.53) Furthermore, from the recursion relation for the In’s in Eq. (3.49), we conclude that in the limit ϵ → 0, the function φ(t) satisﬁes the second order diﬀerential equation d2φ(t) dt2 = −ω2φ(t) . (3.54) We recognize this to be the harmonic oscillator equation and the solution subject to the initial conditions (Eqs. (3.52) and (3.53)) is clearly φ(t)= sin ωt ω . (3.55) It now follows from this that lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵ det B = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵIN −1 = φ(T )= sin ωT ω . (3.56) Consequently, for the harmonic oscillator, we obtain the transition amplitude in Eq. (3.46) to be U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ( m 2πiℏϵ det B ) 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] = ( mω 2πiℏ sin ωT ) 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] . (3.57) This is, of course, what we had already derived in Eq. (3.32) using the method of Fourier transforms. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 58 48 3 Harmonic oscillator Let us next describe an alternate way of determining (ϵ det B) which is quite useful in studying some speciﬁc problems. Let us recall from Eq. (3.47) that the determinant of the n×n matrices, In,satisfy the recursion relations In+1 = xIn − y2In−1 . We note here that we can write these recursion relations also in the simple matrix form as ( In+1 In ) = ( x −y2 10 )( In In−1 ) . (3.58) Iterating this (N − 2) times, for n = N − 2, we obtain ( IN −1 IN −2 ) = ( x −y2 10 ) ··· ︸ ︷︷ ︸ (N −2) factors ( I1 I0 ) = ( x −y2 10 )(N −2) ( x 1 ) . (3.59) We can determine the eigenvalues of the fundamental 2 × 2 matrix in Eq. (3.59) in a straightforward manner. From det ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ x − λ −y2 1 −λ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ =0 , we obtain λ2 − λx + y2 =0, or,λ± = x ± √ x2 − 4y2 2 . (3.60) Furthermore, the 2 × 2 matrix can be trivially diagonalized by a similarity transformation. In fact, if we deﬁne January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 59 3.3 Matrix method 49 S = ( cλ+ dλ− cd ) , (3.61) with S −1 = 1 λ+ − λ− ⎛ ⎝ 1 c − λ− c − 1 d λ+ d ⎞ ⎠ , (3.62) where c and d are arbitrary parameters, then it is easy to check that ( x −y2 10 ) = S ( λ+ 0 0 λ− ) S −1. (3.63) Using this in Eq. (3.59), we obtain ( IN −1 IN −2 ) = S ( λN −2 + 0 0 λN −2 − ) S −1 ( x 1 ) . (3.64) We recall from Eq. (3.60) that x = λ+ + λ− . (3.65) Using this as well as the forms for S and S −1 in Eqs. (3.61) and (3.62), we obtain from Eq. (3.64) IN −1 = 1 λ+ − λ− (λN + − λN − ) . (3.66) We can easily check now that I−1 =0 , I0 =1 , I1 = 1 λ+ − λ− (λ2 + − λ2 −) = λ+ + λ− = x, (3.67) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 60 50 3 Harmonic oscillator which is consistent with our earlier observations in Eqs. (3.47) and (3.48). Let us next note from Eqs. (3.60) and (3.42) that λ+ − λ− = (x2 − 4y2) 1 2 = ( 4 (1 − ϵ2ω2 4 )2 − 4 (1+ ϵ2ω2 4 )2) 1 2 =(−4ϵ2ω2) 1 2 =2iϵω , λN + = ( x + √x2 − 4y2 2 )N = ⎛ ⎝ 2 (1 − ϵ2ω2 4 ) +2iϵω 2 ⎞ ⎠ N = (1+ iϵω + O (ϵ2))N ≃ (1 + iϵω)N , λN − = ( x − √x2 − 4y2 2 )N = ( 2(1 − ϵ2ω2 4 ) − 2iϵω 2 )N = (1 − iϵω + O (ϵ2))N ≃ (1 − iϵω)N . (3.68) Consequently, substituting these relations into Eq. (3.66), we obtain lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵIN −1 =lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵ 1 λ+ − λ− (λN + − λN − ) =lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵ 1 2iϵω ((1 + iϵω)N − (1 − iϵω)N ) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 61 3.4 The classical action 51 =lim ϵ→0 N →∞ 1 2iω ((1+ iωT N )N − (1 − iωT N )N ) = 1 2iω (eiωT − e−iωT ) = sin ωT ω . (3.69) Here T = tf − ti is the time interval between the initial and the ﬁnal times and this is, of course, what we had obtained earlier in Eq. (3.56), namely, that lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵ det B = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ϵIN −1 = sin ωT ω . (3.70) We note here that a diﬀerent sign for the square-root in λ+ − λ− in (3.68) would have still led to the same value for the determinant. In any case, we obtain the transition amplitude for the harmonic oscillator to be U (xf ,tf ; xi,ti)= ( mω 2πiℏ sin ωT ) 1 2 e i ℏ S[xcl] . (3.71) 3.4 The classical action Once again we see from Eq. (3.32) or (3.71) that the transition am- plitude has a generic form similar to the one found for the case of the free particle. Namely, it is proportional to e i ℏ S[xcl].A complete de- termination of the transition amplitude in this case, therefore, would require us to evaluate the classical action for the system. This can be done in a simple manner as follows. We recall that the Euler- Lagrange equation for the present system is given by (see Eq. (3.5)) m¨xcl + mω2xcl − J =0 . In other words, the classical trajectory is a solution of the inhomo- geneous diﬀerential equation ( d2 dt2 + ω2) xcl(t)= J(t) m . (3.72) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 62 52 3 Harmonic oscillator The general solution, obviously, would consist of a homogeneous and an inhomogeneous part and can be written as xcl(t)= xH(t)+ xI(t) , (3.73) where the homogeneous solution is of the form xH(t)= Aeiωt + Be−iωt , (3.74) with A and B arbitrary constants to be determined from the bound- ary conditions. To determine the inhomogeneous solution, we use the method of Green’s function. Here the Green’s function for Eq. (3.72) is deﬁned by the equation ( d2 dt2 + ω2) G(t − t′)= −δ(t − t′) . (3.75) It is clear that if we know the Green’s function G(t − t′), then the inhomogeneous solution can be written as xI(t)= − tf∫ ti dt′ G(t − t′) J(t′) m . (3.76) The Green’s function can be easily determined by transforming to the Fourier space. Deﬁning G(t − t ′)= ∫ dk 2π e−ik(t−t′)G(k) , δ(t − t′)= ∫ dk 2π e−ik(t−t′), (3.77) where G(k) is the Fourier transform of G(t − t′) (we are using here the conventional notation that the Fourier transform of the Green’s function is not deﬁned in the symmetric manner that we have intro- duced in (2.6) and (2.7)), and substituting these into Eq. (3.75) we obtain (note also from Eq. (2.6) that the Fourier transform in time January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 63 3.4 The classical action 53 is deﬁned with an opposite phase compared to that for the space coordinates) ( d2 dt2 + ω2) G(t − t′)= −δ(t − t′), or, 1 2π (−k2 + ω2) G(k)= − 1 2π , or,G(k)= 1 k2 − ω2 . (3.78) Consequently, the Green’s function takes the form G(t − t′)= ∫ dk 2π e−ik(t−t′)G(k) = ∫ dk 2π e−ik(t−t′) k2 − ω2 . (3.79) The integrand in Eq. (3.79) clearly has poles on the real axis at k = ±ω. Therefore, we must specify a contour in the complex k-plane in order to evaluate the integral. Normally, in classical me- chanics, the Green’s functions that are of fundamental interest are the retarded and the advanced Green’s functions. But the Green’s function that is of fundamental signiﬁcance in quantum theories is the Feynman Green’s function and corresponds to choosing a contour as shown in Fig. 3.1. Equivalently, it corresponds to deﬁning (see Eq. (3.78)) GF (k) = lim ϵ→0+ 1 k2 − ω2 + iϵ = lim δ→0+ 1 (k + ω − iδ)(k − ω + iδ) , (3.80) wherewehavedeﬁned δ = ϵ 2ω .

In other words, we can think of the Feynman Green’s function in Eq. (3.80) as the Fourier transform of the function which satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation (this would correspond to letting S → S + iϵm 2 ∫ dtx2 in the exponent, as we will see later, which would lead to a damping in the weight factor) lim ϵ→0+ ( d2 dt2 + ω2 − iϵ) GF (t − t′)= −δ(t − t′) . (3.82) We note here, for completeness, that the retarded and the advanced Green’s functions, in this language, correspond respectively to choos- ing the Fourier transforms as GR,A(k) = lim ϵ→0+ 1 (k ± iϵ)2 − ω2 , with the respective contours shown in Fig. 3.2. With the choice of contour for the Feynman Green’s function in Fig. 3.1, enclosing the contour in the lower half plane for t − t′ > 0, we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 65 3.4 The classical action 55 −ω − iϵ ω − iϵ −ω + iϵ ω + iϵ Im k Re k Im k Re k Figure 3.2: The left contour in the complex k-plane is associated with the retarded Green’s function while the right contour is that for the advanced Green’s function. G(+)(t − t′) = lim δ→0+ 1 2π ∫ dk e−ik(t−t′) (k + ω − iδ)(k − ω + iδ) = 1 2π (−2πi) e−iω(t−t′) 2ω = 1 2iω e−iω(t−t′) . (3.83) On the other hand, for t − t′ < 0, enclosing the contour in the upper half plane, we ﬁnd G(−)(t − t′) = lim δ→0+ 1 2π ∫ dk e−ik(t−t′) (k + ω − iδ)(k − ω + iδ) = 1 2π (2πi) eiω(t−t′) (−2ω) = 1 2iω eiω(t−t′) . (3.84) Thus, the Feynman Green’s function has the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 66 56 3 Harmonic oscillator GF (t − t′)= θ(t − t′)G(+)(t − t′)+ θ(t′ − t)G(−)(t − t′) = θ(t − t′) e−iω(t−t′) 2iω + θ(t′ − t) eiω(t−t′) 2iω . (3.85) Using this Green’s function in Eq. (3.76), we can now obtain the inhomogeneous solution as xI(t)= − tf∫ ti dt′ GF (t − t′) J(t′) m = − 1 m ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ t∫ ti dt′ e−iω(t−t′) 2iω J(t′)+ tf∫ t dt′ eiω(t−t′) 2iω J(t′) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ = − 1 2imω ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ t∫ ti dt′e−iω(t−t′)J(t′)+ tf∫ t dt′eiω(t−t′)J(t′) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ . (3.86) Thus, substituting Eqs. (3.74) and (3.86) into Eq. (3.73) we can write the classical trajectory as xcl(t)= xH(t)+ xI(t) = Aeiωt + Be−iωt − 1 2imω ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ t∫ ti dt′e−iω(t−t′)J(t′)+ tf∫ t dt′eiω(t−t′)J(t′) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ . (3.87) Imposing the boundary conditions January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 67 3.4 The classical action 57 xcl(ti)= xi = Aeiωti + Be−iωti − 1 2imω tf∫ ti dt′eiω(ti−t′)J(t′) , xcl(tf )= xf = Aeiωtf + Be−iωtf − 1 2imω tf∫ ti dt′e−iω(tf −t′)J(t′) , (3.88) we can solve for A and B in terms of the initial and the ﬁnal coordi- nates of the trajectory as A = 1 2i sin ωT [ (xf e−iωti − xie−iωtf ) + e−iωtf mω tf∫ ti dt′ sin ω(t′ − ti)J(t′)], B = 1 2i sin ωT [ (xieiωtf − xf eiωti) + eiωti mω tf∫ ti dt′ sin ω(tf − t′)J(t′)] . (3.89) Substituting these relations into Eq. (3.87), we determine the classi- cal trajectory to be xcl(t)= 1 sin ωT [xf sin ω(t − ti)+ xi sin ω(tf − t) + 1 2mω tf∫ ti dt′J(t′)(e−iωT cos ω(t − t′) − cos ω(tf + ti − t − t′))] January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 68 58 3 Harmonic oscillator − 1 2imω ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ t∫ ti dt′J(t′)e−iω(t−t′) + tf∫ t dt′J(t′)eiω(t−t′) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ . (3.90) We can now derive the classical action from Eqs. (3.2) and (3.1) in a straightforward manner to be S[xcl]= mω 2sin ωT [(x2 i + x2 f )cos ωT − 2xixf ] + xi sin ωT tf∫ ti dtJ(t)sin ω(tf − t)+ xf sin ωT tf∫ ti dtJ(t)sin ω(t − ti) − 1 mω sin ωT tf∫ ti dt t∫ ti dt′J(t)sin ω(tf − t)sin ω(t′ − ti)J(t′). (3.91) This, therefore, completes the derivation of the transition amplitude for the harmonic oscillator interacting with a time dependent exter- nal source. 3.5 References R. P. Feynman and A. R.

January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 69 Chapter 4 Generating functional 4.1 Euclidean rotation We have seen in Eq. (2.41) that the standard Gaussian integral (where the exponent is quadratic) is given by ∞∫ −∞ dxeiαx2 = ( iπ α ) 1 2 , (4.1) and it generalizes to the case of a n × n matrix as (see Eq. (3.45)) ∞∫ −∞ dηeiηT Aη = ( (iπ)n det A ) 1 2 , (4.2) provided A is a Hermitian matrix. In fact, we will now see explicitly that this result holds true even when we replace the Hermitian matrix A by a Hermitian operator. In other words, we will see that we can write ∫ Dηei tf∫ ti dtη(t)O(t)η(t) = N [det O(t)]− 1 2 , (4.3) where O(t) is a Hermitian operator and N a normalization constant whose explicit form is not important. To establish this identiﬁcation, let us go back to the harmonic oscillator and note that the quantity of fundamental importance in this case is given by the integral (see Eq. (3.17)) 59 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 70 60 4 Generating functional ∫ Dηe i ℏ tf∫ ti dt ( 1 2 m ˙η2− 1 2 mω2η2) = ∫ Dηe im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dt (˙η2−ω2η2) = ∫ Dηe− im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dtη(t)( d2 dt2 +ω2)η(t) , (4.4) with the boundary conditions η(ti)= η(tf )=0 . (4.5) The value of this integral was determined earlier (see Eq. (3.29)) to be A ′′ ( sin ωT ωT )− 1 2 , (4.6) where T = tf − ti represents the total time interval. We evaluated this integral earlier by carefully discretizing the time interval and calculating the determinant of a matrix (see Eqs. (3.34) and (3.39)) whose matrix elements were nothing other than the discrete form of the matrix elements of the operator in the exponent in Eq. (4.4). This would already justify our claim. But let us, in fact, calculate the determinant of the operator in the exponent of Eq. (4.4) explicitly and compare with the result obtained earlier. The ﬁrst problem that we face in evaluating the functional in- tegral is that the exponential in the integrand is oscillatory and, therefore, we have to deﬁne the integral in some manner. One can, of course, use the same trick as we employed earlier in deﬁning ordi- nary oscillatory Gaussian integrals (see Eq. (2.41)). Namely, let us deﬁne (we had commented on this earlier before Eq. (3.82)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 71 4.1 Euclidean rotation 61 ∫ Dηe im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dt (˙η2−ω2η2) = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ Dηe− im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dtη(t)( d2 dt2 +ω2−iϵ)η(t) . (4.7) This provides proper damping to the integrand and, as we will see, leads to the Feynman Green’s functions for the theory. In fact, as we have already seen in Eq. (3.82), the inverse of the operator in the exponent in Eq. (4.7) gives the Feynman Green’s function which plays the role of the causal propagator in the quantum theory. It is in this sense that one says that the path integral naturally incorporates causal boundary conditions. There is an alternate but equivalent way of deﬁning the path integral which is quite pleasing and which gives some sense of rigor to all the manipulations involving the path integral. Very simply, it corresponds to analytically continuing all the integrals to imaginary times in the complex t-plane as shown in Fig. 4.1. More explicitly, we let t →−iτ, τ real. (4.8) Im t Re t Figure 4.1: Euclidean rotation in the complex t-plane. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 72 62 4 Generating functional With this analytic continuation, the integral in Eq. (4.4) becomes ∫ Dηe− im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dtη(t)( d2 dt2 +ω2)η(t) → ∫ Dηe− m 2ℏ τf∫ τi dτη(τ )(− d2 dτ 2 +ω2)η(τ ) = N ′ ∫ Dηe− 1 2 τf∫ τi dτη(τ )(− d2 dτ 2 +ω2)η(τ ) . (4.9) Here we have scaled the variables in the last step and N ′ represents the Jacobian for the change of variables. Furthermore, we have to evaluate the integral in Eq. (4.9) subject to the boundary conditions η(τi)= η(τf )=0 . (4.10) The right hand side of Eq. (4.9) is now a well deﬁned quantity since the integrand is exponentially damped. (The analytically continued operator has a positive deﬁnite spectrum, as we will see shortly.) We can now evaluate this integral and at the end of our calculations, we are supposed to analytically continue back to real time by letting τ → it, t real . (4.11) From Eq. (4.9) we see that the quantity which we are inter- ested in is det(− d2 dτ 2 + ω2). Furthermore, this determinant has to be evaluated in the space of functions which satisfy the boundary conditions η(τi)= η(τf )=0 . (4.12) Therefore, we are basically interested in solving the eigenvalue equa- tion (− d2 dτ 2 + ω2) ψn = λnψn , (4.13) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 73 4.1 Euclidean rotation 63 subject to the boundary conditions in Eq. (4.10), namely, ψn(τi)= ψn(τf )=0. (4.14) The normalized eigenfunctions of Eq. (4.13) are easily obtained to be ψn(τ )= √ 2 (τf − τi) sin nπ(τ − τi) (τf − τi) , (4.15) with n a positive integer. The corresponding eigenvalues are given by λn = ( nπ τf − τi )2 + ω2 . (4.16) Thus, we see that the determinant of the operator in Eq. (4.9) or (4.13) has the form det (− d2 dτ 2 + ω2) = ∞∏ n=1 λn = ∞∏ n=1 (( nπ τf − τi )2 + ω2) = ∞∏ n=1 ( nπ τf − τi )2 ∞∏ n=1 ( 1+ ( ω(τf − τi) nπ )2) = B sinh ω(τf − τi) ω(τf − τi) , (4.17) where we have used a relation similar to the one given in Eq. (3.28) and B is a constant representing the ﬁrst product whose value can be absorbed into the normalization of the path integral. Analytically continuing this back to real time, we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 74 64 4 Generating functional det (− d2 dτ 2 + ω2) → det ( d2 dt2 + ω2) = A sin ω(tf − ti) ω(tf − ti) = A sin ωT ωT . (4.18) Here, as before, we have identiﬁed T = tf − ti with the total time interval and A denotes the constant B analytically continued to real time. This is, of course, related to the value of the path integral which we had obtained earlier in Eq. (3.32) through a careful evaluation. Therefore, we conclude that ∫ Dηe im 2ℏ tf∫ ti dt (˙η2−ω2η2) = A ′′ ( sin ωT ωT )− 1 2 = N (det ( d2 dt2 + ω2))− 1 2 . (4.19) Later, we will generalize this result to ﬁeld theories or systems with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. Let us next discuss in some detail the analytic continuation to the imaginary time. Consider a Minkowski space with coordinates xμ =(t, x) , where we leave the dimensionality of space arbitrary. Then, under the analytic continuation, xμ =(t, x) → (−iτ, x), x2 =(t2 − x2) →−(τ 2 + x2) − x2 E . (4.20) Therefore, we note that τ is nothing other than the Euclidean time. The analytic continuation, consequently, corresponds to a rotation from Minkowski space to Euclidean space. (Although, in one di- mension, it does not make sense to talk about a Euclidean space, in January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 75 4.1 Euclidean rotation 65 higher dimensional ﬁeld theories it is quite meaningful.) The sense of the rotation is completely ﬁxed by the singularity structure of the theory. Let us note that an analytic continuation is meaningful only if no singularity is crossed in the process. We know from our study of the Feynman Green’s function in the last chapter (see Eq. (3.80)) that in the complex energy plane, the singularities occur at points shown in Fig. 4.2. Im k0 Re k0 −ω + iδ ω − iδ Figure 4.2: Euclidean rotation in the complex energy plane. The crosses denote the location of poles of the Feynman Green’s function. Therefore, it is clear that an analytic continuation from Re k0 to Im k0 is meaningful only if the rotation is anti-clockwise as shown in Fig. 4.2, namely, only if we let k0 → iκ, κ real . (4.21) Since we can represent k0 → iℏ ∂ ∂t , (4.22) it follows now that in the complex t-plane, the consistent rotation will be t →−iτ, τ real . (4.23) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 76 66 4 Generating functional Namely, in this case, we will have k0 → iℏ ∂ ∂t → iℏ ∂ ∂(−iτ ) = i (iℏ ∂ ∂τ ) → iκ. 4.2 Time ordered correlation functions Let us recapitulate quickly what we have done so far. We have obtained the transition amplitude in the form of a path integral as H⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩H = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] . (4.24) Let us next consider the product of two coordinate operators of the form (the order of the operators is important since coordinate oper- ators at diﬀerent times need not commute) XH(t1)XH(t2) ,t1 >t2, (4.25) and evaluate the matrix element H⟨xf ,tf |XH(t1)XH(t2)|xi,ti⟩H,tf ≥ t1 >t2 ≥ ti . (4.26) Since t1 >t2, then we can insert complete sets of coordinate basis states and write H⟨xf ,tf |XH(t1)XH(t2)|xi,ti⟩H = ∫ dx1dx2 H⟨xf ,tf |XH(t1)|x1,t1⟩H × H⟨x1,t1|XH(t2)|x2,t2⟩HH⟨x2,t2|xi,ti⟩H = ∫ dx1dx2 x1x2 H⟨xf ,tf |x1,t1⟩H × H⟨x1,t1|x2,t2⟩HH⟨x2,t2|xi,ti⟩H . (4.27) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 77 4.2 Time ordered correlation functions 67 Here we have used the relation in Eq. (1.44). We note that each inner product in the integrand represents a transition amplitude and, therefore, can be written as a path integral. Combining the products, we can write (for t1 >t2) H⟨xf ,tf |XH(t1)XH(t2)|xi,ti⟩H = N ∫ Dxx(t1)x(t2) e i ℏ S[x] . (4.28) Here we have used the identiﬁcation x1 = x(t1),x2 = x(t2) , (4.29) and we note that the path integral (4.28) should be viewed in the sense of (4.27). Namely, the system evolves in time from (xi,ti)to (x2,t2) where an insertion of a factor x2 is made. Then the system evolves from (x2,t2)to(x1,t1) where a second insertion of a factor x1 is made. Finally, the system evolves from (x1,t1)to(xf ,tf )and we integrate over x1,x2, namely, over all possible locations for the insertions. Similarly, we note that for t2 >t1, we can write H⟨xf ,tf |XH(t2)XH(t1)|xi,ti⟩H = ∫ dx1dx2 H⟨xf ,tf |XH(t2)|x2,t2⟩H × H⟨x2,t2|XH(t1)|x1,t1⟩HH⟨x1,t1|xi,ti⟩H = N ∫ Dxx(t1)x(t2) e i ℏ S[x] . (4.30) In the last step, we have used the fact that factors in the integrand such as x(t1)and x(t2) are classical quantities and, therefore, their product is commutative. Thus, we see from Eqs. (4.28) and (4.30) that the path integral naturally gives the time ordered correlation functions as the moments H⟨xf ,tf |T (XH(t1)XH(t2))|xi,ti⟩H = N ∫ Dxx(t1)x(t2) e i ℏ S[x] , (4.31) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 78 68 4 Generating functional where the time ordering is deﬁned as T (XH(t1)XH(t2)) = θ(t1 − t2)XH(t1)XH(t2)+ θ(t2 − t1)XH(t2)XH(t1) . (4.32) In fact, it is obvious now that the time ordered product of any set of operators leads to correlation functions in the path integral formalism as H⟨xf ,tf |T (O1(XH(t1)) ··· On(XH(tn)))|xi,ti⟩H = N ∫ DxO1(x(t1)) ··· On(x(tn))e i ℏ S[x] . (4.33) Furthermore, the beauty of path integrals lies in the fact that all the factors on the right hand side are c-numbers (classical quantities). There are no operators any more. 4.3 Correlation functions in deﬁnite states So far, we have calculated the transition amplitude between two co- ordinate states. In physical applications, however, we are often in- terested in transitions between physical states. Namely, we would like to know the probability amplitude for a system in a state |ψi⟩H at time ti to make a transition to a state |ψf ⟩H at time tf .This is what the S-matrix elements are supposed to give. Let us note that by deﬁnition, this transition amplitude is given by H⟨ψf |ψi⟩H = ∫ dxf dxi H⟨ψf |xf ,tf ⟩HH⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩HH⟨xi,ti|ψi⟩H = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ f (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] . (4.34) Here we have used the standard deﬁnition of the wavefunction. Namely, H⟨x, t|ψ⟩H = ψ(x, t) . (4.35) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 79 4.3 Correlation functions in definite states 69 We comment here, parenthetically, that a Heisenberg state is independent of time, it will not change with time unless there is a perturbation. However, if a system in the state |ψi⟩H is subjected to an external perturbation like the interaction with an external source (for a ﬁnite amount of time), it can make a transition to another state |ψf ⟩H. Of course, it will also have a ﬁnite transition amplitude for remaining in the same state. It is in that sense that we are talking about a transition. Following our earlier discussion (see Eq. (4.33)), we see that the time ordered correlation functions between such physical states can also be written as (ti ≤ t1,t2, ··· ,tn ≤ tf ) H⟨ψf |T (O1(XH(t1)) ··· On(XH(tn)))|ψi⟩H = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ f (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) × ∫ DxO1(x(t1)) ··· On(x(tn))e i ℏ S[x] . (4.36) In dealing with physical systems, we are often interested in cal- culating expectation values of operators in a given state (a better way to say is the normalized correlations in the transition from |ψi⟩H to |ψi⟩H, but we will use the sloppy language here for convenience). This is simply obtained by noting that (ti ≤ t1,t2, ··· ,tn ≤ tf ) H⟨ψi|T (O1(XH(t1)) ··· On(XH(tn)))|ψi⟩H = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) × ∫ DxO1(x(t1)) ··· On(x(tn))e i ℏ S[x] . (4.37) Since the states need not necessarily be normalized, we obtain the expectation value to be ⟨T (O1(XH(t1)) ··· On(XH(tn)))⟩ January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 80 70 4 Generating functional = H⟨ψi|T (O1(XH(t1)) ··· On(XH(tn)))|ψi⟩H H⟨ψi|ψi⟩H (4.38) = ∫ dxf dxiψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti)∫ DxO1(x(t1)) ··· On(x(tn))e i ℏ S[x] ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] . Note that the normalization constant N cancels out in the ratio and it is for this reason that we do not often worry about the explicit form of the normalization constant. In most ﬁeld theory questions one is primarily interested in calculating the expectation values of time ordered products of operators in the ground state and, con- sequently, one tends to be sloppy about this factor in such cases. (We comment here that the true expectation value of any opera- tor can not be calculated within Feynman’s path integral formalism where time ﬂows forward. Rather, one needs Schwinger’s formalism of closed time path formalism which allows time to run forwards as well as backwards. We will not discuss this in this book. It is better discussed in books on ﬁnite temperature ﬁeld theory.) From now on let us suppress, for convenience, the subscript H signifying the description in the Heisenberg picture. Let us next note that we can generate various correlation functions in a simple way in the path integral formalism by adding appropriate external sources. Thus, for example, if we want matrix elements of a product of the coordinate operators, we can deﬁne a modiﬁed action of the form (source coupled linearly to the dynamical variable whose correlations we are interested in) S[x, J]= S[x]+ tf∫ ti dtx(t)J(t) , (4.39) where J(t) denotes an external source and this action satisﬁes S[x, 0] = S[x] , (4.40) where S[x] deﬁnes the dynamics of the system. Let us further deﬁne ⟨ψi|ψi⟩J = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x,J] . (4.41) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 81 4.3 Correlation functions in definite states 71 Clearly, then, ⟨ψi|ψi⟩J=0 = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] = ⟨ψi|ψi⟩ . (4.42) It is clear now from Eqs. (4.39) and (4.41) that (tf ≥ t1 ≥ ti) δ⟨ψi|ψi⟩J δJ(t1) = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dx i ℏ δS[x, J] δJ(t1) e i ℏ S[x,J] = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dx i ℏ x(t1) e i ℏ S[x,J]. (4.43) It follows, therefore, that δ⟨ψi|ψi⟩J δJ(t1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dx i ℏ x(t1)e i ℏ S[x] = i ℏ ⟨ψi|X(t1)|ψi⟩ , (4.44) where we have used the relation in Eq. (4.37). Similarly, for tf ≥ t1,t2 ≥ ti,wehave δ2⟨ψi|ψi⟩J δJ(t1)δJ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) × ∫ Dx ( i ℏ )2 δS[x, J] δJ(t1) δS[x, J] δJ(t2) e i ℏ S[x,J]∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 82 72 4 Generating functional = N ∫ dxf dxi ψ∗ i (xf ,tf )ψi(xi,ti) ∫ Dx ( i ℏ )2x(t1)x(t2)e i ℏ S[x] = ( i ℏ )2 ⟨ψi|T (X(t1)X(t2))|ψi⟩ . (4.45) In general, it is quite straightforward to show that δn⟨ψi|ψi⟩J δJ(t1) ··· δJ(tn) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = ( i ℏ )n ⟨ψi|T (X(t1) ··· X(tn))|ψi⟩ . (4.46) Consequently, we can write the normalized time ordered correlations in the state |ψi⟩ as ⟨T (X(t1) ··· X(tn))⟩ = ⟨ψi|T (X(t1) ··· X(tn))|ψi⟩ ⟨ψi|ψi⟩ = (−iℏ)n ⟨ψi|ψi⟩J δn⟨ψi|ψi⟩J δJ(t1) ··· δJ(tn) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 . (4.47) It is for this reason that ⟨ψi|ψi⟩J is also known as the generating functional for the time ordered correlation functions in a given state. 4.4 Vacuum functional An object of great interest in quantum ﬁeld theories is the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude in the presence of an external source. The simplest way to obtain this is to go back to the deﬁnition of the transition amplitude in the coordinate space ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩J = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x,J] = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x]+ i ℏ tf∫ ti dtJ(t)x(t) . (4.48) It is clear from our earlier discussion in Eq. (4.33) that we can also think of this quantity as the matrix element of the operator January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 83 4.4 Vacuum functional 73 ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩J = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x,J] = ⟨xf ,tf |T ⎛ ⎜ ⎝e i ℏ tf∫ ti dtJ(t)X(t)⎞ ⎟ ⎠ |xi,ti⟩ . (4.49) Let us next take the limits ti →−∞,tf →∞ . (4.50) That is, let us calculate the amplitude for the system to make a transition from the coordinate state in the inﬁnite past labeled by the coordinate xi to the coordinate state in the inﬁnite future labeled by the coordinate xf in the presence of an external source which switches on adiabatically. We will enforce the adiabatic condition by assuming that the external source is nonzero within a large but ﬁnite interval of time. That is, let us assume that J(t)=0, for |t| >τ, (4.51) where τ is assumed to be large and we will take the limit τ →∞ at the end. In such a case, we can write lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩J = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt (L(x, ˙x)+Jx) . (4.52) Alternatively, we can write from Eq. (4.49) lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩J = lim τ →∞ lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ⟨xf ,tf |T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ τ∫ −τ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |xi,ti⟩. (4.53) Let us further assume that the ground state energy of our Hamil- tonian is normalized to zero so that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 84 74 4 Generating functional H|0⟩ =0, H|n⟩ = En|n⟩,En > 0 . (4.54) (We wish to point out here that in a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, Poincar´e invariance requires that Pμ|0⟩ =0 , (4.55) which leads to a vanishing ground state energy. In quantum me- chanics, however, the ground state energy does not vanish in general and in such a case, the asymptotic limits are not well deﬁned and the present derivation becomes involved. Therefore, for simplicity we choose a derivation parallel to that of a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory and assume that the ground state energy is zero (we basically have to add a constant to the quantum theory to make the ground state energy vanish and this can be done since only diﬀerences of en- ergy levels are measurable).) Although for simplicity of discussion we have assumed the energy eigenstates to be discrete, it is not essential for our arguments. Introducing complete sets of energy eigenstates into the transition amplitude, we obtain lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩J = lim τ →∞ lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ∑ n,m⟨xf ,tf |n⟩⟨n|T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ τ∫ −τ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |m⟩⟨m|xi,ti⟩ = lim τ →∞ lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ∑ n,m⟨xf |e− i ℏ Htf |n⟩⟨n|T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ τ∫ −τ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |m⟩⟨m|e i ℏ Hti|xi⟩ = lim τ →∞ lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ∑ n,m e− i ℏ Entf + i ℏ Emti⟨xf |n⟩⟨n|T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ τ∫ −τ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |m⟩⟨m|xi⟩, (4.56) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 85 4.4 Vacuum functional 75 where we have used Eqs. (1.45) and (4.54). In the limit ti →−∞ and tf →∞, the exponentials oscillate out to zero except for the ground state where the energy is zero. One can alternatively see this also by looking at the exponentials in a regularized manner or by analytically continuing to the imaginary time axis (Euclidean space in the case of ﬁeld theories). Thus, in this asymptotic limit, we obtain lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩J = lim τ →∞⟨xf |0⟩⟨0|T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ τ∫ −τ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |0⟩⟨0|xi⟩ = ⟨xf |0⟩⟨0|xi⟩⟨0|T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |0⟩ . (4.57) Consequently, we can write ⟨0|T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |0⟩ = lim ti→−∞ tf →∞ ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩J ⟨xf |0⟩⟨0|xi⟩ . (4.58) The left hand side is independent of the end points and, therefore, the right hand side must also be independent of the end points. Fur- thermore, the right hand side has the structure of a path integral and we can write Eq. (4.58) also as ⟨0|T ⎛ ⎝e i ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dtJX ⎞ ⎠ |0⟩ = ⟨0|0⟩J = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x,J] , (4.59) without the end point constraints and with S[x, J]= ∞∫ −∞ dt (L(x, ˙x)+ Jx) . (4.60) Let us note that if we deﬁne Z[J]= ⟨0|0⟩J = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x,J] , (4.61) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 86 76 4 Generating functional then, it follows from Eq. (4.47) that, in the vacuum state, ⟨T (X(t1) ··· X(tn))⟩ = (−iℏ)n Z[J] δnZ[J] δJ(t1) ··· δJ(tn) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 . (4.62) Namely, Z[J] generates time ordered correlation functions or the Green’s functions in the vacuum. If one knows all the vacuum Green’s functions, one can construct all the elements of the Scattering matrix of the theory and, therefore, can solve the theory. In quantum ﬁeld theory, therefore, these correlation functions or the vacuum Green’s functions play a central role. Z[J] is correspondingly known as the vacuum functional or the generating functional for vacuum Green’s functions. In quantum mechanics, we are often interested in various sta- tistical deviations from the mean values. These can also be obtained in the path integral formalism in the following way. Let us deﬁne Z[J]= e i ℏ W [J], or,W [J]= −iℏ ln Z[J] . (4.63) We have already seen in the case of the free particle as well as the harmonic oscillator that the path integral for the transition ampli- tude is proportional to the exponential of the classical action (see Eqs. (2.57) and (3.32)). It is for this reason that W [J] is also called an eﬀective action. Let us note that by deﬁnition δW [J] δJ(t1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =(−iℏ) 1 Z[J] δZ[J] δJ(t1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = ⟨X(t1)⟩ , (4.64) where ⟨· · · ⟩ stands for the vacuum expectation value (vacuum corre- lation function) from now on. Next, we note that (−iℏ) δ2W [J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =(−iℏ)2 ( 1 Z[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2) − 1 Z2[J] δZ[J] δJ(t1) δZ[J] δJ(t2) )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 87 4.4 Vacuum functional 77 = ⟨T (X(t1)X(t2))⟩−⟨X(t1)⟩⟨X(t2)⟩ = ⟨T ((X(t1) −⟨X(t1)⟩)(X(t2) −⟨X(t2)⟩))⟩ . (4.65) We recognize this to be the second order deviation from the mean and we note that we can similarly, obtain (−iℏ)2 δ3W [J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2)δJ(t3) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =(−iℏ)3 ( 1 Z[J] δ3Z[J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2)δJ(t3) − 1 Z2[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2) δZ[J] δJ(t3) − 1 Z2[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(t3)δJ(t1) δZ[J] δJ(t2) − 1 Z2[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(t2)δJ(t3) δZ[J] δJ(t1) + 2 Z3 δZ[J] δJ(t1) δZ[J] δJ(t2) δZ[J] δJ(t3) )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = ⟨T (X(t1)X(t2)X(t3))⟩−⟨T (X(t1)X(t2))⟩⟨X(t3)⟩ −⟨T (X(t3)X(t1))⟩⟨X(t2)⟩−⟨T (X(t2)X(t3))⟩⟨X(t1)⟩ +2⟨X(t1)⟩⟨X(t2)⟩⟨X(t3)⟩ (4.66) = ⟨T ((X(t1) −⟨X(t1)⟩)(X(t2) −⟨X(t2)⟩)(X(t3) −⟨X(t3)⟩))⟩ . We can go on and the expressions start to take a more complicated form starting with the fourth functional derivative of the eﬀective action W [J]. However, W [J] can still be shown to generate various statistical deviations and their moments. In quantum ﬁeld theory, W [J] is known as the generating functional for the connected vacuum Green’s functions. Let us next go back to the example of the harmonic oscillator which we have studied in some detail. In this case, the generating functional is given by Z[J]= N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x,J] , (4.67) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 88 78 4 Generating functional where S[x, J]= ∞∫ −∞ dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 − 1 2 mω2x2 + Jx) . (4.68) Obviously, in this case, we have ⟨X(t1)⟩ =(−iℏ) 1 Z[J] δZ[J] δJ(t1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = N ∫ Dxx(t1) e i ℏ S[x] N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] =0 . (4.69) This vanishes because the integrand in the numerator is odd. There- fore, for the harmonic oscillator, we obtain from Eqs. (4.62) and (4.65) that ⟨T (X(t1)X(t2))⟩ =(−iℏ)2 1 Z[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =(−iℏ) δ2W [J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 . (4.70) Let us also note that because the action for the harmonic oscil- lator is quadratic in the dynamical variables, we can write Z[J]= N ∫ Dxe i ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt( 1 2 m ˙x2− 1 2 mω2x2+Jx) = lim ϵ→0+N ∫ Dxe− im 2ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt (x(t)( d2 dt2 +ω2−iϵ)x(t)− 2 m J(t)x(t)). (4.71) This a Gaussian integral (involving an operator) and let us recall from (see Eq. (3.82)) that lim ϵ→0+ ( d2 dt2 + ω2 − iϵ) GF (t − t′)= −δ(t − t′) . (4.72) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 89 4.4 Vacuum functional 79 Using this, we can deﬁne (this is the generalization of completing the square to the case of a Gaussian involving operators) ˜x(t)= x(t)+ 1 m ∞∫ −∞ dt′ GF (t − t′)J(t′) , (4.73) and the generating functional then takes the form Z[J] = lim ϵ→0+ N ∫ D˜xe− im 2ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt ˜x(t)( d2 dt2 +ω2−iϵ)˜x(t) × e− i 2ℏm ∞∫∫ −∞ dt dt′J(t)GF (t−t′)J(t′) = lim ϵ→0+ N [det( d2 dt2 + ω2 − iϵ)]− 1 2 × e− i 2ℏm ∞∫∫ −∞ dt dt′ J(t)GF (t−t′)J(t′) = Z[0] e− i 2ℏm ∞∫∫ −∞ dt dt′ J(t)GF (t−t′)J(t′) , (4.74) wherewehaveidentiﬁed Z[0] = N det [det( d2 dt2 + ω2 − iϵ)]− 1 2 . We now obtain in a straightforward manner δ2Z[J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = − i ℏm GF (t1 − t2)Z[0] . (4.75) Consequently, for the harmonic oscillator, we have (see Eq. (4.70)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 90 80 4 Generating functional ⟨T (X(t1)X(t2))⟩ =(−iℏ)2 1 Z[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(t1)δJ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =(−iℏ)2 (− i ℏm ) GF (t1 − t2)= iℏ m GF (t1 − t2) . (4.76) In other words, the two-point time ordered vacuum correlation func- tion, in the present case, gives the Feynman Green’s function. This is a general feature of all quantum mechanical theories, namely, that the two-point connected vacuum Green’s function is nothing other than the Feynman propagator of the theory. 4.5 Anharmonic oscillator Just as there are a handful of quantum mechanical systems which can be solved analytically, similarly, there are only a few path integrals that can be evaluated exactly. (There is a one to one correspondence between the quantum mechanical problems that can be analytically solved and the path integrals that can be exactly evaluated.) The Gaussian (recall the free particle and the harmonic oscillator) is the simplest of the path integrals which can be exactly evaluated. How- ever, we also know that if we perturb the harmonic oscillator even slightly by an additional interaction, say a quartic interaction, the problem cannot be solved analytically. In other words, the quantum mechanical system corresponding to the Lagrangian L = 1 2 m ˙x2 − 1 2 mω2x2 − λ 4 x4,λ > 0 , (4.77) is impossible to solve exactly even when λ ≪ 1. (This model is known as the anharmonic oscillator and the restriction on the cou- pling constant, λ> 0, ensures that the potential is bounded from below so that a ground state of the theory exists.) In such a case, we use perturbation theory and calculate corrections to the unper- turbed system in a power series in the coupling constant λ.In the Feynman path integral approach, the manifestation of this lies in the fact that the path integral corresponding to the Lagrangian for this anharmonic oscillator cannot be evaluated exactly and has to be calculated perturbatively in the following way. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 91 4.5 Anharmonic oscillator 81 Let us introduce an external source and write the vacuum func- tional for this theory as Z[J]= N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x,J] = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2− 1 2 mω2x2− λ 4 x4+Jx). (4.78) If we separate the action into a free (quadratic) part and an interac- tion part, we can write S[x, J]= S0[x, J] − λ 4 ∞∫ −∞ dtx4, (4.79) where S0[x, J]= ∞∫ −∞ dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 − 1 2 mω2x2 + Jx) , (4.80) is the action for the harmonic oscillator in the presence of a source. It follows now that δS0[x, J] δJ(t) = x(t), (4.81) leading to (−iℏ) δ δJ(t) e i ℏ S0[x,J] = δS0[x, J] δJ(t) e i ℏ S0[x,J] = x(t) e i ℏ S0[x,J]. (4.82) In other words, operationally we can identify (−iℏ) δ δJ(t) → x(t) , (4.83) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 92 82 4 Generating functional when the functional derivative acts on e i ℏ S0[x,J]. Now, we can use this identiﬁcation to write Z[J]= N ∫ Dx ⎛ ⎝e− iλ 4ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dtx4⎞ ⎠ e i ℏ S0[x,J] = N ∫ Dx ⎛ ⎝e− iλ 4ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt (−iℏ δ δJ(t) )4⎞ ⎠ e i ℏ S0[x,J] = ⎛ ⎝e− iλ 4ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt (−iℏ δ δJ(t) )4⎞ ⎠ N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S0[x,J] = ⎛ ⎝e− iλ 4ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt (−iℏ δ δJ(t) )4⎞ ⎠ Z0[J] , (4.84) where Z0[J] is the vacuum functional for the harmonic oscillator in- teracting with an external source. We have already seen in Eq. (4.74) that it has the form Z0[J]= Z0[0] e− i 2ℏm ∞∫∫ −∞ dt′ dt′′ J(t′)GF (t′−t′′)J(t′′). (4.85) Substituting this back then, we obtain Z[J]= Z0[0] ⎛ ⎝e− iλ 4ℏ ∞∫ −∞ dt (−iℏ δ δJ(t) )4⎞ ⎠ × e− i 2ℏm ∞∫∫ −∞ dt′ dt′′ J(t′)GF (t′−t′′)J(t′′). (4.86) It is clear that if λ is small, i.e., for weak coupling, we can Taylor expand the ﬁrst exponential and we will be able to obtain the vacuum functional as a power series in λ. Consequently, all the vacuum Green’s functions can be calculated perturbatively. This is basically perturbation theory within the framework of Feynman’s path integral and we will discuss more about it later.

They are described by quantum mechanical operators with very diﬀerent properties. The operators describing bosons, for example, obey commutation relations whereas the fermionic oper- ators (i.e., operators describing fermions) satisfy anti-commutation relations. As a preparation for such systems, let us study a prototype example, namely, the fermionic oscillator. There are many ways to introduce the fermionic oscillator. Let us discuss the one that is the most intuitive. Let us recall that the bosonic harmonic oscillator in one dimension with a natural fre- quency ω has the Hamiltonian which, written in terms of creation and annihilation operators, takes the form HB = ω 2 (a† BaB + aBa† B) . (5.1) Here, for simplicity, we are assuming that ℏ = 1. The creation and the annihilation operators are supposed to satisfy the commutation relations [aB,a† B] = aBa† B − a† BaB =1 , (5.2) with all others vanishing. The symmetric structure of the Hamilto- nian, in this case, is a reﬂection of the fact that we are dealing with Bose particles and, consequently, the states (or wave functions) must have a symmetric form. Fermionic systems, on the other hand, have an inherent anti- symmetry. Therefore, let us try a Hamiltonian for a fermionic oscil- lator with frequency ω of the form 85 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 96 86 5 Path integrals for fermions HF = ω 2 (a† F aF − aF a† F ) . (5.3) If aF and a† F were to satisfy commutation relations like the bosonic oscillator in Eq. (5.2), namely, if we had [aF ,a† F ] = aF a† F − a† F aF =1, (5.4) with all others vanishing, then using this, we can rewrite the fermionic Hamiltonian in Eq. (5.3) to be HF = ω 2 (a† F aF − (a† F aF +1)) = − ω 2 . (5.5) In other words, in such a case, there would be no dynamics asso- ciated with the Hamiltonian. Let us assume, therefore, that the fermionic operators aF and a† F instead satisfy anti-commutation re- lations. Namely, let [aF ,aF ]+ ≡ a2 F + a2 F =2a2 F =0 , [a† F ,a† F ] + ≡ (a† F )2 + (a† F )2 =2 (a† F )2 =0 , [aF ,a† F ] + ≡ aF a† F + a† F aF =1= [a† F ,aF ] + . (5.6) In contrast to the commutators, the anti-commutators are by deﬁni- tion symmetric. An immediate consequence of the anti-commutation relations in Eq. (5.6) is that in such a system, the particles (quanta) must obey Pauli exclusion principle (Fermi-Dirac statistics). To see this, let us note that if we identify the operators aF and a† F with the annihilation and creation operators for such a system, then we can deﬁne a number operator as usual as NF = a† F aF . (5.7) From the anti-commutation relations in Eq. (5.6) we note that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 97 5.1 Fermionic oscillator 87 N 2 F = a† F aF a† F aF = a† F (1 − a† F aF ) aF = a† F aF = NF , or,NF (NF − 1) = 0 . (5.8) Therefore, the eigenvalues of the number operator can only be zero or one. This is the reﬂection of the Pauli principle or the Fermi-Dirac statistics, namely, we can at the most have one fermion in a given quantum mechanical state. This shows that the anti-commutation relations are the natural choice for a fermionic system. Given this, let us rewrite the Hamiltonian for the fermionic oscillator in Eq. (5.3) as HF = ω 2 (a† F aF − (1 − a† F aF )) = ω(a† F aF − 1 2 ) = ω(NF − 1 2 ) . (5.9) We note that this has a form similar to the Hamiltonian of the bosonic oscillator except for the sign of the constant term (the zero point energy). Furthermore, the commutation relations between aF ,a† F and NF can now be calculated in a straightforward manner [aF ,NF ]= [aF ,a† F aF ] = [aF ,a† F ] + aF = aF , [a† F ,NF ] = [a† F ,a† F aF ] = −a† F [a† F ,aF ] + = −a† F . (5.10) (As a technical aside, we note here that a commutator involving products of operators can, of course, be written in terms of commu- tators, but can also be expressed in terms of anti-commutators. For example, [A, BC]= ABC − BCA =(AB + BA) C − B (AC + CA) =[A, B]+ C − B [A, C]+ , (5.11) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 98 88 5 Path integrals for fermions and this is what we have used in Eq. (5.10).) As a result, we can think of aF ,a† F as lowering and raising operators respectively. We note that if an eigenstate of NF is denoted by |nF ⟩,thenit satisﬁes NF |nF ⟩ = nF |nF ⟩ , (5.12) with nF =0, 1. The ground state with no quantum is denoted by |0⟩ and satisﬁes NF |0⟩ =0 , HF |0⟩ = ω (NF − 1 2 ) |0⟩ = − ω 2 |0⟩ . (5.13) Similarly, the state with one quantum is denoted by |1⟩ and satisﬁes NF |1⟩ = |1⟩ , HF |1⟩ = ω (NF − 1 2 ) |1⟩ = ω 2 |1⟩ . (5.14) The ground state is annihilated by aF and we have aF |0⟩ =0 , a† F |0⟩ = |1⟩ . (5.15) It is clear from the anti-commutation relations in Eq. (5.6) that a† F |1⟩ = a† F a† F |0⟩ =0 . (5.16) Therefore, the Hilbert space of the theory, in this case, is two dimen- sional and we note here that the ground state energy has opposite sign from the ground state energy (zero point energy) of a bosonic oscillator. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 99 5.2 Grassmann variables 89 5.2 Grassmann variables Since fermions have no classical analog, we cannot directly write down a Lagrangian for the fermionic oscillator in terms of the usual coordinates and momenta. Obviously, we need the notion of anti- commuting classical variables. (This is essential to develop the path integral for such systems since path integrals involve only classical variables.) Such variables have been well studied in mathematics and go under the name of Grassmann variables. As one can readily imagine, they have very uncommon properties and let us recall here only some of these properties which we will need for our discussions. For example, if θi,i =1, 2,...,n, deﬁne a set of Grassmann variables (classical), then they satisfy θiθj + θjθi =0,i, j =1, 2,...,n. (5.17) This, in particular, implies that for any given i, θ2 i =0,i not summed . (5.18) In other words, the Grassmann variables are nilpotent. This has the immediate consequence that if f (θ) is a function of only one Grassmann variable, then it has the simple Taylor expansion f (θ)= a + bθ . (5.19) Since θi’s are anti-commuting, the derivatives have to be deﬁned carefully in the sense that the direction in which the derivatives op- erate needs to be speciﬁed. Thus, for example, a right derivative for Grassmann variables would give ∂ ∂θi (θjθk)= θj ( ∂θk ∂θi ) − ( ∂θj ∂θi ) θk = δikθj − δijθk , (5.20) whereas a left derivative would lead to ∂ ∂θi (θjθk)= ( ∂θj ∂θi ) θk − θj ( ∂θk ∂θi ) = δijθk − δikθj . (5.21) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 100 90 5 Path integrals for fermions Thus, the sense of the derivative is crucial and in all our discussions involving Grassmann variables, we will use left derivatives. Let us note that like the Grassmann variables, the derivatives with respect to these variables also anti-commute. Namely, ∂ ∂θi ∂ ∂θj + ∂ ∂θj ∂ ∂θi =0 . (5.22) These derivatives, in fact, behave quite like the exterior derivatives in diﬀerential geometry. We note in particular that for a ﬁxed i ( ∂ ∂θi )2 =0 . (5.23) In other words, the derivatives, in this case, are nilpotent just like the variables themselves. Furthermore, the conventional commutation relation between derivatives and coordinates now takes the form [ ∂ ∂θi ,θj ] + = ∂ ∂θi θj + θj ∂ ∂θi = ∂θj ∂θi − θj ∂ ∂θi + θj ∂ ∂θi = δij . (5.24) The notion of integration can also be generalized to Grassmann variables. Denoting by D the operation of diﬀerentiation with respect to one Grassmann variable and by I the operation of integration, we note that these must satisfy the relations ID =0 , DI =0 . (5.25) Namely, the integral of a total derivative must vanish if we ignore surface terms and furthermore, an integral, being independent of the variable, must give zero upon diﬀerentiation. Note that since dif- ferentiation with respect to a Grassmannn variable is nilpotent (see Eq. (5.23)), it satisﬁes the above properties and hence for Grassmann January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 101 5.2 Grassmann variables 91 variables integration can be naturally identiﬁed with diﬀerentiation. Namely, in this case, we have I = D. (5.26) Thus, for a function of a single Grassmann variable, we have ∫ dθf (θ)= ∂f (θ) ∂θ . (5.27) This immediately leads to the fundamental result that for Grassmann variables ∫ dθ =0 , ∫ dθθ =1 . (5.28) This is an essential diﬀerence between ordinary variables and Grass- mann variables and has far reaching consequences. An immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of the integral in Eq. (5.27) is that if we redeﬁne the variable of integration as θ′ = aθ, a ̸=0 , (5.29) then, from Eq. (5.27) we obtain ∫ dθf (θ)= ∂f (θ) ∂θ = ∂θ′ ∂θ ∂f ( θ′ a ) ∂θ′ = a ∫ dθ′ f ( θ′ a ) . (5.30) But this is precisely the inverse of what happens for ordinary vari- ables. Namely, we note that the Jacobian in the case of redeﬁnition of Grassmann variables is the inverse of what one would naively expect for ordinary (commuting) variables. This result can be generalized to integrations involving many Grassmann variables and it can be shown that if January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 102 92 5 Path integrals for fermions θ′ i = aijθj , (5.31) with det aij ̸= 0 and repeated indices being summed, then ∫ n∏ i=1 dθi f (θi)=(det aij) ∫ n∏ i=1 dθ′ if (a−1 ij θ′ j) . (5.32) We can also deﬁne a delta function in the space of Grassmann variables as δ(θ)= θ. (5.33) That this satisﬁes all the properties of the delta function can be easily seen by noting that ∫ dθδ(θ)= ∫ dθθ =1, (5.34) which follows from Eq. (5.28). In addition, if f (θ)= a + bθ , (5.35) then, ∫ dθδ(θ) f (θ)= ∫ dθθf (θ)= ∫ dθθ(a + bθ) = ∫ dθθa = ∂(θa) ∂θ = a = f (0) . (5.36) Here we have used the nilpotency of the Grassmann variables. Fur- thermore, consistent with the rule for change of variables for the Grassmann variables, if g(θ)= aθ , (5.37) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 103 5.2 Grassmann variables 93 then, we obtain δ(g(θ)) = δ(aθ)= aθ = aδ(θ)= ∂g(θ) ∂θ δ(θ) , (5.38) where g(θ) is assumed to be Grassmann odd. An integral represen- tation for the delta function can be obtained simply by noting that if ζ is also a Grassmann variable, then ∫ dζeiζθ = ∫ dζ (1 + iζθ) = ∂ ∂ζ (1 + iζθ)= iθ = iδ(θ) . (5.39) Let us next evaluate the basic Gaussian integral for Grassmann variables. Let us consider two sets of independent Grassmann vari- ables, namely, (θ1,θ2,...,θn)and (θ∗ 1,θ∗ 2,...,θ∗ n) and analyze the integral I = ∫ ∏ i,j dθ∗ i dθj e−(θ∗ i Mij θj +c∗ i θi+θ∗ i ci) , (5.40) where we are assuming that ci and c∗ i are independent Grassmann variables (sources). Furthermore, the convention for summation over repeated indices is always assumed. Note that if we make the change of variables (we are assuming that M −1 exists) θ′ i = Mijθj + ci, or,θi = M −1 ij (θ′ j − cj) , (5.41) and θ∗′ i = θ∗ i + c∗ j M −1 ji , (5.42) then, using Eqs. (5.32), (5.41) and (5.42) we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 104 94 5 Path integrals for fermions I = ∫ ∏ i,j dθ∗ i dθj e−(θ∗ i (Mij θj +ci)+c∗ i θi) =det Mij ∫ ∏ ij dθ∗ i dθ′ j e−(θ∗ i θ′ i+c∗ i M −1 ij (θ′ j −cj )) =det Mij ∫ ∏ ij dθ∗ i dθ′ j e−((θ∗ i +c∗ j M −1 ji )θ′ i−c∗ i M −1 ij cj ) =det Mij ∫ ∏ ij dθ∗′ i dθ′ j e−θ∗′ i θ′ i+c∗ i M −1 ij cj = N det Mij ec∗ i M −1 ij cj . (5.43) Here N is a constant (basically, it corresponds to a sign factor arising from the orders of the integrations of Grassmann variables) and we note that the Gaussian integral in the case of Grassmann variables has the same form as the integral for ordinary (commuting) vari- ables except for the positive power of the determinant. This leads to an essential diﬀerence between quantum mechanical bosonic and fermionic theories. 5.3 Generating functional for fermions With all this background on Grassmann variables, we can now ask whether it is possible to write a Lagrangian for the fermionic oscil- lator. Indeed, let us consider the classical Lagrangian L = i 2 ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) − ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ] , (5.44) where ψ and ¯ψ are two independent Grassmann variables which are functions of time. Quite often one eliminates a total derivative to write an equivalent Lagrangian of the form L = i ¯ψ ˙ψ − ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ]= i ¯ψ ˙ψ − ω ¯ψψ . (5.45) However, to begin with we will continue with the ﬁrst form of the Lagrangian, namely, Eq. (5.44). This Lagrangian ((5.44) or (5.45)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 105 5.3 Generating functional for fermions 95 is ﬁrst order in the time derivative and one can deﬁne canonical conjugate momenta associated with the Grassmann variables ψ and ¯ψ as usual (recall that we are using left derivatives) Πψ = ∂L ∂ ˙ψ = − i 2 ¯ψ, Π ¯ψ = ∂L ∂ ˙¯ψ = − i 2 ψ. (5.46) (Such a system is known as a constrained system and one should use the formalism of Dirac quantization to quantize such a system. We will, however, not go into these technical details which are not quite relevant to our present discussion.) With the convention of left derivatives, the proper deﬁnition of the Hamiltonian (which is only a function of coordinates and momenta and which also leads to the correct dynamical equations of motion) is H = ˙ψΠψ + ˙¯ψΠ ¯ψ − L = − i 2 ˙ψ ¯ψ − i 2 ˙¯ψψ − i 2 ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) + ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ] = i 2 ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) − i 2 ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) + ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ] = ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ] . (5.47) It is clear, therefore, that this simple Lagrangian will yield the quan- tum mechanical Hamiltonian of Eq. (5.3) for the fermionic oscillator if we identify (as quantum operators) ψ → aF , ¯ψ → a† F . (5.48) With the identiﬁcation of ψ and ¯ψ with the annihilation and the creation operators respectively, the hermiticity properties for these variables now follow. Namely, we note that (we should use com- plex conjugation for classical quantities, but complex conjugation January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 106 96 5 Path integrals for fermions for products of Grassmann variables also transposes the order which is why we use “†” for simplicity) ψ† = ¯ψ, ¯ψ† = ψ. (5.49) We note that with this convention, the number operator deﬁned as NF = a† F aF → ¯ψψ , (5.50) is Hermitian and, therefore, ¯ψψ should be real which requires N † F = NF → ( ¯ψψ)† = ψ† ¯ψ† = ¯ψψ . (5.51) Namely, since Grassmann variables have no classical analog, even when we are dealing with the reality question of products of ordi- nary Grassmann variables (not operators), we follow the above pre- scription in deﬁning complex conjugation. Namely, for any pair of Grassmann variables η and χ, we deﬁne (ηχ)∗ = χ∗η∗. (5.52) In other words, even classically, we continue to treat Grassmann vari- ables like operators. This is the only way a consistent transition from a classical to a quantum Lagrangian involving fermions is possible. With this prescription, let us note that the Lagrangian for the fermionic oscillator given in Eq. (5.44) is Hermitian (real) L† = ( i 2 ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) − ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ])† = − i 2 ( ˙ψ† ¯ψ† − ψ† ˙¯ψ†) − ω 2 [ψ†, ¯ψ†] = − i 2 ( ˙¯ψψ − ¯ψ ˙ψ) − ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ] = i 2 ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) − ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ] = L. (5.53) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 107 5.3 Generating functional for fermions 97 We can now write the vacuum functional for the fermionic oscillator in the presence of linear external sources as (ℏ =1) Z[η, ¯η]= ⟨0|0⟩η,¯η = N ∫ D ¯ψDψeiS[ψ, ¯ψ,η,¯η] , (5.54) where we have denoted the two Grassmann sources for ψ and ¯ψ by ¯η and η respectively. The complete action for the oscillator, in this case, has the form S[ψ, ¯ψ, η, ¯η]= S[ψ, ¯ψ]+ ∞∫ −∞ dt (¯ηψ + ¯ψη) , (5.55) with S[ψ, ¯ψ]= ∞∫ −∞ dtL = ∞∫ −∞ dt ( i 2 ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) − ω 2 [ ¯ψ, ψ]) . (5.56) Once again, we will assume the hermiticity conditions for the sources similar to the ones given in Eq. (5.49), namely, η† =¯η, ¯η† = η, (5.57) in order that the complete action in Eq. (5.55) is Hermitian. Just as an ordinary derivative with respect to a Grassmann variable is directional, similarly, there are right and left functional derivatives with respect to fermionic variables. The deﬁnition of the functional derivative is still the same as given in Eq. (1.14), namely, δF (ψ(t)) δψ(t′) = lim ϵ→0 F (ψ(t)+ ϵδ(t − t′)) − F (ψ(t)) ϵ . (5.58) However, since ϵ is now a Grassmann variable, the position of ϵ−1 in the expression deﬁnes the direction of the derivative. (Incidentally, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 108 98 5 Path integrals for fermions since ϵ2 =0, ϵ−1 does not really exist and one should think of ϵ−1 simply as ∂ ∂ϵ . Secondly, we note here that for polynomial functionals, the limit ϵ → 0 is redundant since ϵ2 = 0 and the highest power of ϵ in the expansion of the functional is linear.) Thus, a left functional derivative corresponds to deﬁning δF (ψ(t)) δψ(t′) = lim ϵ→0 ϵ−1 [F (ψ(t)+ ϵδ(t − t′)) − F (ψ(t))] , (5.59) whereas a right functional derivative would be deﬁned as δF (ψ(t)) δψ(t′) = lim ϵ→0 [F (ψ(t)+ ϵδ(t − t′)) − F (ψ(t))] ϵ−1. (5.60) As we have mentioned earlier, we will always work with left deriva- tives even when we are dealing with functionals involving fermionic variables. 5.4 Feynman propagator Let us next go back to the Lagrangian in Eq. (5.44) for the fermionic oscillator and note that when fermions are involved, we essentially have a matrix structure. This is another reﬂection of the fact that the Grassmann variables inherently behave like operators. Let us deﬁne the following two component matrices. Ψ= ( ψ ¯ψ ) , ¯Ψ=Ψ†σ3 = ︷ ︷ ¯ψψ ︸ ︸ σ3 = ︷ ︷ ¯ψ − ψ ︸ ︸ , Θ= ( η ¯η ) , ¯Θ=Θ†σ3 = ︷ ︷ ¯ηη ︸ ︸ σ3 = ︷ ︷ ¯η − η ︸ ︸ , (5.61) where σ3 denotes the diagonal Pauli matrix, namely, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 109 5.4 Feynman propagator 99 σ3 = ( 10 0 −1 ) . (5.62) We note, then, that ¯Ψσ3 i d dt Ψ= ︷ ︷ ¯ψ − ψ ︸ ︸ ( i d dt 0 0 −i d dt )( ψ ¯ψ ) = ︷ ︷ ¯ψ − ψ ︸ ︸ ( i ˙ψ −i ˙¯ψ ) = i ( ¯ψ ˙ψ + ψ ˙¯ψ) = i ( ¯ψ ˙ψ − ˙¯ψψ) , ¯ΨΨ = ︷ ︷ ¯ψ − ψ ︸ ︸ ( ψ ¯ψ ) = ( ¯ψψ − ψ ¯ψ) = [ ¯ψ, ψ] , ¯ΨΘ = ︷ ︷ ¯ψ − ψ ︸ ︸ ( η ¯η ) = ( ¯ψη − ψ ¯η) = ( ¯ψη +¯ηψ) = ¯ΘΨ , (5.63) where we have used the anti-commuting properties of the Grassmann variables. It is now straightforward to show that the action for the fermionic oscillator (including sources) in Eq. (5.55) can be written as S = ∞∫ −∞ dt ( i 2 ¯Ψσ3 d dt Ψ − ω 2 ¯ΨΨ + ¯ΘΨ) = ∞∫ −∞ dt ( 1 2 ¯Ψ(iσ3 d dt − ω)Ψ + ¯ΘΨ) . (5.64) We note here that, using Eq. (5.63), we could have written the source term also as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 110 100 5 Path integrals for fermions ∞∫ −∞ dt ¯ΨΘ , (5.65) so that Θ and ¯Θ are not really independent and we need to be careful in taking functional derivatives. We can write the vacuum functional as Z[Θ] = N ∫ DΨ eiS = N ∫ DΨ ei ∞∫ −∞ dt( 1 2 ¯Ψ(iσ3 d dt −ω)Ψ+ ¯ΘΨ). (5.66) This is a Gaussian integral and we know that we can evaluate the generating functional if we know the Green’s function associated with the operator in the quadratic term in the exponent (see Eq. (5.43)). Let us, therefore, study the equation (iσ3 d dt − ω) G(t − t′)= δ(t − t′) . (5.67) This is a matrix equation and it can be solved easily in the momen- tum space. Thus, we deﬁne G(t − t ′)= ∫ dk 2π G(k) e−ik(t−t′) , δ(t − t ′)= ∫ dk 2π e−ik(t−t′) , (5.68) where G(k) is a matrix in the Fourier transformed space. Substitut- ing these expressions back into Eq. (5.67), we obtain 1 2π (σ3k − ω)G(k)= 1 2π , or,G(k)= 1 σ3k − ω = σ3k + ω k2 − ω2 . (5.69) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 111 5.4 Feynman propagator 101 Consequently, the Green’s function in Eq. (5.67) has the form G(t − t′)= ∫ dk 2π G(k) e−ik(t−t′) = ∫ dk 2π σ3k + ω k2 − ω2 e−ik(t−t′) . (5.70) The singularity structure of the integrand in Eq. (5.70) is ob- vious and the Feynman prescription, in this case, will lead to the propagator (see Eq. (3.80)) GF (t − t′) = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ dk 2π σ3k + ω k2 − ω2 + iϵ e−ik(t−t′) = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ dk 2π σ3k + ω k2 − (ω − iϵ 2ω )2 e−ik(t−t′) . (5.71) This can also be written in the alternate form GF (t − t′) = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ dk 2π 1 σ3k − ω + iϵ e−ik(t−t′) , (5.72) and satisﬁes the equation (see Eq. (3.82)) lim ϵ→0+ (iσ3 d dt − ω + iϵ) GF (t − t′)= δ(t − t′) . (5.73) This deﬁnes the Feynman propagator in the present case. Going back to the vacuum functional, we note that we can write Z[Θ] = lim ϵ→0+ N ∫ DΨ ei ∫ dt( 1 2 ¯Ψ(iσ3 d dt −ω+iϵ)Ψ+ ¯ΘΨ) . (5.74) Therefore, the one point function can be obtained to be δZ[Θ] δ ¯Θ(t1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Θ= ¯Θ=0 = lim ϵ→0+ N ∫ DΨ(iΨ(t1)) e i 2 ∫ dt ¯Ψ(iσ3 d dt −ω+iϵ)Ψ =0 . (5.75) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 112 102 5 Path integrals for fermions This follows from the fact that the integrand in Eq. (5.75) is odd under (this is also related to the rules for integrations for Grassmann variables) Ψ →−Ψ, ¯Ψ →− ¯Ψ . (5.76) Similarly, we can obtain from Eq. (5.74) δZ[Θ] δΘ(t1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Θ= ¯Θ=0 =0 . (5.77) Thus, we see that if we write Z[Θ] = eiW [Θ] , (5.78) then, in this case, (−i) δ2W [Θ] δ ¯Θ(t1)δΘ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Θ= ¯Θ=0 =(−i)2 1 Z[Θ] δ2Z[Θ] δ ¯Θ(t1)δΘ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Θ= ¯Θ=0 = −⟨T (Ψ(t1) ¯Ψ(t2))⟩ . (5.79) (Compare this with Eq. (4.70) with ℏ = 1.) Incidentally, in the case of fermionic variables, time ordering is deﬁned as T (Ψ(t1) ¯Ψ(t2)) = θ(t1 − t2)Ψ(t1) ¯Ψ(t2) − θ(t2 − t1) ¯Ψ(t2)Ψ(t1). (5.80) The relative negative sign between the two terms in Eq. (5.80) arises from the change in the order of the fermionic variables, which anti- commute, in the second term. Going back to the vacuum func- tional, we note that since the exponent is quadratic in the variables (namely, it is a Gaussian integral), it can be explicitly evaluated using Eq. (5.43) to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 113 5.5 The fermion determinant 103 Z[Θ] = lim ϵ→0+ N ∫ DΨei ∫ dt( 1 2 ¯Ψ(iσ3 d dt −ω+iϵ)Ψ+ ¯ΘΨ) = Ne− i 2 ∫∫ dt1dt2 ¯Θ(t1)GF (t1−t2)Θ(t2) = Z[0] e− i 2 ∫∫ dt1dt2 ¯Θ(t1)GF (t1−t2)Θ(t2) , (5.81) where the determinant arising from the integration of the Grassmann variables has been absorbed into the deﬁnition of the normalization constant N and Z[0] represents the value of the functional in the absence of sources. It is obvious now that δ2Z[Θ] δ ¯Θ(t1)δΘ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Θ= ¯Θ=0 = iGF (t1 − t2) Z[0] . (5.82) Therefore, using Eq. (5.79) we have ⟨T (Ψ(t1) ¯Ψ(t2))⟩ = −(−i)2 1 Z[Θ] δ2Z[Θ] δ ¯Θ(t1)δΘ(t2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Θ= ¯Θ=0 = −(−i)2 1 Z[0] iGF (t1 − t2)Z[0] = iGF (t1 − t2) . (5.83) This again shows (see Eq. (4.76)) that the time ordered two-point correlation function for the fermions in the vacuum gives the Feyn- man Green’s function. As we have argued earlier, this is a general feature of all quantum theories. 5.5 The fermion determinant The fermion action following from Eq. (5.44) or Eq. (5.45) is quadratic in the dynamical variables just like the action of the bosonic oscillator in Eq. (3.2). Therefore, the generating functional can be easily eval- uated. In this section, we will evaluate the generating functional for the fermions in the absence of any source (which gives the determi- nant absorbed into the normalization constant N in Eq. (5.81)). For simplicity, let us take the dynamical Lagrangian of Eq. (5.45). Then, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 114 104 5 Path integrals for fermions we can write the generating functional, in the absence of sources, to be Z[0] = ˜N ∫ D ¯ψDψeiS[ψ, ¯ψ] = ˜N ∫ D ¯ψDψei tf∫ ti dt (i ¯ψ ˙ψ−ω ¯ψψ). (5.84) Here we have used the anti-commuting properties of the Grassmann variables to rewrite the commutator of the fermionic variables in a simpler form. The constant ˜N (we use ˜N instead of N to avoid any possible confusion with the number of discrete time intervals to be introduced below), representing the normalization of the path integral measure is arbitrary at this point and would be appropriately chosen later. We can once again deﬁne tf − ti = T, (5.85) as the time interval and translate the time coordinate to write the generating functional of Eq. (5.84) also as Z[0] = ˜N ∫ D ¯ψDψei T∫ 0 dt (i ¯ψ ˙ψ−ω ¯ψψ) . (5.86) To evaluate the path integral, we should discretize the time interval as in Eq. (2.19). Thus, deﬁning the intermediate time points to be tn = nϵ, n =1, 2,...,N − 1 , (5.87) where the inﬁnitesimal interval is deﬁned to be ϵ = T N , (5.88) we can write the path integral to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 115 5.5 The fermion determinant 105 Z[0] = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ˜N ∫ d ¯ψ1 ··· d ¯ψN −1dψ1 ··· dψN −1 × eiϵ N∑ n=1(i ¯ψn( ψn−ψn−1 ϵ )−ω ¯ψn( ψn+ψn−1 2 )) . (5.89) Here we have used the mid-point prescription of Weyl ordering as discussed in Eqs. (2.18) and (2.22) along with the earlier observation that the variable ¯ψ represents the momentum conjugate to ψ. The exponent in Eq. (5.89) can be written out in detail as − [N −1∑ n=1 (1 + iϵω 2 ) ¯ψnψn + (1+ iϵω 2 ) ¯ψN ψN − N −1∑ n=2 (1 − iϵω 2 ) ¯ψnψn−1 − (1 − iϵω 2 ) ¯ψ1ψ0 − (1 − iϵω 2 ) ¯ψN ψN −1 ] . (5.90) Thus, deﬁning (N − 1) component matrices ψ = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ψ1 ψ2 ... ψN −1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , ¯ψ = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ¯ψ1 ¯ψ2 ... ¯ψN −1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , J = − (1 − iϵω 2 ) ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ψ0 0 ... 0 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , ¯J = − (1 − iϵω 2 ) ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ 0 ... 0 ¯ψN ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , (5.91) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 116 106 5 Path integrals for fermions we can write the path integral of Eq. (5.89) also as Z[0] = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ˜N ∫ d ¯ψdψe−( ¯ψT Bψ+ ¯J T ψ+ ¯ψT J+(1+ iϵω 2 ) ¯ψN ψN ) , (5.92) wherewehavedeﬁneda(N − 1) × (N − 1) matrix B as B = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ x 00 0 ··· yx 00 ··· 0 yx 0 ··· ... ... ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , (5.93) with x = (1+ iϵω 2 ) , y = − (1 − iϵω 2 ) . (5.94) The path integral in Eq. (5.92) can now be easily evaluated using Eq. (5.43) and the result is Z[0] = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ˜N det Be( ¯J T B−1J−(1+ iϵω 2 ) ¯ψN ψN ) = lim ϵ→0 N →∞ ˜N det Be( ¯JN −1B−1 N −1,1J1−(1+ iϵω 2 ) ¯ψN ψN ), (5.95) where any sign factor coming from the integration over the Grass- mann variablesisincludedin ˜N .The matrix B has a very simple January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 117 5.6 References 107 structure and we can easily evaluate the determinant as well as the appropriate element of the inverse matrix which have the following forms det B = xN −1 = (1+ iϵω 2 )N −1 , B−1 N −1,1 =(−1)N yN −2 xN −1 = (1 − iϵω 2 )N −2 (1+ iϵω 2 )N −1 . (5.96) In the continuum limit of ϵ → 0and N →∞ such that Nϵ = T ,the path integral, therefore, has the form Z[0] = ˜Ne iωT 2 e(e−iωT ¯ψN ψ0− ¯ψN ψN ) = ˜Ne iωT 2 e(e−iωT ¯ψf ψi− ¯ψf ψf ) . (5.97) Here we have identiﬁed ψ0 = ψi,ψN = ψf , ¯ψ0 = ¯ψi, ¯ψN = ¯ψf . (5.98) We choose, for simplicity and for future use, the normalization of the path integral measure to be ˜N = 1 so that the free fermion path integral takes the form Z[0] = e iωT 2 e(e−iωT ¯ψf ψi− ¯ψf ψf ) .

(6.2) Here we are assuming that ℏ = 1 (see Eqs. (5.2) and (5.3)). The cre- ation and the annihilation operators for the bosonic oscillator satisfy the commutation relations [aB,a† B] =1 , (6.3) with all others vanishing. For the fermionic oscillator, on the other hand, the creation and the annihilation operators satisfy the anti- commutation relations (see Eq. (5.6)) [aF ,aF ]+ =0= [a† F ,a† F ] + , [aF ,a† F ] + =1 . (6.4) 109 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 120 110 6 Supersymmetry Let us note here (as we have pointed out earlier in Chapter 5) that the ground state energy for the bosonic oscillator is ω 2 whereas that for the fermionic oscillator is − ω 2 . Let us next consider a system consisting of a bosonic and a fermionic oscillator with the same natural frequency ω. Thisisknown as the supersymmetric oscillator and provides the simplest example of a class of theories known as supersymmetric theories. The Hamil- tonian for this system follows from Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2) to be H = HB + HF = ω 2 (a† BaB + aBa† B + a† F aF − aF a† F ) = ω (a† BaB + 1 2 + a† F aF − 1 2 ) = ω (a† BaB + a† F aF ) . (6.5) We note from Eq. (6.5) that the constant term in the Hamiltonian for this system has cancelled out suggesting a vanishing zero point energy for this system. If we deﬁne the number operators for the bosonic and the fermionic oscillators as NB = a† BaB , NF = a† F aF , (6.6) then, we can write the Hamiltonian for the system also as H = ω(NB + NF ) , (6.7) where NB and NF commute (since the bosonic creation and annihi- lation operators commute with those for the fermionic system). It is clear from Eq. (6.7) that the energy eigenstates of the system will be a product of the eigenstates of the number operators NB and NF . Consequently, let us deﬁne |nB,nF ⟩ = |nB⟩⊗|nF ⟩ , (6.8) where January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 121 6.1 Supersymmetric oscillator 111 NB|nB⟩ = nB|nB⟩,nB =0, 1, 2,... , NF |nF ⟩ = nF |nF ⟩,nF =0, 1 . (6.9) Here we are using our earlier result in Eq. (5.12) that the eigenvalues for the fermion number operator are 0 or 1 consistent with the Pauli principle while the eigenvalues for the bosonic number operator can take any positive semideﬁnite integer value. From Eqs. (6.7), (6.8) and (6.9) we note that the energy eigenvalues for the supersymmetric oscillator are given by H|nB,nF ⟩ = EnB,nF |nB,nF ⟩ = ω(nB + nF )|nB,nF ⟩ , (6.10) with nB =0, 1, 2 ... and nF =0, 1. We note explicitly from Eq. (6.10) that the ground state energy of the supersymmetric oscillator vanishes, namely, E0,0 =0 , (6.11) and the ground state (vacuum) of the theory is assumed to satisfy aB|0, 0⟩ =0= aF |0, 0⟩ . (6.12) The vanishing of the ground state energy is a general feature of su- persymmetric theories and as we will see shortly it is a consequence of the fact that such theories are invariant under symmetry trans- formations (known as supersymmetry transformations) which trans- form bosonic variables into fermionic ones and vice versa.We also observe from Eq. (6.10) that except for the ground state, all other energy eigenstates of the system are doubly degenerate. Namely, the states |nB, 1⟩ and |nB +1, 0⟩ have the same energy for any value of nB. The degeneracy in the energy value for a bosonic (nF =0) and a fermionic (nF = 1) state, as we will see, is again a consequence of the supersymmetry of the system. Let us next consider the following two fermionic operators in the theory January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 122 112 6 Supersymmetry Q = a† BaF , ¯Q = a† F aB, ¯Q = Q†. (6.13) We can show using the commutation relations in Eqs. (6.3) and (6.4) that (the bosonic operators commute with the fermionic ones) [Q, H]= [a† BaF ,ω(a† BaB + a† F aF )] = ω (a† B [a† B,aB] aF + a† B [aF ,a† F ] + aF ) = ω (−a† BaF + a† BaF ) =0 , (6.14) and similarly, [ ¯Q, H]= [a† F aB,ω(a† BaB + a† F aF )] =0 . (6.15) The two operators, Q and ¯Q, deﬁne conserved quantities (charges) of the system and would correspond to generators of inﬁnitesimal sym- metry transformations in the theory. However, since the generators are fermionic in nature, the symmetries which they would generate will correspond to fermionic symmetries. In fact, using the (anti) commutation relations, it can be checked that these charges rotate the bosonic operators into fermionic ones and vice versa.We also note that [Q, ¯Q]+ = [a† BaF ,a† F aB] + = a† B [aF ,a† F ] + aB − a† F [a† B,aB] aF = a† BaB + a† F aF = 1 ω H. (6.16) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 123 6.1 Supersymmetric oscillator 113 Thus, we see from Eqs. (6.14), (6.15) and (6.16) that the opera- tors Q, ¯Q and H deﬁne a closed algebra which involves both commu- tators and anti-commutators. Such an algebra is known as a graded Lie algebra and deﬁnes the inﬁnitesimal form of the supersymmetry transformations. An immediate consequence of the supersymmetry algebra is that if the ground state of the theory is invariant under supersymmetry transformations, namely, if (see Eq. (6.12), for sim- plicity, we identify |0⟩≡|0, 0⟩) Q|0⟩ =0= ¯Q|0⟩ , (6.17) then it follows from Eq. (6.16) that ⟨0|H|0⟩ = ω ⟨0|Q ¯Q + ¯QQ|0⟩ =0 . (6.18) Namely, the ground state energy in a supersymmetric theory vanishes as a consequence of the supersymmetry algebra. Furthermore, we note from Eq. (6.13) that ¯Q is really the Hermitian conjugate of Q. Consequently, it follows from Eq. (6.16) that in a supersymmetric theory H is really a positive semideﬁnite operator and, therefore, its expectation value in any state must be positive semideﬁnite. Let us next analyze the eﬀect of Q and ¯Q on the energy eigen- states of the system. We note from the commutation rules of the theory that [Q, NB]= [a† BaF ,a† BaB] = a† B [a† B,aB] aF = −a† BaF = −Q, [Q, NF ]= [a† BaF ,a† F aF ] = a† B [aF ,a† F ] + aF = a† BaF = Q, (6.19) and similarly January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 124 114 6 Supersymmetry [ ¯Q, NB]= ¯Q, [ ¯Q, NF ]= − ¯Q. (6.20) In other words, we can think of Q as raising the bosonic number nB while lowering the fermionic number nF by one unit whereas ¯Q does the opposite. It now follows that for |nB,nF ⟩ = (a† B)nB √nB! (a† F )nF |0⟩ , (6.21) wherewerecognize nF =0, 1and nB =0, 1, 2,... ,wehave Q|nB,nF ⟩ = { 0if nF =0 , √nB +1|nB +1, 0⟩ if nF =1 , ¯Q|nB,nF ⟩ = { √nB|nB − 1, 1⟩ if nF =0 , 0if nF =1 . (6.22) Namely, we note that acting on any state other than the ground state, the operators Q and ¯Q take a bosonic state (with nF =0) to a fermionic state (with nF =1)and vice versa. This is the mani- festation of supersymmetry on the states in the Hilbert space of the Hamiltonian, i.e., the bosonic and the fermionic states are paired. Furthermore, since Q and ¯Q commute with the Hamiltonian of the system (see Eqs (6.14) and (6.15)), it now follows that such paired states (namely, |nB,nF ⟩ and Q|nB,nF ⟩ or |nB,nF ⟩ and ¯Q|nB,nF ⟩) will be degenerate in energy except for the ground state. Namely H(Q|nB,nF ⟩)= Q(H|nB,nF ⟩)= EnB,nF (Q|nB,nF ⟩) , H( ¯Q|nB,nF ⟩)= ¯Q(H|nB,nF ⟩)= EnB,nF ( ¯Q|nB ,nF ⟩) . (6.23) The supersymmetric oscillator is the simplest example of su- persymmetric theories. The concept of supersymmetry and graded Lie algebras generalizes to other cases as well and there exist many useful realizations of these algebras in the context of ﬁeld theories. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 125 6.2 Supersymmetric quantum mechanics 115 6.2 Supersymmetric quantum mechanics Let us next study a general supersymmetric, quantum mechanical theory in one dimension. From our discussion in the last section, we note that supersymmetry necessarily involves both bosons and fermions and, therefore, let us consider a general classical Lagrangian of the form L = 1 2 ˙x2 − 1 2 (W (x))2 + i ¯ψ ˙ψ − 1 2 W ′(x)[ ¯ψ, ψ] . (6.24) Here, for consistency with earlier discussions we have set m =1 for the bosonic part of the Lagrangian. We also note here that W (x)can be any chosen monomial of x at this point. It is clear from Eq. (6.24) that when W (x)= ωx , (6.25) the Lagrangian of Eq. (6.24) reduces to that of a supersymmetric oscillator discussed in the last section. In general, we note that under the inﬁnitesimal transformations δϵx = 1 √2 ¯ψϵ, δϵψ = − i √2 ˙xϵ − 1 √2 W (x)ϵ, δϵ ¯ψ =0 , (6.26) and δ¯ϵx = 1 √2 ¯ϵψ , δ¯ϵψ =0 , δ¯ϵ ¯ψ = i √2 ˙x¯ϵ − 1 √2 W (x)¯ϵ, (6.27) where ϵ and ¯ϵ are constant inﬁnitesimal Grassmann parameters, the action for the Lagrangian remains unchanged. (Note that since January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 126 116 6 Supersymmetry ϵ2 =0= ¯ϵ2, the qualiﬁcation inﬁnitesimal is redundant.) In other words, the transformations in Eqs. (6.26) and (6.27) deﬁne global symmetries of the system. (See Chapter 11 for a detailed discussion of symmetries.) These symmetry transformations (Eqs. (6.26) and (6.27)) mix up the bosonic and the fermionic variables of the theory and, therefore, are reminiscent of the supersymmetry transforma- tions which we discussed earlier. In fact, one can explicitly show that the two sets of transformations in Eqs. (6.26) and (6.27) are generated respectively by the two supersymmetric charges Q and ¯Q in the theory (which can be constructed through the Noether pro- cedure discussed in Chapter 11.) For completeness we simply note here that in the operator language, the two supersymmetric charges canbewrittenas(comparewithEq. (6.13)) Q = A †ψ = 1 √2 (p + iW (x)) ψ, ¯Q = A ¯ψ = 1 √2 (p − iW (x)) ¯ψ, (6.28) which, of course, reduce to Eq. (6.13) when W (x)= ωx (up to a normalization, with ψ = aF , ¯ψ = a† F ). Note also that a realization for the fermionic anti-commutation relations in Eq. (6.4) (with ψ = aF , ¯ψ = a† F ) is provided by the matrices (with σ± =(σ1 ± iσ2)/2) ψ = σ+, ¯ψ = σ−,σ+ = (01 00 ) ,σ− = (00 10 ) . (6.29) In this case, the supersymmetric Hamiltonian can be written as H = [Q, ¯Q] + = 1 2 (p2 +(W (x))2 − W ′(x)σ3) , (6.30) and we can identify the two diagonal elements as the supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 127 6.2 Supersymmetric quantum mechanics 117 H− = 1 2 (p2 +(W (x))2 − W ′(x)) = A†A, H+ = 1 2 (p2 +(W (x))2 + W ′(x)) = AA †, (6.31) where W ′(x) denotes the derivative of the superpotential W (x)with respect to x. We note here, without going into detail, that while the La- grangian in Eq. (6.24) is supersymmetric for any monomial W (x), in the case of even monomials the presence of instantons breaks super- symmetry. (Instantons are discussed in Chapter 8.) Consequently, let us consider monomials only of the form. W (x) ∼ x2n+1,n =0, 1, 2,... . (6.32) With these preparations, let us next look at the generating functional for the supersymmetric quantum mechanical theory in Eq. (6.24) (recall that ℏ =1) Z = N ∫ D ¯ψDψDxeiS[x,ψ, ¯ψ] . (6.33) As we have seen in the last section, the spectrum of a supersym- metric theory has many interesting features. Correspondingly, the generating functional for such a theory is also quite interesting. In particular, let us note from Eq. (6.24) that since the Lagrangian is quadratic in the fermionic variables, the functional integral for these variables can be done easily using our results in Chapter 5. (See Eqs. (5.43) and (5.95).) Thus, we can write the fermion part of the path integral as ∫ D ¯ψDψei ∫ dt( ¯ψ(i d dt −W ′(x))ψ) = N ′ det (i d dt − W ′(x)) . (6.34) Substituting Eq. (6.34) into Eq. (6.33), we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 128 118 6 Supersymmetry Z = N ∫ D ¯ψDψDxeiS[x,ψ, ¯ψ] = N ∫ Dxei ∫ dt( 1 2 ˙x2− 1 2 (W (x))2)∫ D ¯ψDψei ∫ dt( ¯ψ(i d dt −W ′(x))ψ) = ˜N ∫ Dx det (i d dt − W ′(x)) ei ∫ dt( 1 2 ˙x2− 1 2 (W (x))2) . (6.35) Let us next note that if we deﬁne a new bosonic variable through the relation ρ = i ˙x − W (x) , (6.36) then the Jacobian for this change of variables in Eq. (6.36) will be given by J = [det (i d dt − W ′(x))]−1 . (6.37) This is precisely the inverse of the determinant in Eq. (6.35). Furthermore, we note that ∫ dtρ 2 = ∫ dt (i ˙x − W (x))2 = ∫ dt (− ˙x2 − 2i ˙xW (x)+(W (x))2) = − ∫ dt ( ˙x2 − (W (x))2) − 2i ∞∫ −∞ dxW (x) = − ∫ dt ( ˙x2 − (W (x))2) . (6.38) Here we have used the fact that for W (x) of the form in Eq. (6.32), the last integral vanishes. (For even monomials, on the other hand, this does not vanish giving the contribution due to the instantons which breaks supersymmetry.) Substituting Eqs. (6.36), (6.37) and (6.38) into the generating functional in Eq. (6.35), we ﬁnd January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 129 6.3 Shape invariance 119 Z = ˜N ∫ Dρe− i 2 ∫ dtρ2 . (6.39) In other words, we see that the generating functional for a super- symmetric theory can be redeﬁned to have the form of a free bosonic generating functional. This is known as the Nicolai map (namely, Eq. (6.36)) and generalizes to ﬁeld theories in higher dimensions as well. 6.3 Shape invariance As we have noted earlier, there are only a handful of quantum me- chanical systems which can be solved analytically. The solubility of such systems now appears to be related to a special symmetry associ- ated with these systems known as shape invariance. This symmetry is also quite useful in the evaluation of the path integrals for such systems. Let us consider a one dimensional quantum mechanical system described by the Hamiltonian (we assume ℏ = m =1) H− = p2 2 + V−(x) . (6.40) If we assume the ground state of the system to have vanishing energy, then we can write the Hamiltonian in Eq. (6.40) also in the factorized form H− = A †A, (6.41) where (these have the same forms as the operators A, A† in Eq. (6.28)) A = 1 √2 (p − iW (x)) , A† = 1 √2 (p + iW (x)) , (6.42) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 130 120 6 Supersymmetry and we identify (W (x) is the superpotential) V−(x)= 1 2 (W 2(x) − W ′(x)) . (6.43) Such a relation is known as a Riccati relation. The ground state of the theory is assumed to satisfy (since the ground state energy vanishes) A|ψ0⟩ =0. (6.44) We note that A and A† are Hermitian conjugates of each other and that given these two operators, we can construct a second Her- mitian Hamiltonian of the form H+ = AA † = p2 2 + V+(x)= p2 2 + 1 2 (W 2(x)+ W ′(x)) . (6.45) It now follows that if |ψ⟩ is any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H− other than the ground state, namely, if H−|ψ⟩ = A†A|ψ⟩ = λ|ψ⟩,λ ̸=0 , (6.46) then AH−|ψ⟩ = λ(A|ψ⟩), or,AA †(A|ψ⟩)= λ(A|ψ⟩), or,H+(A|ψ⟩)= λ(A|ψ⟩) . (6.47) Namely, we note that the two Hamiltonians, H− and H+,are almost isospectral in the sense that they share the same energy spectrum except for the ground state energy of H−. (These are the supersym- metric partner Hamiltonians we constructed in Eq. (6.31).) The potential, of course, depends on some parameters such as the coupling constants. However, if the potential of the theory is such that we can write V+(x, a0)= V−(x, a1)+ R(a1) , (6.48) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 131 6.3 Shape invariance 121 with R(a1) a constant and the parameters a0 and a1 satisfying a known functional relationship a1 = f (a0) , (6.49) then we say that the potential is shape invariant. (Namely, the po- tential for the partner Hamiltonian has the same form or shape as the original Hamiltonian with modiﬁed parameters and a possible shift.) In such a case, we can write using Eq. (6.48) H−(a0)= A†(a0)A(a0)= p2 2 + V−(x, a0) , H+(a0)= A(a0)A †(a0)= p2 2 + V+(x, a0) = p2 2 + V−(x, a1)+ R(a1) = H−(a1)+ R(a1) = A†(a1)A(a1)+ R(a1) . (6.50) Since the ground state energy of H− vanishes and since we know that H+(a0)and H−(a0) are almost isospectral, it follows now from Eq. (6.50) that the energy value for the ﬁrst excited state of H−(a0) must be E1 = R(a1) . (6.51) It is also easy to see now that for a shape invariant potential, we can construct a sequence of Hamiltonians such as H (0) = H−(a0) , H (1) = H+(a0)= H−(a1)+ R(a1) , H (2) = H+(a1)+ R(a1)= H−(a2)+ R(a1)+ R(a2) , ...= ... January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 132 122 6 Supersymmetry H (s) = H+(as−1)+ s−1∑ k=1 R(ak) = H−(as)+ s∑ k=1 R(ak) . (6.52) Here we have identiﬁed as = f s(a0)= f (f ... (f (a0)) ... ) . (6.53) Any two consecutive Hamiltonians in Eq. (6.52) will be almost isospec- tral and from this, with a little bit of analysis, we can determine the energy levels of H−(a0)tobe En = n∑ k=1 R(ak) . (6.54) We emphasize here that supersymmetry allows us to construct only a pair of partner Hamiltonians which are almost isospectral, but does not determine the energy levels. However, combined with shape in- variance, supersymmetry leads to a sequence of Hamiltonians where any consecutive pair is almost isospectral and, in the process, deter- mines the energy levels. Given the sequence of Hamiltonians in Eq. (6.52) we can write down the relation A(as)A†(as)= A†(as+1)A(as+1)+ R(as+1) or,A(as)H (s) = H (s+1)A(as) . (6.55) This deﬁnes a recursion relation between the sequence of Hamiltoni- ans. Furthermore, for t> 0, deﬁning the time evolution operator for a particular Hamiltonian H (s) in the sequence to be U (s) = e−itH (s) , (6.56) we note that Eq. (6.55) gives January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 133 6.3 Shape invariance 123 A(as)U (s) = A(as)e−itH (s) = e−itH (s+1)A(as)= U (s+1)A(as) . (6.57) Similarly, by taking the time derivative of Eq. (6.56), we obtain ∂U (s) ∂t = −iH (s)e−itH (s) = −i ( A†(as)A(as)+ s∑ k=1 R(ak) ) e−itH (s) = −i s∑ k=1 R(ak)U (s) − iA †(as)U (s+1)A(as), or, ( ∂ ∂t + i s∑ k=1 R(ak) ) U (s) = −iA†(as)U (s+1)A(as) . (6.58) The relations in Eqs. (6.57) and (6.58) deﬁne recursion relations for the time evolution operator and have the coordinate representa- tion of the form ( ∂ ∂x + W (x, as)) U (s)(x, y; t) = − ( ∂ ∂y − W (y, as)) U (s+1)(x, y; t) , ( ∂ ∂t + i s∑ k=1 R(ak) ) U (s)(x, y; t) = − i 2 ( ∂ ∂x − W (x, as))( ∂ ∂y − W (y, as)) U (s+1)(x, y; t) . (6.59) It is clear from this discussion that, for a shape invariant po- tential, if one of the Hamiltonians in the sequence coincides with a system which we can solve exactly, then the energy levels of the January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 134 124 6 Supersymmetry original system can be determined. Furthermore, using the recursion relations in Eq. (6.59), we can solve for the time evolution operator of the original system. This will determine the path integral for the system. 6.4 Example Let us consider a quantum mechanical system with W (x, a0)= a0 tanh x, a0 =1 . (6.60) From Eqs. (6.43) and (6.45), we ﬁnd V−(x, a0)= 1 2 (W 2(x, a0) − W ′(x, a0)) = 1 2 (a2 0 tanh2 x − a0 sech2x) = 1 2 (a2 0 − a0(a0 + 1) sech2x) = 1 2 − sech2x, V+(x, a0)= 1 2 (W 2(x, a0)+ W ′(x, a0)) = 1 2 (a2 0 tanh2 x + a0 sech2x) = 1 2 (a2 0 − a0(a0 − 1) sech2x) = 1 2 = 1 2 (a2 1 − a1(a1 + 1) sech2x) + R(a1) . (6.61) In this case, therefore, we can identify a0 =1,a1 = a0 − 1=0,R(a1)= 2a1 +1 2 = 1 2 . (6.62) We see that the original Hamiltonian for the system, in this case, is January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 135 6.5 Supersymmetry and singular potentials 125 H (0) = H−(a0)= p2 2 − sech2x + 1 2 , (6.63) and the next Hamiltonian in the sequence is given by (see Eq. (6.52)) H (1) = H+(a0)= H−(a1)+ R(a1)= p2 2 + 1 2 . (6.64) This is, of course, the free particle Hamiltonian for which we know the transition amplitude to be (see Eq. (2.49)) U (1)(x, y; t)= 1 √2πit ei( (x−y)2 2t − t 2 ) . (6.65) Substituting Eq. (6.65) into Eq. (6.59), it is easy to see that U (0)(x, y; t)= 1 2 sechx sechy − 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ dk (ik − tanh x)(ik + tanh y) 1+ k2 e(ik(x−y)− it 2 (k2+1)) . This determines the transition amplitude for the original system. We comment here that the sech2x potentials (soliton potentials) are known to be reﬂectionless. The connection of this Hamiltonian with the free Hamiltonian, through shape invariance, gives an in- tuitive reason for this. Furthermore, this derivation also works for n-soliton potentials where a0 = n, a positive integer. In this case, the parameter is reduced by 1 at every order, ultimately vanishing to give the free particle Hamiltonian. 6.5 Supersymmetry and singular potentials Singular potentials within the context of quantum mechanics are interesting because they remind us of the necessity of regularization even in such simple systems. We know from studies in relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories that a regularization must always be chosen consistent with the symmetries of the theory under study in order to January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 136 126 6 Supersymmetry be able to extract meaningful results. An improper choice of regular- ization can lead to incorrect conclusions about the theory. In simple quantum mechanical systems, a careful analysis of singular systems using a regularization have led to the working rule that the quantum mechanical wave function must vanish at points where the poten- tial becomes inﬁnite. It must be emphasized that such a condition should not be thought of as a boundary condition, rather it is a con- sistency condition which arises from treating the singular potential in a carefully regularized manner. In going beyond simple quantum mechanical systems, however, such a working rule (boundary condition) should not be blindly im- posed which can lead to erroneous conclusions. Singular potentials within the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems provide an excellent example of this and we will discuss this in this section. This will also bring out clearly how choosing a regularization consistent with the symmetries of the system under study is impor- tant. We will study a simple model, the super-symmetric “half” oscillator, to bring out these features. Other quantum mechanical systems with a complex singularity structure can be found in the literature. To understand the supersymmetric “half” oscillator or the su- persymmetric oscillator on the half line, it is useful to recapitulate brieﬂy the results of the “half” oscillator. Let us consider a particle moving in the potential (the zero point energy has been subtracted) V (x)= { 1 2 (ω2x2 − ω), for x> 0 , ∞, for x< 0 . (6.66) The spectrum of this potential is quite clear intuitively. Namely, because of the inﬁnite barrier, we expect the wave function to vanish at the origin leading to the conclusion that, of all the solutions of the oscillator on the full line, only the odd solutions (of course, on the “half” line there is no notion of even and odd) would survive in this case. While this is quite obvious, let us analyze the problem systematically for later purpose. First, let us note that singular potentials are best studied in a regularized manner because this is the only way that appropriate boundary conditions can be determined correctly. Therefore, let us consider the particle moving in the regularized potential January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 137 6.5 Supersymmetry and singular potentials 127 V (x)= { 1 2 (ω2x2 − ω), for x> 0 c2 2 , for x< 0 , (6.67) with the understanding that the limit |c|→∞ is to be taken only at theend. TheSchr¨odinger equation (ℏ = m =1) (− 1 2 d2 dx2 + V (x)) ψ(x)= ϵψ(x) , (6.68) can now be solved in the two regions. Since |c|→∞ at the end, for any ﬁnite energy solution, we have the asymptotically damped solution, for x< 0, (A is a constant) ψ(II)(x)= Ae(c2−2ϵ) 1 2 x . (6.69) Since the system no longer has reﬂection symmetry, the solu- tions, in the region x> 0, cannot be classiﬁed into even and odd solutions. Rather, the normalizable (physical) solution would cor- respond to one which vanishes asymptotically. The solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation (Eq. (6.68)), in the region x> 0, are given by the parabolic cylinder functions and the asymptotically damped physical solution is given by (B is a constant) ψ(I)(x)= BU (− ( ϵ ω + 1 2 ) , √2ωx) . (6.70) The parabolic cylinder function, U (a, x) vanishes for large values of x. For small values of x, it satisﬁes U (a, x) x→0 → √π 2 1 4 (2a+1)Γ( 3 4 + a 2 ) , U ′(a, x) x→0 →− √π 2 1 4 (2a−1)Γ( 1 4 + a 2 ) . (6.71) It is now straightforward to match the solutions in Eqs. (6.69), (6.70) and their ﬁrst derivatives across the boundary at x =0andtheir ratio gives January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 138 128 6 Supersymmetry 1 √c2 − 2ϵ = − 1 2√ω Γ(− ϵ 2ω ) Γ(− ϵ 2ω + 1 2 ) . (6.72) It is clear, then, that as |c|→∞, this can be satisﬁed only if − ϵ 2ω + 1 2 |c|→∞ −→ −n, n =0, 1, 2,... . (6.73) In other words, when the regularization is removed, the energy levels that survive are the odd ones, namely, (remember that the zero point energy is already subtracted out in (6.66) or (6.67)) ϵn = ω(2n +1) . (6.74) The corresponding physical wave functions are nontrivial only on the half line x> 0 and have the form ψn(x)= Bn U ( −( 2n + 3 2 ), √2ωx ) = ˜Bn e− 1 2 ωx2 H2n+1(√ωx) . (6.75) Namely, only the odd Hermite polynomials survive leading to the fact that the wave function vanishes at x = 0. Thus, we see that the correct boundary condition naturally arises from regularizing the singular potential and studying the problem systematically. We now turn to the analysis of the supersymmetric oscillator on the half line. One can deﬁne a superpotential W (x)= { ωx, for x> 0 , ∞, for x< 0 , (6.76) which would, naively, lead to the pair of potentials V∓(x)= 1 2 (W 2(x) ∓ W ′(x)) = { 1 2 (ω2x2 ∓ ω), for x> 0 , ∞, for x< 0 . (6.77) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 139 6.5 Supersymmetry and singular potentials 129 Since, this involves singular potentials, we can study it, as before, by regularizing the singular potentials as V−(x)= { 1 2 (ω2x2 − ω), for x> 0 , c2 − 2 , for x< 0 , V+(x)= { 1 2 (ω2x2 + ω), for x> 0 , c2 + 2 , for x< 0 , (6.78) with the understanding that |c±|→∞ at the end. The earlier analysis can now be repeated for the pair of po- tentials in Eq. (6.78). It is straightforward and without going into details, let us simply note the results in this case ϵ−,n = ω(2n +1),ψ−,n(x)= B−,n e− 1 2 ωx2 H2n+1(√ωx) , ϵ+,n =2ω(n +1),ψ+,n(x)= B+,n e− 1 2 ωx2 H2n+1(√ωx) . (6.79) Here n =0, 1, 2,... . There are several things to note from this anal- ysis. First, only the odd Hermite polynomials survive as physical solutions since the wave function has to vanish at the origin. This boundary condition arises from a systematic study involving a regu- larized potential. Second, the energy levels for the supersymmetric pair of Hamiltonians are no longer degenerate (one is odd, the other even). Furthermore, the state with ϵ = 0 no longer belongs to the Hilbert space (since it corresponds to an even Hermite polynomial solution). This leads to the conventional conclusion that supersym- metry is broken in such a case and let us note, in particular, that in such a case, it would appear that the superpartner states do not belong to the physical Hilbert space (Namely, in this case, the super- charge is an odd operator and hence connects even and odd Hermite polynomials. However, the boundary condition selects out only odd Hermite polynomials as belonging to the physical Hilbert space.). There is absolutely no doubt that the results of the calculation show that supersymmetry is broken in this case. The question that needs to be addressed is whether it is a dynamical property of the system or an artifact of the regularization (and, hence the boundary January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 140 130 6 Supersymmetry condition) used. The answer is quite obvious, namely, that supersym- metry is broken mainly because the regularization (and, therefore, the boundary condition) breaks supersymmetry. In other words, for any value of the regularizing parameters, c± (even if |c+| = |c−|), the pair of potentials in Eq. (6.78) do not deﬁne a supersymmet- ric system and hence the regularization itself breaks supersymmetry. Consequently, the breaking of supersymmetry that results when the regularization is removed cannot be trusted as a dynamical eﬀect. 6.5.1 Regularized superpotential The proper way to understand the problem is to note that for a supersymmetric system, it is not the potential that is fundamental. Rather, it is the superpotential which gives the pair of supersymmet- ric potentials through Riccati type relations. It is natural, therefore, to regularize the superpotential which would automatically lead to a pair of regularized potentials which would be supersymmetric for any value of the regularization parameter. Namely, such a regular- ization will respect supersymmetry and, with such a regularization, it is, then, meaningful to ask if supersymmetry is broken when the regularization parameter is removed at the end. With this in mind, let us look at the regularized superpotential W (x)= ωxθ(x) − cθ(−x) . (6.80) Here c is the regularization parameter and we are supposed to take |c|→∞ at the end. Note that the existence of a normalizable ground state for H− selects out c> 0 (otherwise, the regularization would have broken supersymmetry through instanton eﬀects as we have mentioned earlier). The regularized superpotential now leads to the pair of regular- ized supersymmetric potentials V−(x)= 1 2 [(ω2x2 − ω)θ(x)+ c2θ(−x) − cδ(x)] , V+(x)= 1 2 [(ω2x2 + ω)θ(x)+ c2θ(−x)+ cδ(x)] , (6.81) which are supersymmetric for any c> 0. Let us note that the dif- ference here from the earlier case where the potentials were directly January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 141 6.5 Supersymmetry and singular potentials 131 regularized (see Eq. (6.78)) lies only in the presence of the δ(x)terms in the potentials. Consequently, the earlier solutions in the regions x> 0and x< 0 continue to hold. However, the matching condi- tions are now diﬀerent because of the delta function terms. Carefully matching the wave function and the discontinuity of the ﬁrst deriva- tive across x = 0 for each of the wavefunctions and taking their ratio, we obtain the two conditions 1 (c2 − 2ϵ−)1/2 − c = − 1 2√ω Γ(− ϵ− 2ω ) Γ(− ϵ− 2ω + 1 2 ) , (6.82) 1 (c2 − 2ϵ+)1/2 + c = − 1 2√ω Γ(− ϵ+ 2ω + 1 2 ) Γ(− ϵ+ 2ω +1) . (6.83) It is now clear that, as c →∞, (6.82) and (6.83) give respectively ϵ−,n =2ωn, n =0, 1, 2,... , ϵ+,n =2ω(n +1) . (6.84) The corresponding wave functions, in this case, have the forms ψ−,n(x)= B−,n e− 1 2 ωx2 H2n(√ωx) , ψ+,n(x)= B+,n e− 1 2 ωx2 H2n+1(√ωx) . (6.85) This is indeed quite interesting for it shows that the spectrum of H− contains the ground state with vanishing energy. Furthermore, all the other states of H− and H+ are degenerate in energy correspond- ing to even and odd Hermite polynomials as one would expect from superpartner states. (Basically, the delta function term in V− softens thedivergenceat x = 0.) Consequently, it is quite clear that if the supersymmetric “half” oscillator is deﬁned carefully by regularizing the superpotential, then, supersymmetry is manifest in the limit of removing the regularization. This should be contrasted with the gen- eral belief that supersymmetry is broken in this system (which is a consequence of using boundary conditions or, equivalently, of regu- larizing the potentials in a manner which violates supersymmetry). January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 142 132 6 Supersymmetry 6.5.2 Alternate regularization Of course, we should worry at this point as to how regularization independent our conclusion really is. Namely, our results appear to follow from the matching conditions in the presence of singular delta potential terms and, consequently, it is worth investigating whether our conclusions would continue to hold with an alternate regulariza- tion of the superpotential which would not introduce such singular terms to the potentials. With this in mind, let us choose a regularized superpotential of the form W (x)= ωxθ(x)+ λxθ(−x) . (6.86) Here λ is the regularization parameter and we are to take the limit |λ|→∞ at the end. Once again, we note that, although both signs of λ appear to be allowed, existence of a normalizable ground state would select λ> 0. This regularized superpotential would now lead to the pair of supersymmetric potentials of the form V−(x)= 1 2 [(ω2x2 − ω)θ(x)+(λ2x2 − λ)θ(−x)] , V+(x)= 1 2 [(ω2x2 + ω)θ(x)+(λ2x2 + λ)θ(−x)] . (6.87) There are no singular delta potential terms with this regularization. In fact, the regularization merely introduces a supersymmetric pair of oscillators for x< 0 whose frequency is to be taken to inﬁnity at the end. Since there is a harmonic oscillator potential for both x> 0 and x< 0, the solutions are straightforward. They are the parabolic cylinder functions which we have mentioned earlier. Now matching the wave function and its ﬁrst derivative at x = 0 for each of the Hamiltonians and taking the ratio, we obtain 1 √λ Γ(− ϵ− 2λ ) Γ(− ϵ− 2λ + 1 2 ) = 1 √ω Γ(− ϵ− 2ω ) Γ(− ϵ− 2ω + 1 2 ) , (6.88) 1 √λ Γ(− ϵ+ 2λ + 1 2 ) Γ(− ϵ+ 2λ +1) = 1 √ω Γ(− ϵ+ 2ω + 1 2 ) Γ(− ϵ+ 2ω +1) . (6.89) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 143 6.6 References 133 It is clear now that, as λ →∞, Eqs. (6.88) and (6.89) give respec- tively ϵ−,n =2ωn, n =0, 1, 2,..., ϵ+,n =2ω(n +1) . (6.90) The corresponding wave functions are given by ψ−,n(x)= B−,n e− 1 2 ωx2 H2n(√ωx), ψ+,n(x)= B+,n e− 1 2 ωx2 H2n+1(√ωx) . (6.91) These are, of course, the same energy levels and wave functions as obtained in Eqs. (6.84) and (6.85) respectively showing again that supersymmetry is manifest. Furthermore, this shows that this con- clusion is independent of the regularization used as long as the regu- larization preserves supersymmetry which can be achieved by prop- erly regularizing the superpotential. This analysis can be carried out in a straight forward manner to more complicated superpotentials and the conclusions hold without any change. 6.6 References A. Das and W. J. Huang,Phys. Rev.

In such a case, we use perturbation theory (which we have already discussed) and perturbation theory brings out many inter- esting properties of the system. However, by deﬁnition perturbation theory cannot provide information about nonperturbative aspects of the theory. For example, the Born approximations used in scatter- ing theory give more accurate estimates of the scattering amplitudes as we go to higher orders of perturbation, but we cannot obtain in- formation about the bound states of the system from this analysis. Similarly, even though we may be able to obtain the energy levels and the eigenstates for the motion of a particle in a potential well by using perturbation theory, we will never learn about barrier pene- tration from such an analysis. These are inherently nonperturbative phenomena. It is, therefore, useful to develop an approximation scheme which brings out some of these nonperturbative characteristics. The WKB method provides such an approximation scheme. The basic idea be- hind this is quite simple. Let us assume that we have a particle moving in a complicated potential V (x). Then, the stationary states of the system will satisfy the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation given by (− ℏ2 2m d2 dx2 + V (x)) ψ(x)= Eψ(x) . (7.1) Here E is a constant representing the energy of the state. We know that if the potential were a constant, namely, if 135 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 146 136 7 Semi-classical methods V (x)= V = constant, (7.2) then, the solutions of Eq. (7.1) will be plane waves (for E> V )of the form ψ(x)= Ae± i ℏ px , (7.3) where p = √ 2m(E − V ) . (7.4) When the potential changes with the coordinate, but changes slowly, then it is easy to convince ourselves that within a region where the potential does not change appreciably, the solutions of Eq. (7.1) can still be written as plane waves of the form of Eq. (7.3) with p(x)= √2m(E − V (x)) . (7.5) It is clear, therefore, that we can try a general solution to the time- independent Schr¨odinger equation Eq. (7.1) of the form ψ(x)= NA(x) eiB(x) , (7.6) where N is a normalization constant and furthermore, noting that we can write (for non-negative A(x)) A(x)= eln A(x) , (7.7) we conclude that the general solution of Eq. (7.1) can be repre- sented as a phase where the phase, in general, is complex. Since the Schr¨odinger operator depends on ℏ, the phase clearly will also be a function of ℏ. With all these information, let us write the general solution of the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation to have the form ψ(x)= Ne i ℏ φ(x) . (7.8) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 147 7.1 WKB approximation 137 If we substitute this wave function back into the Schr¨odinger equation (Eq. (7.1)), we obtain d2ψ(x) dx2 + 2m ℏ2 (E − V (x))ψ(x)=0, or, (− 1 ℏ2 (φ′(x))2 + i ℏ φ′′(x)+ 2m ℏ2 (E − V (x))) e i ℏ φ(x) =0, or, ( 1 ℏ2 (−(φ′(x))2 +2m(E − V (x))) + i ℏ φ′′(x)) =0 . (7.9) So far, everything has been exact. Let us next assume a power series expansion for φ(x) of the form (such an expansion is meaningful since Eq. (7.9) has the structure of a Laurent series in ℏ) φ(x)= φ0(x)+ ℏφ1(x)+ ℏ2φ2(x)+ ··· . (7.10) (We comment here parenthetically that an expansion in powers of ℏ is very interesting in relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories and leads to the loop expansion.) It is clear, then, that φ0(x) will correspond to the classical phase since that is what will survive in the limit ℏ → 0. Other terms in the series, therefore, represent quantum corrections to the classical phase. Substituting the power series back into Eq. (7.9), we obtain 1 ℏ2 [−(φ′ 0(x)+ ℏφ′ 1(x)+ ··· )2 +2m(E − V (x))] + i ℏ (φ′′ 0(x)+ ℏφ′′ 1(x)+ ··· ) =0, or, 1 ℏ2 (−(φ′ 0(x))2 +2m(E − V (x))) + 1 ℏ (iφ′′ 0(x) − 2φ′ 0(x)φ′ 1(x)) + O(ℏ0)=0 . (7.11) For this to be true, the coeﬃcients of the individual powers of ℏ in Eq. (7.11) must be zero. Equating the coeﬃcient of the 1 ℏ2 term to zero, we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 148 138 7 Semi-classical methods − (φ′ 0(x))2 +2m(E − V (x)) = 0, or, (φ′ 0(x))2 =2m(E − V (x)) = p2(x), or,φ′ 0(x)= ±p(x), or,φ0(x)= ± x∫ x0 dx′ p(x′) . (7.12) Here x0 is a reference coordinate and p(x) denotes the momentum of the particle at the point x deﬁned by Eq. (7.5), corresponding to motion with energy E. Furthermore, let us note that even though both the signs of the solution for φ′ 0 are allowed in Eq. (7.12), con- sistency of the subsequent relations will pick out only the positive sign. (The right and the left moving waves would, then, correspond to x>x0 or x<x0 respectively.) This, therefore, determines the classical phase to be φ0(x)= x∫ x0 dx′ p(x′) . (7.13) If we keep only the leading order term in the expansion of φ(x), then the wave function would have the form ψ(x)= Ne i ℏ φ0(x) = Ne i ℏ x∫ x0 dx′ p(x′) . (7.14) The time-dependent stationary wave function, in this case, would be given by ψ(x, t)= e− i ℏ Etψ(x) = Ne− i ℏ Et+ i ℏ x∫ x0 dx′ p(x′) = Ne i ℏ t∫ 0 dt′ (p ˙x−E) = Ne i ℏ S[xcl] . (7.15) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 149 7.1 WKB approximation 139 This is exactly what we would expect in the classical limit. Let us next determine the ﬁrst order correction to the classical phase. Setting the coeﬃcient of the 1 ℏ term in Eq. (7.11) to zero, we obtain iφ′′ 0(x) − 2φ′ 0(x)φ′ 1(x)=0, or,φ′ 1(x)= i 2 φ′′ 0(x) φ′ 0(x) = i 2 (ln φ′ 0(x))′ , or,φ1(x)= i 2 ln φ′ 0(x)= i 2 ln p(x) . (7.16) The constant of integration in Eq. (7.16) can be absorbed into the normalization constant N of the wave function. We note here that this selects out the positive root for φ′ 0(x) in Eq. (7.12). (Remember that a scalar quantum mechanical wave function is assumed to be single valued.) Thus, keeping only the ﬁrst order correction to the classical phase, we can write the wave function to be ψ(x) ≃ Ne i ℏ (φ0(x)+ℏφ1(x)) = Ne i ℏ ( x∫ dx′ p(x′)+ iℏ 2 ln p(x)) = N √ p(x) e i ℏ x∫ dx′ p(x′) . (7.17) This is known as the WKB approximation for the quantum mechani- cal wave function of the system. This approximation, clearly, breaks down for small p(x) and in particular when p(x)=0 . (7.18) Namely, at the classical turning points, the classical momentum van- ishes and, consequently, the WKB approximation breaks down and we must reexamine the Schr¨odinger equation and its solutions more carefully in these regions. From the form of the WKB wave function in Eq. (7.17), we note that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 150 140 7 Semi-classical methods ψ∗(x)ψ(x) ∝ 1 p(x) . (7.19) In other words, the probability density, in this case, is inversely pro- portional to the momentum or the velocity of the particle. This is, of course, what we would expect from classical considerations alone. Namely, classically, we would qualitatively expect that the system is more likely to be found at points where its velocity is smaller (where it is likely to spend more time). Thus, the WKB approximation gives us a quantum mechanical wave function which retains some of the classical properties. It is for this reason that the WKB approxima- tion is often also called the semi-classical approximation. x V (x) xa xb E Figure 7.1: A general potential with two classical turning points at xa and xb. Let us consider a particle moving in a potential of the form shown in Fig. 7.1. Then, the normalization constant for the WKB wave function can be determined approximately in the following way. Since the wave function damps outside the potential well, we can write the normalization condition to be approximately ∞∫ −∞ dxψ∗(x)ψ(x) ≃ xb∫ xa dxψ∗(x)ψ(x)= |N |2 xb∫ xa dx p(x) =1 . (7.20) Recalling that the classical period of oscillation is related to the inte- gral above as (since dx =dtv(x), as v(x) → 0atthe turningpoints dx also vanishes and the integral ∫ dx v(x) remains ﬁnite) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 151 7.2Saddlepoint method 141 xb∫ xa dx p(x) = 1 m xb∫ xa dx v(x) = 1 m tb∫ ta dt = Tcl 2m , (7.21) where Tcl denotes the classical period of motion, we obtain |N |2 Tcl 2m =1, or,N = N ∗ = √ 2m Tcl . (7.22) Therefore, we can write the normalized WKB wave function to be ψ(x) ≃ √ 2m Tcl p(x) e i ℏ x∫ dx′ p(x′) = √ ω πv(x) e i ℏ x∫ dx′ p(x′) , (7.23) where ω = 2π Tcl denotes the classical angular frequency of motion. 7.2 Saddle point method Let us consider an integral of the form I = ∞∫ −∞ dxe 1 a f (x) , (7.24) where a is a small constant parameter. Furthermore, let us assume that the function f (x) (which is in general a complicated function) has an extremum at x = x0 which is a maximum. In other words, we are assuming that f ′(x)∣ ∣x=x0 =0 , f ′′(x)∣ ∣x=x0 < 0 . (7.25) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 152 142 7 Semi-classical methods We can now expand the function around this extremum as (the linear or the ﬁrst derivative term vanishes because of the ﬁrst relation in Eq. (7.25)) f (x)= f (x0)+ 1 2 (x − x0)2 f ′′(x0)+ O((x − x0)3) . (7.26) Substituting this back into the integral in Eq. (7.24), we obtain I = ∞∫ −∞ dxe 1 a (f (x0)+ 1 2 (x−x0)2f ′′(x0)+O((x−x0)3)) = e 1 a f (x0) ∞∫ −∞ dxe 1 a (− 1 2 (x−x0)2|f ′′(x0)|+O((x−x0)3)) = e 1 a f (x0) ∞∫ −∞ dy √ae(− 1 2 y2|f ′′(x0)|+O(√ay3)) ≃ e 1 a f (x0) √a √ 2π |f ′′(x0)| = √ 2πa |f ′′(x0)| e 1 a f (x0). (7.27) It is easy to see that the terms we neglected are of higher order in a and, therefore, this is the most dominant contribution to the integral when a is small. Im x Re x Figure 7.2: Saddle point of a function in the complex plane. Note from Eq. (7.26) that if we consider the function in the complex x-plane, then along the imaginary axis it has a minimum at the extremal point as shown in Fig. 7.2. Therefore, the extremal January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 153 7.2Saddlepoint method 143 point of the function f (x) is really a saddle point in the complex x-plane, hence the name, the saddle point method for such a calcula- tion. Let us also note that the direction of our integration has been along the real axis (which is the direction of steepest descent) and, therefore, this method of evaluating the integral is also referred to as the method of steepest descent. It is worth emphasizing here that if the function in the exponent has several extrema, then the value of the integral will approximately equal the sum of the contributions from each of the extrema. This method is quite useful in obtaining approximate values for complicated integrals. As an example, let us analyze the behavior of the Gamma function for large values of its argument. The Gamma function has the integral representation given by Γ(n +1) = n!= ∞∫ 0 dxxn e−x = ∞∫ 0 dxe(−x+n ln x) = ∞∫ 0 dxen(ln x− x n ) . (7.28) Let us next assume that n is very large. This would, then, correspond to 1 a in our previous discussion in Eq. (7.24). In the present case, f (x)=ln x − x n , f ′(x)= 1 x − 1 n . (7.29) Requiring the ﬁrst derivative to vanish gives x0 = n, f (x0)=ln x0 − x0 n =(ln n − 1) . (7.30) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 154 144 7 Semi-classical methods Furthermore, f ′′(x)= − 1 x2 , (7.31) and, therefore, we have f ′′(x0)= − 1 n2 < 0 . (7.32) Therefore, x0 = n is a maximum of the function and, in this case, is the only extremum. As a result, for large n, we can write Γ(n +1) ≃ enf (x0) ∞∫ 0 dxen(− 1 2n2 (x−x0)2) = enf (x0) ∞∫ 0 dxe− 1 2n (x−x0)2 ≃ enf (x0) ∞∫ −∞ dxe− 1 2n (x−x0)2 = √2πn enf (x0) = √2πn en(ln n−1), or,n! ≃ √2πn ( n e )n , for large n. (7.33) (Since x0 = n is large and positive, we have extended the integration to the negative axis in the intermediate step because the contribution from this region is negligible.) The result in Eq. (7.33) is known as Stirling’s approximation for the Gamma function which holds when n is large. Sometimes, this is also written in the form ln n! ≃ n(ln n − 1), for large n. (7.34) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 155 7.3 Semi-classical methods in path integrals 145 7.3 Semi-classical methods in path integrals The saddle point method or the method of steepest descent can be applied to path integrals as well. Note that so far we have only evaluated path integrals which involve quadratic actions. But any realistic theory will involve interactions which are inherently nonlin- ear. The path integral cannot always be evaluated exactly for such systems and the method of steepest descent gives rise to a very useful approximation in such a case. Let us consider a general action S[x] which is not necessarily quadratic. The transition amplitude associated with this action, as we have seen, is given by (see Eq. (2.29)) ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩ = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] . (7.35) Since ℏ is a small parameter, this integral is similar to the one in Eq. (7.24), but is not exactly in the same form. Namely, this inte- gral is oscillatory. However, we know that, in such a case, we can rotate to the Euclidean space as we have discussed earlier and the integrand becomes well behaved. We will continue to use the real time description keeping in mind the fact that in all our discussions, we are assuming that the actual calculations are always done in the Euclidean space and then the results are rotated back to Minkowski space. Let us recall that the classical trajectory satisﬁes the Euler- Lagrange equation (see Eq. (1.31) or (3.10)) δS[x] δx(t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x=xcl =0 . (7.36) Therefore, it deﬁnes an extremum of the exponent in the path inte- gral. Furthermore, the action is a minimum for the classical trajec- tory (when gravitation is not involved). Thus, we can expand the action around the classical trajectory as we have done earlier in the case of the harmonic oscillator. Namely, let us deﬁne x(t)= xcl(t)+ η(t) . (7.37) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 156 146 7 Semi-classical methods Then, we have S[x]= S[xcl + η] = S[xcl]+ 1 2 ∫∫ dt1dt2 η(t1) δ2S[xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2)+ O(η3). (7.38) Substituting this back into the transition amplitude in Eq. (7.35), we obtain ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩ = N ∫ Dηe i ℏ (S[xcl]+ 1 2 ∫∫ dt1dt2η(t1) δ2S[xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2)+O(η3)) ≃ Ne i ℏ S[xcl] ∫ Dηe i 2ℏ ∫∫ dt1dt2η(t1) δ2S[xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2) = N √ det ( 1 ℏ δ2S[xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) ) e i ℏ S[xcl] , (7.39) where we have used the result of Eq. (4.3). (We are also keeping the ℏ term explicitly to bring out the quantum nature of the calculations.) Clearly, the saddle point method breaks down if det 1 ℏ δ2S[xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) =0 . (7.40) Normally, this happens when there is some symmetry or its spon- taneous breakdown present in the theory. When this happens, the path integral has to be evaluated more carefully using the method of collective coordinates as we will discuss in the next chapter. We note here that the form of the transition amplitude in the saddle point approximation in Eq. (7.39) is surprisingly similar in form to the WKB wave function in Eq. (7.23). (Recall from Eq. (1.38) that the transition amplitude is the Schr¨odinger wave function for a delta function source.) In fact, the phases are identical (for example, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 157 7.3 Semi-classical methods in path integrals 147 see Eq. (7.15)). It is the multiplying factors that we readily do not see to be comparable. We will describe below, without going into too much detail, how we can, in fact, relate the two multiplying factors as well. Let us note that a general action has the form S[x]= tf∫ ti dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 − V (x)) . (7.41) For simplicity, we will choose ti = − T 2 and tf = T 2 (T = tf − ti)which will also be useful later. In this case, we note that δ2S[xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) = − (m d2 dt2 1 + V ′′(xcl)) δ(t1 − t2) . (7.42) Therefore, we see that det ( 1 ℏ δ2S[xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) ) ∝ det ( 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) . (7.43) Thus, we are interested in evaluating determinants of the form det ( 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + W (x))) , (7.44) in the space of functions where η( T 2 )=0= η(− T 2 ). We have already evaluated such determinants earlier in connection with the harmonic oscillator (see Eq. (4.13)). Let us recall here some results which hold for determinants of operators containing general bounded potentials. With a little bit of analysis, it is possible to show that if (λ will be an eigenvalue of interest if ψ(λ) W ( T 2 ) = 0 as well) 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + W (x)) ψ(λ) W = λψ(λ) W , (7.45) with the initial value conditions ψ(λ) W (− T 2 )=0 and ˙ψ(λ) W (− T 2 )=1, then (for a general λ) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 158 148 7 Semi-classical methods det( 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + W1(x)) − λ) det( 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + W2(x)) − λ) = ψ(λ) W1( T 2 ) ψ(λ) W2( T 2 ) , (7.46) where W1(x)and W2(x) are two bounded potentials. We note that for λ coinciding with an eigenvalue of one of the operators, the left hand side will have a zero or a pole. But so will the right hand side for the same value of λ because in such a case ψ(λ) wouldcorrespondto an energy eigenfunction satisfying the vanishing boundary conditions at both the end points. Furthermore, for λ →∞, both sides equal 1 (basically, W (x) becomes irrelevant). Since both the left and the right hand sides of the above equation are meromorphic functions of λ with identical zeroes and poles and coincide for the value λ →∞, they must be equal. It follows from this result that det( 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + W1(x))) ψ(0) W1( T 2 ) = det( 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + W2(x))) ψ(0) W2( T 2 ) = constant . (7.47) That is, this ratio is independent of the particular form of the po- tential W (x) and can be used to deﬁne the normalization constant in the path integral. We will deﬁne a particular normalization later. But, for the moment, let us use this result to write the transition amplitude in Eq. (7.39) in the form ⟨xf ,tf |xi,ti⟩ = N √ det ( 1 ℏ (m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) e i ℏ S[xcl] = N √ ψ(0) V ′′( T 2 ) e i ℏ S[xcl] . (7.48) Let us note that by deﬁnition (see Eq. (7.45)), ψ(0) V ′′(t) satisﬁes the equation (it is a solution with λ = 0 with the given initial conditions, but may not satisfy ψ(0) V ′′( T 2 ) = 0 unless the operator has a zero eigenvalue (mode)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 159 7.3 Semi-classical methods in path integrals 149 (m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl)) ψ(0) V ′′(t)=0 . (7.49) We note here that the classical equations (Euler-Lagrange equa- tions) following from our action have the form (see Eq. (1.31)) m d2xcl dt2 + V ′(xcl)=0 . (7.50) It follows from this that d dt (m d2xcl dt2 + V ′(xcl)) =0, or,m d2 dt2 ( dxcl dt ) + V ′′(xcl) dxcl dt =0, or, (m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl)) dxcl dt =0 . (7.51) Comparing with Eq. (7.49), we readily identify that ψ(0) V ′′(t) ∝ dxcl dt ∝ p(xcl) . (7.52) Consequently, we recognize that we can write the transition ampli- tude in Eq. (7.48) also in the form 〈xf , T 2 |xi, − T 2 〉 = N √ p(xf ) e i ℏ S[xcl] . (7.53) The correspondence with the WKB wave function in Eq. (7.23) is now complete and we recognize that the method of steepest descent in the case of path integrals merely gives the WKB approximation. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 160 150 7 Semi-classical methods 7.4 Double well potential As an application of the WKB method, let us consider a particle moving in one dimension in an anharmonic potential of the form V (x)= g2 8 (x2 − a2)2 , (7.54) where g and a are real constants. Consequently, the action has the form S[x]= ∫ dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 − g2 8 (x2 − a2)2) . (7.55) The potential in Eq. (7.54), when plotted, has the shape of a double well as shown in Fig. 7.3. This is a very interesting potential and shows up in all branches of physics in diﬀerent forms. Note that it is an even potential with a local maximum at the origin (x =0). The two minima of the potential are symmetrically located at x = ±a. (7.56) x V (x) −a a g2a4 8 Figure 7.3: Double well potential. The height of the potential at the origin is given by V (x =0)= g2a4 8 . (7.57) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 161 7.4 Double well potential 151 Let us also deﬁne here for later use V ′′(x = ±a)= g2a2 = mω2 , (7.58) where we can identify ω with the natural angular frequency of har- monic oscillations near the minima. We note from Eq. (7.57) that for an inﬁnitely large coupling, the potential separates into two symmetrical wells with an inﬁnite barrier. The motion of the particle is easy to analyze in this case. Each well has quantized levels of energy and if the particle is in one of the wells, then it stays there forever. Namely, there will be no tunneling from one well to the other. Furthermore, from the symmetry of the problem at hand (namely, x ↔−x), we conclude that both the wells in the present case will have degenerate energy levels. Thus, if ψ0(x) represents the ground state wave function in the well in the positive x-axis with energy E0,then ψ0(−x) will describe the ground state wave function in the left well with the same energy. In fact, any linear combination of the two wave functions and, in particular, the combinations ψ1(x)= 1 √2 (ψ0(x)+ ψ0(−x)) , ψ2(x)= 1 √2 (ψ0(x) − ψ0(−x)) , (7.59) will also be degenerate in energy. When the coupling constant g is ﬁnite, then the potential barrier between the two wells is also ﬁnite. Consequently, the particle initially conﬁned to one of the wells can tunnel into the other well and the states of the two wells will mix. The reﬂection (parity) symmetry of the system (Hamiltonian) still requires that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are only even or odd linear combinations as described in Eq. (7.59). They will, however, not be degenerate in energy any longer because of tunneling and we wish to calculate the splitting in the energy levels due to tunneling using the WKB approximation. Let us note that ψ1(x) in Eq. (7.59) is a symmetric wave func- tion whereas ψ2(x) is anti-symmetric. Consequently, it is obvious that ψ1(x) would represent the ground state wave function of the January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 162 152 7 Semi-classical methods system (after taking tunneling into account). Let us write down the time-independent Schr¨odinger equations that various wave functions satisfy d2ψ0(x) dx2 + 2m ℏ2 (E0 − V (x))ψ0(x)=0 ,x ≥ 0 , (7.60) d2ψ1(x) dx2 + 2m ℏ2 (E1 − V (x))ψ1(x)=0 , (7.61) d2ψ2(x) dx2 + 2m ℏ2 (E2 − V (x))ψ2(x)=0 . (7.62) Furthermore, let us assume, for simplicity, that the wave functions are all real. If ψ0(x) denotes the wave function in the well that is on the right (with x ≥ 0), then, we can easily see that its value will be vanishingly small in the well on the left (with x ≤ 0). Thus, we can normalize the wave function as ∞∫ 0 dxψ2 0(x) ≃ 1 . (7.63) Let us similarly note that if ψ0(−x) denotes the wave function in the left well, then it would have a vanishingly small value in the right well. Consequently, a product such as ψ0(x)ψ0(−x) will be negligible everywhere. Therefore, we see from Eq. (7.59) that ψ1(x)ψ0(x) ≃ 1 √2 ψ2 0(x),x ≥ 0, (7.64) so that ∞∫ 0 dxψ1(x)ψ0(x) ≃ 1 √2 ∞∫ 0 dxψ2 0(x) ≃ 1 √2 . (7.65) Let us next multiply Eq. (7.60) by ψ1(x) and Eq. (7.61) by ψ0(x) and subtract one from the other. This gives January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 163 7.4 Double well potential 153 ψ1(x) d2ψ0(x) dx2 − ψ0(x) d2ψ1(x) dx2 + 2m ℏ2 (E0 − E1)ψ1(x)ψ0(x)=0 . (7.66) Integrating this equation and using Eq. (7.65), we obtain ∞∫ 0 dx (ψ1(x) d2ψ0(x) dx2 − ψ0(x) d2ψ1(x) dx2 ) + 2m ℏ2 (E0 − E1) ∞∫ 0 dxψ1(x)ψ0(x)=0, or, 2m ℏ2 (E0 − E1) 1 √2 = − (ψ1(x)ψ′ 0(x) − ψ0(x)ψ′ 1(x))∣ ∣∞ 0 = ψ1(0)ψ′ 0(0) − ψ0(0)ψ′ 1(0), or,E0 − E1 = ℏ2 √2m (ψ1(0)ψ′ 0(0) − ψ0(0)ψ′ 1(0)) . (7.67) Here we have used Eq. (7.65) as well as the fact that the quantum mechanical bound state wave functions and their derivatives vanish at spatial inﬁnity. Let us also note that since ψ1(x)= 1 √2 (ψ0(x)+ ψ0(−x)) , ψ1(0) = √2 ψ0(0) , ψ′ 1(0) = 0 . (7.68) Substituting this back into Eq. (7.67), we obtain E0 − E1 = ℏ2 √2m √2ψ0(0)ψ′ 0(0) = ℏ2 m ψ0(0)ψ′ 0(0) . (7.69) It is at this point that we would like to use the WKB approxi- mation. We recall from Eq.

(7.70) Here, we note that v(0) = √ 2 m (V (0) − E0),V (0) ≫ E0 . (7.71) Putting these back, we obtain E0 − E1 = ℏ2 m mv(0) ℏ (ψ0(0))2 = ℏv(0) ω πv(0) e− 2 ℏ a∫ 0 dx |p(x)| = ℏω π e− 2 ℏ a∫ 0 dx |p(x)| . (7.72) This is thesplitting in theenergylevel of thetrueground statefrom that of the inﬁnite well. We can similarly show that E2 − E0 = ℏω π e− 2 ℏ a∫ 0 dx |p(x)| , (7.73) and, consequently, E2 − E1 = 2ℏω π e− 2 ℏ a∫ 0 dx |p(x)| , (7.74) which gives the splitting between the two degenerate levels in this approximation. The damping exponential in Eq. (7.74) reﬂects the eﬀects of tunneling. In fact, note that because of the reﬂection symmetry in theproblem,wecan write January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 165 7.4 Double well potential 155 e− 2 ℏ a∫ 0 dx |p(x)| = e− 1 ℏ a∫ −a dx |p(x)| , (7.75) and this gives the coeﬃcient for tunneling from the minimum at x = −a to the one at x = a. This, of course, assumes that the particle under consideration has vanishing energy. In reality, however, we know that the quantum mechanical ground state energy is nonzero in general. In fact, if we approximate the potential near each of the minima by a harmonic oscillator potential, then we can identify the ground state energy of the system with E0 = ℏω 2 . (7.76) This would, then, imply that the turning points for motion in both the wells, in this case, are given by (see Fig. 7.4) 1 2 mω2(x − a)2 = E0 = ℏω 2 , or,x − a = ± √ ℏ mω , or,xI = a ± √ ℏ mω , (7.77) and, similarly, 1 2 mω2(x + a)2 = E0 = ℏω 2 , or,x + a = ± √ ℏ mω , or,xII = −a ± √ ℏ mω . (7.78) The tunneling from one well to the other in this case, therefore, would correspond to tunneling from −a + √ ℏ mω to a − √ ℏ mω . Cor- respondingly, for a more accurate estimation of the splitting in the energy levels, we can replace the exponential in Eq. (7.74) by January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 166 156 7 Semi-classical methods x V (x) −a a g2a4 8 E0 Figure 7.4: Turning points for the double well potential with ground state energy E0. e− 2 ℏ a∫ 0 dx |p(x)| → e− 2 ℏ a−√ ℏ mω∫ 0 dx |p(x)| . (7.79) Furthermore, recalling that (see Eq. (7.5)) |p(x)| = √ 2m(V (x) − E0) , (7.80) we can evaluate the exponent in a straightforward manner as a−√ ℏ mω∫ 0 dx |p(x)| = a−√ ℏ mω∫ 0 dx √ 2m ( g2 8 (x2 − a2)2 − ℏω 2 ) = a−√ ℏ mω∫ 0 dx mω(a2 − x2) 2a (1 − 4a2ℏ mω(a2 − x2)2 ) 1 2 ≃ a−√ ℏ mω∫ 0 dx ( mω(a2 − x2) 2a − aℏ (a2 − x2) ) .

This integral can be trivially done and has the value a−√ ℏ mω∫ 0 dx |p(x)| ≃ mωa2 3 − ℏ 2 + ℏ 2 ln √ ℏ mωa2 − ℏ 2 ln ( 2 − √ ℏ mωa2 ) + O(ℏ 3 2 ) = mωa2 3 + ℏ 2 ( ln e−1 +ln √ ℏ 4mωa2 − ln( 1 − √ ℏ 4mωa2 ) ) + O(ℏ 3 2 ), = 1 2 S0 + ℏ 2 ln √ ℏ 4mωa2e2 + O(ℏ 3 2 ) . (7.82) Here we have deﬁned S0 = 2mωa2 3 . (7.83) Substituting Eqs. (7.79) and (7.83) into Eq. (7.74), we obtain the splitting in the energy levels to be E2 − E1 ≃ 2ℏω π √ 4mωa2e2 ℏ e− 1 ℏ S0 = 4e π √mℏ ω 3 2 ae− 1 ℏ S0. (7.84) In the next chapter, we will calculate this energy splitting using the path integrals and compare the two results.

We recall from Eq. (2.29) that the transition amplitude is deﬁned as 〈xf , T 2 |xi, − T 2 〉 = 〈xf |e− i ℏ HT |xi〉 = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x], (8.1) where the action for the double well potential (see Eq. (7.55)) is given by S[x]= T 2∫ − T 2 dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 − V (x)) = T 2∫ − T 2 dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 − g2 8 (x2 − a2)2) . (8.2) As we have seen earlier in Chapter 4, the best way to evaluate the path integral is to go to the Euclidean space. Thus, by rotating to imaginary time t →−it , (8.3) and using Eq. (1.45) we obtain ⟨xf |e− 1 ℏ HT |xi⟩ = N ∫ Dxe− 1 ℏ SE [x] , (8.4) 159 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 170 160 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell where the Euclidean action has the form SE[x]= T 2∫ − T 2 dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 + V (x)) . (8.5) In the semi-classical approximation, we can evaluate the path integral by the saddle point method. The classical equation, which is obtained from the extremum of the action in Eq. (8.5), has the form δSE[x] δx(t) =0, or,m¨x − V ′(x)=0 , or,m¨x − g2 2 x(x2 − a2)=0 , (8.6) where we have used V (x)= g2 8 (x2 − a2)2 . (8.7) The Euclidean equations, therefore, correspond to a particle moving in an inverted potential (−V (x)), otherwise also known as the double humped potential shown in Fig. 8.1. The Euclidean energy associated with such a motion is correspondingly given by E = 1 2 m ˙x2 − V (x) . (8.8) Two solutions of the Euclidean classical equation of motion in Eq. (8.6) are obvious. Namely, x(t)= ±a, (8.9) satisfy the classical equation with E = 0 and with vanishing Eu- clidean action (SE = 0). In other words, the particle sits at rest on January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 171 8.1 Instantons 161 −V (x) x−a a Figure 8.1: Inverted double well potential in Euclidean space. top of one of the hills in such a case. Quantum mechanically, this would correspond to the case where the particle executes small oscil- lations at the bottom of either of the wells in the Minkowski space and these small oscillations can be approximated by a harmonic oscil- lator motion. (The other obvious solution to the Euclidean equation of motion Eq. (8.6) corresponds to x(t)=0, (8.10) which, in fact, has a lower energy value (E = − g2a4 8 )ascan be checked from Eq. (8.8). However, the action (see Eq. (8.5)) corre- sponding to this solution is inﬁnite in the limit T →∞ and, con- sequently, does not contribute to the path integral.) On the other hand, in the large T limit, (namely, when T →∞) in which we are ultimately interested, there are other nontrivial solutions to the Eu- clidean equation of motion in Eq. (8.6) which play an important role in evaluating the path integral. Let xcl(t)= ±a tanh ω(t − tc) 2 , (8.11) where tc is a constant and we have identiﬁed as in Eq. (7.58) mω2 = V ′′(±a)= g2a2, or, ω a = g √m . (8.12) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 172 162 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell Then, we see that ˙xcl = ± aω 2 sech2 ω(t − tc) 2 = ± aω 2 (1 − x2 cl a2 ) = ∓ ω 2a (x2 cl − a2) = ∓ g 2√m (x2 cl − a2)= ∓ √ 2V (xcl) m , (8.13) ¨xcl = ∓ ω 2a 2xcl ˙xcl = ∓ ω a xcl (∓ ω 2a (x2 cl − a2)) = ω2 2a2 xcl(x2 cl − a2)= g2 2m xcl(x2 cl − a2) = 1 m V ′(xcl) . (8.14) Consequently, it follows that m¨xcl − V ′(xcl)=0 , (8.15) and we conclude that the solutions in Eq. (8.11) represent nontrivial solutions of the Euclidean equation of motion in Eq. (8.6). We note from Eq. (8.11) that, for these solutions, xcl(t →−∞)= ∓a, xcl(t →∞)= ±a. (8.16) These solutions, therefore, correspond to the particle starting out on top of one of the hills at t →−∞ and then moving over to the top of the other hill at t →∞ as shown in Fig. 8.2. Let us also note (see Eq. (8.13)) that for such solutions 1 2 m ˙x2 cl = 1 2 m × 2 m V (xcl)= V (xcl) .

Therefore, for such classical motion, the Euclidean energy deﬁned in Eq. (8.8) has the value E = 1 2 m ˙x2 cl − V (xcl)=0 . (8.18) In other words, these solutions are degenerate in energy with the two trivial solutions in Eq. (8.9). The value of the action corresponding to such a classical motion can be easily calculated to be SE[xcl]= ∞∫ −∞ dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 cl + V (xcl)) = m ∞∫ −∞ dt ˙x2 cl = m ±a∫ ∓a dxcl ˙xcl = m ±a∫ ∓a dxcl (∓ ω 2a (x2 cl − a2)) = ∓ mω 2a ( 1 3 x3 cl − xcla2)∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ±a ∓a = mω 2a 4a3 3 = 2 3 mωa2 = S0 , (8.19) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 174 164 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell wherewehaveused Eq.(8.13). Wenotethatthisactionhas thesame valueasthe S0 deﬁned in Eq. (7.83) in connection with the WKB calculation of the splitting of the energy levels for the double well. The solutions in Eq. (8.11) are, therefore, ﬁnite action solutions in the Euclidean space and have the graphical form as shown in Fig. 8.2. They are known respectively as the instanton and the anti-instanton solutions (classical solutions in Euclidean time). If we look at the Lagrangian for such a solution, then using Eq. (8.13) we ﬁnd that LE = 1 2 m ˙x2 cl + V (xcl)= m ˙x2 cl = m ( a2ω2 4 sech4 ω(t − tc) 2 ) = ma2ω2 4 sech4 ω(t − tc) 2 . (8.20) ttc 1 ω Figure 8.3: The value of the Euclidean Lagrangian for the classical motion as a function of t. In other words, the Lagrangian is fairly localized around t = tc with a width of about Δt ∼ 1 ω = √m ga . (8.21) It is in this sense that one says that instantons (anti-instantons) are localized solutions in Euclidean time with a size of about 1 ω .The January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 175 8.1 Instantons 165 constant tc, which signiﬁes the time when the solution reaches the valley of the Euclidean potential, is really arbitrary. This is a direct reﬂection of the time translation invariance in the theory. Just as we can have a one instanton or one anti-instanton so- lution, we can also have multi-instanton solutions in such a theory. However, before going into that, let us calculate the contribution of the one instanton or the one anti-instanton trajectory to the tran- sition amplitude. From our earlier discussion in Eq. (7.39) of the saddle point method in connection with path integrals, we conclude that (O.I. stands for “one instanton”) ⟨a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩O.I. = N ∫ Dxe− 1 ℏ SE [x] ≃ Ne− 1 ℏ SE [xcl] ∫ Dηe− 1 2ℏ ∫∫ dt1dt2 η(t1) δ2SE [xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2) = N √ det ( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) e− 1 ℏ S0. (8.22) Here we have deﬁned as before (the tc dependence has been put into the solutions explicitly) x(t)= xcl(t − tc)+ η(t − tc) , (8.23) and, for the one instanton case, we have already seen in Eq. (8.11) that, xcl(t − tc)= a tanh ω(t − tc) 2 . (8.24) Let us next analyze the determinant in Eq. (8.22) for the one instanton case in a bit more detail. We know from Eq. (8.13) that dxcl dt = aω 2 sech2 ω(t − tc) 2 , (8.25) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 176 166 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell and it satisﬁes the zero eigenvalue equation (see Eq. (7.51) rotated to imaginary time) (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl)) dxcl dt =0, (8.26) which can be checked easily using Eq. (8.25) as well as the fact that V ′′(xcl)= g2 2 (3x2 cl − a2) = mω2 2 (2 tanh2 ω(t − tc) 2 − sech2 ω(t − tc) 2 ) . (8.27) In fact, using Eq. (8.19), we can deﬁne the normalized zero eigenvalue solution of Eq. (8.26) as (∫ ∞ −∞ dtψ2 0(t)=1) ψ0(t−tc)= ( S0 m )− 1 2 dxcl dt = ( S0 m )− 1 2 aω 2 sech2 ω(t − tc) 2 . (8.28) As we had seen earlier in Eq. (7.47), the determinant in Eq. (8.22) can be obtained from this solution simply as det ( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) ∝ ψ0 ( T 2 − tc ) ,T →∞ . (8.29) But, from the form of the solution in Eq. (8.28), it is clear that lim T →∞ ψ0 ( T 2 − tc ) → 0. (8.30) In other words, in this case, the determinant identically vanishes. The reason for this is obvious, namely, in the present case ψ0(t) happens to be an exact eigenstate of the operator (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl)) with zero eigenvalue. (This means that ψ0(± T 2 −tc)=0 for T →∞.) This is what one means in saying that there is a zero mode in this theory. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 177 8.2 Zero modes 167 8.2 Zero modes As we have argued before, a zero mode is present in the theory when- ever there is a symmetry operative in the system. To see this, let us recall that the determinant in Eq. (8.22) arose from integrating out the Gaussian ﬂuctuations. Therefore, the term that we need to re-examine is ∫ Dηe− 1 2ℏ ∫∫ dt1dt2 η(t1) δ2SE [xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2) . (8.31) Note that, in this case, since ψ0(t) represents a zero mode of the operator δ2SE [xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) , if we make a change of the integration variable as η(t) → η(t)+ δη(t),δη(t)= ϵψ0(t) , (8.32) where ϵ is an inﬁnitesimal constant parameter, then the Gaussian does not change. In other words, the transformation in Eq. (8.32) deﬁnes a symmetry of the quadratic action. Another way to visualize the trouble is to note that if we were to expand the ﬂuctuations around the classical trajectory in a complete basis of the (normalized) eigenstates of the operator δ2SE [xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) , then we can write η(t)= ∑ n≥0 cnψn(t), Dη(t)= ∏ n≥0 dcn . (8.33) Substituting this expansion into Eq. (8.31), we obtain ∫ Dηe− 1 2ℏ ∫∫ dt1dt2 η(t1) δ2SE [xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2) = ∫ ∏ n≥0 dcn e− 1 2ℏ ∑ n>0 λn c2 n = ∫ dc0 ∫ ∏ n>0 dcn e− 1 2ℏ ∑ n>0 λn c2 n , (8.34) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 178 168 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell where λn denote the eigenvalues associated with the eigenstates ψn. Here we note that the zero mode drops out of the exponent and, consequently, there is no Gaussian damping for the dc0 integration. In such a case, we have to evaluate the integral more carefully. To understand further the origin of the problem as well as to ﬁnd a possible way out of this diﬃculty, let us examine a simple two dimensional integral. Let I = ∞∫∫ −∞ dx1 dx2 e 1 a f (x) = ∞∫∫ −∞ dx1 dx2 e 1 a ( 1 2 x2−g2(x2)2) . (8.35) Here a is a small parameter, g> 0 and we have deﬁned f (x)= 1 2 x2 − g2(x2)2 , x2 = x2 1 + x2 2 . (8.36) This example is, in fact, quite analogous to the instanton calculation which we are interested in. The classical equation (extremum), in this case, leads to the maximum ∂f ∂x = x (1 − 4g2x2) =0 , or, |xcl| = 1 2g . (8.37) It is easy to see that the other solution, namely, xcl = 0, in this case, corresponds to a local minimum. The most general classical solution following from Eq. (8.37) can, therefore, be written as xcl,1 = 1 2g cos θ, xcl,2 = 1 2g sin θ, (8.38) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 179 8.2 Zero modes 169 where θ is an arbitrary constant angular parameter. This is very much like the arbitrary parameter tc which arises in the case of the instantons. In the present case, the presence of the angular parameter θ is a reﬂection of the rotational invariance of the function f (x)in Eq. (8.36). Expanding around the classical solution in Eq. (8.38), namely, choosing xα = xcl,α + ηα,α =1, 2, (8.39) we have f (x)= f (xcl + η) ≃ f (xcl)+ 1 2 ηα ∂2f (xcl) ∂xcl,α∂xcl,β ηβ + O(η3) . (8.40) From the form of f (x) in Eq. (8.36), we note that ∂2f (xcl) ∂xα,cl∂xβ,cl = δαβ(1 − 4g2x2 cl) − 8g2xcl,αxcl,β = −8g2xcl,αxcl,β . (8.41) In the matrix form, therefore, we can write ∂2f (xcl) ∂xcl,α∂xcl,β = −2 ( cos2 θ cos θ sin θ cos θ sin θ sin2 θ ) . (8.42) Thus, if we use the saddle point method naively, we would obtain the value of the integral in Eq. (8.35) to be I ≃ e 1 a f (xcl) ∫ dηα e 1 2a ηα ∂2f (xcl) ∂xcl,α∂xcl,β ηβ . (8.43) Let us note that the matrix ∂2f (xcl) ∂xcl,α∂xcl,β in Eq. (8.42) has two eigenvalues, λ =0, −2. As a result, the Gaussian integral in Eq. (8.43) does not exist. This is very much like the instanton calculation that we have done. In fact, it is easy to check from Eq. (8.42) that the January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 180 170 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell eigenstate of the matrix with zero eigenvalue has the form (note the similarity of this form with the zero mode in Eq. (8.28)) x0 = ( sin θ − cos θ ) = −2g d dθ (xcl,1 xcl,2 ) . (8.44) Consequently, under a transformation of the variables of integration of the form δ ( η1 η2 ) = ϵx0 = ϵ ( sin θ − cos θ ) = −2gϵ d dθ ( xcl,1 xcl,2 ) , (8.45) which we recognize as an inﬁnitesimal rotation, the quadratic expo- nent in Eq. (8.43) does not change. In fact, writing out the exponent explicitly, we have I ≃ e 1 a f (xcl) ∞∫∫ −∞ dη1dη2 e− 1 a (η1 cos θ+η2 sin θ)2 . (8.46) Furthermore, redeﬁning the variables as ˜η1 = η1 cos θ + η2 sin θ, ˜η2 = −η1 sin θ + η2 cos θ, (8.47) we note that we can write the integral in Eq. (8.46) also as I ≃ e 1 a f (xcl) ∞∫∫ −∞ d˜η1d˜η2 e− 1 a ˜η2 1 = e 1 a f (xcl) ∞∫ −∞ d˜η2 ∞∫ −∞ d˜η1 e− 1 a ˜η2 1 . (8.48) The analogy with the instanton case is now complete. There is no damping for the d˜η2 integration. That is the origin of the diver- gence and it is a consequence of rotational invariance in this case. In January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 181 8.3 The instanton integral 171 this simple example, the solution to the problem is obvious. Namely, since the function f (x) in Eq. (8.36) is rotationally invariant, it is appropriate to use circular (polar) coordinates. The angular integral, which will have no zero mode in this case, can be trivially performed giving a ﬁnite result, after which the saddle point approximation can be applied to the radial integral. This method generalizes readily to other systems with more degrees of freedom through what is known as the method of collective coordinates. This is what we will discuss next and we will use this method to evaluate the instanton integral. 8.3 The instanton integral In the case of the instanton, we have already seen in Eq. (8.34) that ∫ Dηe− 1 2ℏ ∫∫ dt1dt2 η(t1) δ2SE [xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2) = ∫ dc0 ∫ ∏ n>0 dcn e− 1 2ℏ ∑ n>0 λn c2 n , (8.49) which is divergent. The divergence, in the present case, is a con- sequence of time translation invariance, namely, the position of the center of the instanton can be arbitrary. So, following our earlier discussion of the rotationally symmetric example, we would like to replace the dc0 integration by an integration over the position of the center of the instanton. Let us discuss very brieﬂy how this is done. Let us recall that expanding around the instanton trajectory yields (here, as before, we have indicated explicitly the tc dependence of the solution) x(t)= xcl(t − tc)+ η(t − tc), or,x(t + tc)= xcl(t)+ η(t)= xcl(t)+ ∑ n≥0 cn ψn(t) . (8.50) (Since the trajectory is independent of the center of the instanton trajectory, the ﬂuctuations must balance out the tc dependence. Fur- thermore, η(t − tc) should really be written as η(t − tc,tc) to allow January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 182 172 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell for additional tc dependence.) Multiplying Eq. (8.50) with ψ0(t)and integrating over time, we obtain T 2∫ − T 2 dtx(t + tc)ψ0(t) = T 2∫ − T 2 dt ⎛ ⎝xcl(t)+ ∑ n≥0 cn ψn(t) ⎞ ⎠ ψ0(t) = T 2∫ − T 2 dt (( S0 m )− 1 2 xcl(t) dxcl(t) dt + c0ψ2 0(t) ) = 1 2 ( S0 m )− 1 2 x2 cl(t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ T 2 − T 2 + c0 = c0 . (8.51) The ﬁrst term vanishes because it has the same value at both the lim- its and the higher eigenfunctions, in the second term are orthogonal to ψ0(t) giving vanishing contribution. (It is worth emphasizing here that we are only interested in large T limits when all these results hold.) This simple analysis shows that c0 = c0(tc) . (8.52) Therefore, we can easily change the c0-integration to an integration over tc. To obtain the Jacobian of this transformation to the leading order, let us consider an inﬁnitesimal change in the path in Eq. (8.50) arising from a change in the coeﬃcient of the zero mode. Namely, let δη(t)= δc0 ψ0(t) , (8.53) where we assume that δc0 is inﬁnitesimal. In this case, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 183 8.3 The instanton integral 173 δx(t + tc)= δη(t)= δc0 ψ0(t)= δc0 ( S0 m )− 1 2 dxcl(t) dt , (8.54) wherewehaveused Eq.(8.28). However, wealsonotethatthisis precisely the change in the path that we would have obtained to the leading order had we translated the center of the instanton as tc → tc + δtc = tc + δc0 ( S0 m )− 1 2 . (8.55) Namely, in this case, δx(t + tc)= x(t + tc + δtc) − x(t + tc) ≃ δtc dx(t + tc) dt = δc0 ( S0 m )− 1 2 dx(t + tc) dt ≃ δc0 ( S0 m )− 1 2 dxcl(t) dt . (8.56) (Namely, we are neglecting contributions coming from dη(t) dt which are higher order.) Thus, from Eq. (8.55), we note that to leading order, we can determine the Jacobian of the transformation from the integration variable c0 to tc to be dc0(tc) dtc ≃ ( S0 m ) 1 2 . (8.57) A more direct way to arrive at this result is to note from Eq. (8.51) that since January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 184 174 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell c0(tc)= T 2∫ − T 2 dtx(t + tc)ψ0(t) dc0 dtc = T 2∫ − T 2 dt dx(t + tc) dtc ψ0(t) = T 2∫ − T 2 dt dx(t + tc) dt ψ0(t) = T 2∫ − T 2 dt ⎛ ⎝ dxcl(t) dt + ∑ n≥0 cn dψn(t) dt ⎞ ⎠ ψ0(t) = ( S0 m ) 1 2 T 2∫ − T 2 dtψ2 0(t)+ ∑ n>0 cn T 2∫ − T 2 dt dψn(t) dt ψ0(t), (8.58) where we have used Eq. (8.28). The n = 0 term drops out in the second term because for n = 0, the integrand is a total derivative of ψ2 0(t) which vanishes at both the limits. It is clear, therefore, that to leading order (since ψ0 is normalized to unity), dc0(tc) dtc = ( S0 m ) 1 2 + O(ℏ) . (8.59) Namely, we are using here the fact that the higher moments of a Gaussian of the kind that we are dealing with in Eq. (8.49) are higher orders in ℏ. Thus, we are ready to do the determinant calculation now. We substitute Eq. (8.57) or (8.59) into Eq. (8.49) to obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 185 8.4 Evaluating the determinant 175 ∫ Dηe− 1 2ℏ ∫∫ dt1dt2 η(t1) δ2SE [xcl] δxcl(t1)δxcl(t2) η(t2) = ( S0 m ) 1 2 T 2∫ − T 2 dtc ∫ ∏ n>0 dcn e− 1 2ℏ ∑ n>0 λn c2 n = ( S0 m ) 1 2 T 2∫ − T 2 dtc √ det′( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) . (8.60) Here det′ stands for the value of the determinant of the operator without the zero mode. Let us also note here that even though the dtc integral in Eq. (8.60) can be done trivially, we will leave it as it is for later purposes. Thus, from Eqs. (8.22) and (8.60) we obtain the form of the transition amplitude in the presence of an instanton to be ⟨a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩O.I. = N ( S0 m ) 1 2 e− 1 ℏ S0 √ det′( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) T 2∫ − T 2 dtc . (8.61) 8.4 Evaluating the determinant To evaluate det′ in Eq. (8.61), let us study the ratio of the determi- nants Δ(E)= det( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl)) − E) det( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + mω2) − E) = ∏ n (En − E) ∏ n (E(0) n − E) , (8.62) where the determinant in the denominator corresponds to that of a free harmonic oscillator (in Euclidean space) which we have already evaluated (and which does not have a zero mode). Here En,E(0) n January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 186 176 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell denote respectively the eigenvalues of the operators (whose deter- minants we are calculating when E = 0) in the numerator and the denominator. It is easy to see that both sides of Eq. (8.62) have the same analytic structure and, therefore must be equal. We note that Δ(E =0)=0 , (8.63) since there is a zero eigenvalue for the determinant in the numerator and further, Δ(E = ∞)=1 . (8.64) If we eliminate the zero mode in Eq. (8.62) by dividing it out, then we obtain − 1 E Δ(E) |E=0 = ∏ n>0 En ∏ n E(0) n , or, − ∂Δ(E) ∂E |E=0 = det′( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) det( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + mω2)) . (8.65) Clearly, if we can evaluate the left hand side of Eq. (8.65), then we would have evaluated det′ sincewealready know thevalue of the determinant for the harmonic oscillator. To evaluate this, let us consider the scattering problem for the one dimensional Schr¨odinger equation 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl)) ψ = Eψ, or, (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl)) ψ = ℏEψ . (8.66) If we deﬁne the asymptotic solutions (Jost functions) as lim t→∞ f+(t, E) → e−ikt, lim t→−∞ f−(t, E) → eikt , (8.67) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 187 8.4 Evaluating the determinant 177 wherewehaveused theasymptoticformof V ′′(xcl) (see, for example, Eq. (8.27)) and have identiﬁed lim t→±∞ V ′′(xcl) → mω2, k2 = ℏE m − ω2. (8.68) The Jost functions are two linearly independent (asymptotic) so- lutions (basically they correspond to the asymptotic incoming and outgoing solutions) of the Schr¨odinger equation in Eq. (8.66) and consequently, any general solution can be written as a linear com- bination of the two. In particular, we can write (the coeﬃcients of expansions can be related to scattering amplitudes) lim t→−∞ f+(t, E) → A+(E) eikt + B+(E) e−ikt , lim t→∞ f−(t, E) → B−(E) eikt + A−(E) e−ikt . (8.69) The linear independence of the Jost functions can be easily seen by calculating the Wronskian which is deﬁned as W (f+(t, E),f−(t, E)) = f+(t, E) ∂f−(t, E) ∂t − ∂f+(t, E) ∂t f−(t, E). (8.70) Using Eqs. (8.67) and (8.69), for t →−∞ this leads to 2ikB+(E) while in the limit t →∞ this takes the value 2ikB−(E). Further- more, since the Wronskian is time independent, it follows that W (f+(t, E),f−(t, E)) = 2ik B+(E)=2ik B−(E) . (8.71) This, in fact, shows that the two coeﬃcients B+(E)and B−(E)are identical. With a bit more analysis, they can also be shown to be equal to Δ(E), namely, B+(E)= B−(E)=Δ(E) . (8.72) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 188 178 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell Let us also recall from Eq. (8.28) that the zero mode of Eq. (8.66) has the asymptotic form lim t→±∞ ψ0(t) = lim t→±∞ ( S0 m )− 1 2 aω 2 sech2 ωt 2 → 2aω ( S0 m )− 1 2 e∓ωt = Ke∓ωt , (8.73) wherewehavedeﬁned K =2aω ( S0 m )− 1 2 . (8.74) Thus, from Eqs. (8.67), (8.68), (8.69) and (8.73), we note that we can identify (k(E =0)= −iω) lim |t|→∞ f±(t, E =0) → e−ω|t| = lim |t|→∞ 1 K ψ0(t) . (8.75) Comparing Eq. (8.75) with the asymptotic form of the Jost functions in Eqs. (8.67) and (8.69), we conclude that A+(E =0)=1,A−(E =0)=1 , B+(E =0)=0,B−(E =0)=0 . (8.76) Consequently, we obtain Δ(E =0)= B+(E =0)=0 , (8.77) a result which we already know. The asymptotic equations which the Jost functions satisfy (see Eqs. (8.66) and (8.68)) are − m ∂2f+(t, E) ∂t2 + mω2f+(t, E)= ℏEf+(t, E) , − m ∂2f−(t, E′) ∂t2 + mω2f−(t, E′)= ℏE′f−(t, E′) . (8.78) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 189 8.4 Evaluating the determinant 179 Multiplying the ﬁrst of these equations by f−(t, E′) and the second by f+(t, E) and subtracting one from the other, we obtain m (f+(t, E) ∂2f−(t, E′) ∂t2 − f−(t, E′) ∂2f+(t, E) ∂t2 ) = ℏ(E − E′)f+(t, E)f−(t, E′), or, ∂ ∂t (f+(t, E) ∂f−(t, E′) ∂t − f−(t, E′) ∂f+(t, E) ∂t ) = ℏ m (E − E′)f+(t, E)f−(t, E′), or, ∂ ∂t W (f+(t, 0),f−(t, E)) = − ℏ m Ef+(t, 0)f−(t, E), or, ∂2 ∂E∂t W (f+(t, 0),f−(t, E))∣ ∣ ∣ ∣E=0 = − ℏ m f+(t, 0)f−(t, 0) = − ℏ mK2 ψ2 0(t) . (8.79) Integrating this equation between (− T 2 , T 2 )with T →∞, we obtain lim E→0 ∂ ∂E W (f+(t, 0),f−(t, E))∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ t=∞ t=−∞ = − ℏ mK2 . (8.80) On the other hand, from the asymptotic form of the Jost func- tions in Eq. (8.69), we see that W (f+(t, 0),f−(t, E))|t=∞ t=−∞ = (e−ωt(ik B−(E)eikt − ik A−(E)e−ikt) + ωe−ωt(B−(E)eikt + A−(E)e−ikt)) t=∞ − (eωt ik eikt − ωeωteikt) t=−∞ = (e−ωt((ω + ik)eiktB−(E)+(ω − ik)e−iktA−(E))) t=∞ + ((ω − ik)e(ω+ik)t) t=−∞ , (8.81) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 190 180 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell from which we determine lim E→0 ∂ ∂E W (f+(t, 0),f−(t, E))∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∞ −∞ =2ω ∂B−(E) ∂E ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣E=0 =2ω ∂Δ(E) ∂E ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣E=0 . (8.82) Here we have used the identiﬁcation in Eq. (8.72) as well as the results of Eq. (8.76). Comparing Eqs. (8.80) and (8.82), then, we obtain 2ω ∂Δ(E) ∂E ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣E=0 = − ℏ mK2 , or, − ∂Δ(E) ∂E ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣E=0 = ℏ 2mωK2 . (8.83) Therefore, we determine the ratio in Eq. (8.65) to be det′( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) det( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + mω2)) = − ∂Δ(E) ∂E ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣E=0 = ℏ 2mωK2 . (8.84) The one instanton contribution in Eq. (8.61) can now be explic- itly determined and takes the form ⟨a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩O.I. = N √ det( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + ω2)) √ √ √ √ det( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + ω2)) det′( 1 ℏ (−m d2 dt2 + V ′′(xcl))) × ( S0 m ) 1 2 e− 1 ℏ S0 T 2∫ − T 2 dtc = ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 √ 2mω ℏ K ( S0 m ) 1 2 e− 1 ℏ S0 T 2∫ − T 2 dtc January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 191 8.5 Multi-instanton contributions 181 = ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 √ 2mω ℏ × 2aω ( S0 m )− 1 2 ( S0 m ) 1 2 e− 1 ℏ S0 T 2∫ − T 2 dtc = ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 r T 2∫ − T 2 dtc , (8.85) where we have used Eq. (8.84) as well as the value of the path integral for the harmonic oscillator given in Eq. (3.32) (rotated to Euclidean space with large Euclidean time which also determines the normal- ization constant). We have also deﬁned a new quantity r whose value is given by r =2 √ 2m ℏ ω 3 2 ae− 1 ℏ S0 . (8.86) The transition amplitude, in this case, separates into a product of two factors — the ﬁrst corresponding to the contribution of a simple harmonic oscillator arising from the trivial solution of the Euclidean equation of motion while the second giving the true contribution due to an instanton. We can, similarly, calculate the transition ampli- tude in the presence of an anti-instanton and it can be shown to be identical to the result obtained in Eq. (8.85). 8.5 Multi-instanton contributions As we had discussed earlier, a string of widely separated instan- tons and anti-instantons also satisﬁes the Euclidean classical equa- tion given in Eq. (8.6). The instanton density is small for weak coupling and, in such a case, the contribution of these multi-instanton solutions to the transition amplitude can be evaluated under an ap- proximation commonly known as the dilute gas approximation. A typical example of a “multi-instanton” solution has the form shown in Fig. 8.4. Let us consider a n-“instanton” solution for which the centers of the instantons at t1,t2, ··· ,tn satisfy January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 192 182 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 Figure 8.4: Graphical representation for a “multi-instanton” solu- tion. − T 2 ≤ tn ≤ tn−1 ··· ≤ t1 ≤ T 2 . (8.87) In such a case, the integral over the centers of the instantons gives T 2∫ − T 2 dt1 t1∫ − T 2 dt2 ··· tn−1∫ − T 2 dtn = T n n! . (8.88) Furthermore, since the instantons and the anti-instantons are as- sumed to be noninteracting in this dilute gas approximation, their contributions to the transition amplitude will simply be multiplica- tive. Thus, a n-“instanton” solution will contribute an amount (see Eqs. (8.85) and (8.88)) ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 rn T n n! = ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 (rT )n n! . (8.89) (Basically, the entire region can be divided into n-“instanton” re- gions and in each region we can divide the corresponding instanton determinant by a harmonic oscillator determinant leading to a factor of r for each region. The overall harmonic oscillator determinant for the entire region, necessary to compensate for the product of indi- vidual harmonic oscillator determinants, will give rise to the ﬁrst two factors.) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 193 8.5 Multi-instanton contributions 183 We have to recognize here that only an even number of instan- tons and anti-instantons (in total) can contribute to the transition amplitude of the form ⟨a|e− 1 ℏ HT |a⟩, ⟨−a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩ . (8.90) Similarly, only an odd number of instantons and anti-instantons (in total) can contribute to transition amplitudes of the form ⟨a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩, ⟨−a|e− 1 ℏ HT |a⟩ . (8.91) Adding all such “instanton” contributions, we see from Eq. (8.89) that we will have ⟨−a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩ = ∑ n ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 (rT )2n (2n)! = ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 cosh(rT ) = ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 (erT + e−rT ) 2 = 1 2 ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 (e−( ω 2 −r)T + e−( ω 2 +r)T ) . (8.92) Similarly, we can show that for odd numbers of “instanton” contri- butions, we will obtain ⟨a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩ = ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 e− ωT 2 sinh(rT ) = 1 2 ( mω πℏ ) 1 2 (e−( ω 2 −r)T − e−( ω 2 +r)T ) . (8.93) If we identify the two low lying states of the quantum Hamilto- nian as |±⟩ with energy eigenvalues E± respectively (these are what we had called E2,E1 respectively in the previous chapter), then we note that by inserting a complete set of energy states we will obtain for large T January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 194 184 8Pathintegralfor thedoublewell ⟨−a|e− 1 ℏ HT |− a⟩ ≃⟨−a|e− 1 ℏ HT |−⟩⟨−| − a⟩ + ⟨−a|e− 1 ℏ HT |+⟩⟨+|− a⟩ (8.94) = e− 1 ℏ E−T ⟨−a|−⟩⟨−| − a⟩ + e− 1 ℏ E+T ⟨−a|+⟩⟨+|− a⟩ . Comparing the exponents of these two terms with those in Eq. (8.92), we obtain E± = ℏ ( ω 2 ± r) . (8.95) Therefore, the splitting between the two energy levels of the quantum theory is determined to be ΔE = E+ − E− =2ℏr =2ℏ × 2 √ 2m ℏ ω 3 2 ae− 1 ℏ S0 =4 √2mℏ ω 3 2 ae− 1 ℏ S0 . (8.96) This splitting of energy levels calculated in the path integral for- malism can now be compared with the result obtained through the WKB approximation in Eq. (7.84) (remember that e π ≃ 0.88 while √2 ≃ 1.4). 8.6 References S. Coleman, The Uses of Instantons, Erice Lectures, 1977. B.

However, the method of path integrals generalizes naturally to systems with many particles or systems with many degrees of freedom. Let us consider a system with n-degrees of freedom characterized by the coordinates xα(t), α =1, 2, ··· ,n. These coordinates, for example, can denote the coordinates of n-particles in one dimension or the coordinates of a single particle in n-dimensions. If S[x] denotes the appropriate action for the system (namely, if it describes the dynamics of the system), then the transition amplitude in Eq. (2.29) can be easily shown to generalize to ⟨xα f ,tf |xα i ,ti⟩ = N ∫ Dxα e i ℏ S[xα] . (9.1) The action generically has the form S[xα]= tf∫ ti dtL(xα, ˙xα) , (9.2) and the integration in Eq. (9.1) is supposed to be over all paths start- ing at xα i at t = ti and ending at xα f at t = tf . We can also introduce appropriate sources, in this case, through the linear interaction S[xα,J α]= S[xα]+ tf∫ ti dtJ α(t)xα(t) , (9.3) 185 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 196 186 9 Path integral for relativistic theories to deﬁne the transition amplitude in the presence of these sources as (see Eq. (4.49)) ⟨xα f ,tf |xα i ,ti⟩J = N ∫ Dxα e i ℏ S[xα,J α] . (9.4) As we have seen earlier in Eqs. (4.47) and (4.62), this allows us to derive various transition amplitudes or matrix elements in a sim- ple manner. We can also deﬁne, as before, the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude in the limit of inﬁnite time interval as (see Sec- tion 4.4) Z[J]= ⟨0|0⟩J = N ∫ Dxα e i ℏ S[xα,J α] , (9.5) where in the inﬁnite time interval limit, the action in Eq. (9.5) has the form S[xα,J α]= ∞∫ −∞ dt (L(xα, ˙xα)+ J α(t)xα(t)) , (9.6) and the integration over the paths in Eq. (9.5) has no end point restriction in the sense that the initial and the ﬁnal coordinates of the paths can be chosen arbitrarily. The path integrals can also be extended to continuum ﬁeld the- ories once we recognize that these theories describe physical systems with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. Thus, if φ(x, t)isthe basic variable of a 1 + 1 dimensional ﬁeld theory, then the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude in the presence of an external source can be written as Z[J]= ⟨0|0⟩J = N ∫ Dφe i ℏ S[φ,J] , (9.7) where S[φ, J]= S[φ]+ ∞∫∫ −∞ dt dxJ(x, t)φ(x, t) . (9.8) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 197 9.1 Systems with many degrees of freedom 187 (Incidentally, in all these discussions, we are assuming that the rela- tion between the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian of the system is the canonical one which would lead to path integrals of the form in Eq. (9.5) or (9.7). If this is not the case, then one should take as the starting point, the path integral in the phase space as obtained in Eq. (2.23).) Before going into the discussion about the functional integration in the present case, it is worth emphasizing what we have discussed earlier, namely, it is the time ordered Green’s functions in the vacuum which play the most important role in a ﬁeld theory because the scattering matrix or the S-matrix can be obtained from them. This is why it is the vacuum functional which is the quantity of fundamental signiﬁcance in these studies. The second point to note is that we have left the speciﬁc form of S[φ] arbitrary. Depending on the particular form of the action, we will be dealing with diﬀerent kinds of ﬁeld theories — both non-relativistic and relativistic. Returning now to the question of the functional integration, let us recall that in the 0 + 1 dimensional case, we deﬁned the path integral by dividing the time interval into inﬁnitesimal segments (see Eqs. (2.19) and (2.21)). Here, in addition, we have to divide the space interval into inﬁnitesimal segments as shown in Fig. 9.1. Thus, we assume that − L 2 ≤ x ≤ L 2 , (9.9) with the understanding that we will take the limit L →∞ at the end. We divide the ﬁnite length interval into ¯N equal segments of inﬁnitesimal length ϵ such that ¯Nϵ = L. (9.10) With this, the space-time manifold is divided into inﬁnitesimal cells which we can label with an index “i”. We denote the average value of the ﬁeld variable in the i-th cell of inﬁnitesimal area δAi by φi φi = 1 δAi ∫ δAi dt dxφ(t, x), (9.11) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 198 188 9 Path integral for relativistic theories − L 2 L 2 Figure 9.1: Division of space interval into inﬁnitesimal segments. we can deﬁne the path integral measure as in the case of quantum mechanics (see Eq. (2.30), for example) ∫ Dφ = ∫ ∏ i dφi , (9.12) where the limiting procedures are to be understood. However, unlike the case of 0 + 1 dimensional quantum mechanics, which we have extensively discussed, the path integral, in the present case, does not exist in the sense that the integrations deﬁned in Eq. (9.12) lead to divergences in the continuum limit. However, if we absorb the divergence into the normalization constant N in Eq. (9.5) or (9.7), then the Green’s functions can still be deﬁned uniquely since they are deﬁned as ratios for which the divergent constants simply drop out. For ﬁeld theories in higher dimensions where the basic variables are φ(x,t), we can deﬁne the vacuum generating functional exactly in an analogous manner. Namely, we have Z[J]= ⟨0|0⟩J = N ∫ Dφe i ℏ S[φ,J] , (9.13) where S[φ, J]= S[φ]+ ∫ dnxJ(x,t)φ(x,t) , (9.14) and the integration in Eq. (9.14) is over the entire space-time man- ifold in higher dimension with n denoting the dimensionality of the space-time manifold (this would correspond to a ((n − 1) + 1) di- mensional ﬁeld theory). The functional integral in Eq. (9.13), in January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 199 9.2 Relativistic scalar field theory 189 such a case, is deﬁned by taking a hypercube in n dimensions (the space-time manifold with suitable limiting procedure) divided into a large number of inﬁnitesimal hypercubes and then identifying the functional integral with a product of ordinary integrals of the ﬁeld values at each of the inﬁnitesimal hypercubes (in an averaged sense over the volume of the hypercube as deﬁned in Eq. (9.11)). 9.2 Relativistic scalar ﬁeld theory With all these preliminaries, let us choose a speciﬁc form for the action in Eq. (9.14). Namely, let us choose a relativistic scalar ﬁeld theory in 3 + 1 dimensions described by the Lagrangian density L(φ, ∂μφ)= 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ − m2 2 φ2 − λ 4! φ4 , (9.15) with λ> 0 (this condition merely corresponds to the fact that we would like the potential to be bounded from below in which case the quantum theory will have a meaningful ground state) so that S[φ]= ∫ d4x L(φ, ∂μφ) , (9.16) and S[φ, J]= S[φ]+ ∫ d4xJ(x,t)φ(x,t)= ∫ d4x LJ (φ, ∂μφ) . (9.17) It is worth noting here that the Lagrangian can be obtained from the Lagrangian density in Eq. (9.15) by integrating over the space variables as L = ∫ d3x L(φ, ∂μφ) . (9.18) This theory is quite similar (see Eq. (4.77)) to the anharmonic oscil- lator which we discussed earlier except that it is a relativistic ﬁeld theory invariant under global Poincar´e transformations. This is a self-interacting theory which can describe charge neutral spin zero January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 200 190 9 Path integral for relativistic theories particles of mass m. The Euler-Lagrange equation following from the action in Eq. (9.17) takes the form − δS[φ, J] δφ(x) = ∂μ ∂LJ ∂∂μφ − ∂LJ ∂φ = ∂μ∂μφ + m2φ + λ 3! φ3 − J(x)=0 . (9.19) Here we have chosen to represent the space-time variables in a com- pact notation of x for simplicity. Commonly, this theory described by the action in Eq. (9.17) or by the dynamical equations in Eq. (9.19) is also known as the φ4-theory. In the absence of self-interaction, namely, when λ =0, the action in Eq. (9.17) is at most quadratic in the ﬁeld variables and hence the generating functional can be evaluated in much the same way as in the case of quantum mechanical systems (see Chapters 2, 3 and in particular, Chapter 4). However, let us ﬁrst deﬁne the Feynman Green’s function associated with this theory. The equation satisﬁed by the Green’s function is given by (∂μ∂μ + m2) G(x − x′)= −δ4(x − x′) . (9.20) Deﬁning the Fourier transforms as G(x − x′)= ∫ d4k (2π)4 G(k) e−ik·(x−x′) , δ4(x − x′)= ∫ d4k (2π)4 e−ik·(x−x′) , (9.21) and substituting these back into the diﬀerential equation Eq. (9.20) we obtain 1 (2π)4 (−k2 + m2) G(k)= − 1 (2π)4 or,G(k)= 1 k2 − m2 . (9.22) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 201 9.2 Relativistic scalar field theory 191 Here we are using the scalar product for the four vectors with the metrics introduced in Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4) and k2 = kμkμ represents the invariant length square of the conjugate four vector kμ.The Feynman Green’s function is, then deﬁned following Eq. (3.80) as GF (x − x′) = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ d4k (2π)4 1 k2 − m2 + iϵ e−ik·(x−x′) . (9.23) We can also think of the Feynman Green’s function as satisfying the diﬀerential equation (see Eq. (3.82)) lim ϵ→0+ (∂μ∂μ + m 2 − iϵ) GF (x − x′)= −δ4(x − x′) . (9.24) It is clear from (9.23) that the Feynman Green’s function in this theory is a symmetric function GF (x − x′)= GF (x′ − x). (9.25) Going back to the generating functional in Eq. (9.14), we note that for the present case, if λ = 0, then we can deﬁne Z0[J]= N ∫ Dφe i ℏ S0[x,J] = N ∫ Dφe i ℏ ∫ d4x ( 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ− m2 2 φ2+Jφ) = N ∫ Dφe− i ℏ ∫ d4x ( 1 2 φ(∂μ∂μ+m2)φ−Jφ) , (9.26) with S0[x, J] representing the action Eq. (9.17) with λ = 0. The ﬁeld φ(x,t) is assumed to satisfy the asymptotic condition lim |x|→∞ φ(x,t) → 0 . (9.27) Let us note here once again that the integral in Eq. (9.26) should be properly evaluated by rotating to Euclidean space as discussed in Section 4.1. Alternatively, we can also deﬁne January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 202 192 9 Path integral for relativistic theories Z0[J] = lim ϵ→0+ N ∫ Dφe− i ℏ ∫ d4x ( 1 2 φ(∂μ∂μ+m2−iϵ)φ−Jφ) . (9.28) If we now redeﬁne the variable of integration to be ˜φ(x)= φ(x)+ ∫ d4x′ GF (x − x′)J(x′) , (9.29) with GF deﬁned in Eq. (9.23), then, we obtain lim ϵ→0+ ∫ d4x 1 2 ˜φ(∂μ∂μ + m 2 − iϵ) ˜φ = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ d4x 1 2 (φ(x)+ ∫ d4x′ GF (x − x′)J(x′)) × (∂μ∂μ + m 2 − iϵ) (φ(x)+ ∫ d4x′′ GF (x − x′′)J(x′′)) = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ d4x [ 1 2 φ(x)(∂μ∂μ + m 2 − iϵ)φ(x) − J(x)φ(x) − 1 2 ∫ d4x′ J(x)GF (x − x′)J(x′)] , (9.30) where we have used Eq. (9.24). Substituting Eq. (9.30) back into the generating functional in Eq. (9.28), we obtain (note that the Jacobian for the change of variable in Eq. (9.29) is unity) Z0[J] = lim ϵ→0+ N ∫ Dφe− i ℏ ∫ d4x( 1 2 φ(x)(∂μ∂μ+m2−iϵ)φ(x)−J(x)φ(x)) = lim ϵ→0+ e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x d4x′ J(x)GF (x−x′)J(x′) × N ∫ D ˜φe− i ℏ ∫ d4x 1 2 ˜φ(x)(∂μ∂μ+m2−iϵ) ˜φ(x) = N [det(∂μ∂μ + m2)]− 1 2 × e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x d4x′ J(x)GF (x−x′)J(x′) = Z0[0] e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x d4x′ J(x)GF (x−x′)J(x′) . (9.31) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 203 9.2 Relativistic scalar field theory 193 Here we have used a generalization of the result in Eq. (4.3) for a ﬁeld theory. As in the case of the harmonic oscillator, we note that when λ = 0 (we are calculating the normalized vacuum expectation values below), ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩ = (−iℏ) Z0[J] δZ0[J] δJ(x) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = (−iℏ) Z0[J] (− i ℏ ∫ d4x′ GF (x − x′)J(x′)) Z0[J]∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =0, (9.32) and ⟨0|T (φ(x)φ(y))|0⟩ = (−iℏ)2 Z0[J] δ2Z0[J] δJ(x)δJ(y) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = (−iℏ)2 Z0[J] (− i ℏ GF (x − y)) Z0[J]∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = iℏ GF (x − y) . (9.33) Namely, we obtain once again the familiar result that the Feynman propagator is nothing other than the time ordered two point corre- lation function in the vacuum (see Eq. (4.76)). Just as the path integral for the anharmonic oscillator cannot be evaluated in a closed form, the φ4-theory does not also have a closed form expression for the generating functional. However, we can evaluate it perturbatively at least when the coupling λ is weak (small). We note that we can write (as we had also noted earlier in Eq. (4.83) in the case of the anharmonic oscillator) φ(x) → δ δJ(x) , (9.34) when acting on the action S0[φ, J]. Therefore, we can rewrite the generating functional of Eq. (9.13), in the present case, also as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 204 194 9 Path integral for relativistic theories Z[J]= N ∫ Dφe i ℏ ∫ d4x ( 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ− m2 2 φ2− λ 4! φ4+Jφ) = N ∫ Dφ (e− iλ 4!ℏ ∫ d4xφ4(x)) e i ℏ S0[φ,J] = N ∫ Dφ (e− iλ 4!ℏ ∫ d4x (−iℏ δ δJ(x) )4) e i ℏ S0[φ,J] = (e− iλ 4!ℏ ∫ d4x (−iℏ δ δJ(x) )4) N ∫ Dφe i ℏ S0[φ,J] = (e− iλℏ3 4! ∫ d4x ( δ δJ(x) )4) Z0[J] . (9.35) Once again, we note that this is very analogous to the result obtained in Eq. (4.84) for the anharmonic oscillator. A power series expansion in λ for the generating functional in Eq. (9.35) follows by Taylor expanding the exponential involving the interaction terms. Thus, we have Z[J]= [ 1 − iλℏ3 4! ∫ d4x δ4 δJ 4(x) + 1 2! (− iλℏ3 4! )2 × (∫ d4x δ4 δJ 4(x) )(∫ d4y δ4 δJ 4(y) ) + ··· ] Z0[J] = Z0[0] [ 1 − iλℏ3 4! ∫ d4x δ4 δJ 4(x) + 1 2! (− iλℏ3 4! )2 × (∫ d4x δ4 δJ 4(x) )(∫ d4y δ4 δJ 4(y) ) + ··· ] × e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1 d4x2 J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2) . (9.36) To obtain a feeling for how the actual calculations are carried out, let us derive some of the Green’s functions to low orders in the coupling constant for the φ4-theory. Let us recall from Eq. (4.62) that, by deﬁnition, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 205 9.2 Relativistic scalar field theory 195 ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2) ··· φ(xn))|0⟩ = (−iℏ)n Z[J] δnZ[J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2) ··· δJ(xn) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 . (9.37) Furthermore, from the symmetry of Z[J] in Eqs. (9.31) and (9.35) (namely, from the fact that it is invariant under J ↔−J), we con- clude that the vacuum expectation value of the time ordered product of an odd number of ﬁelds must vanish in this theory. In other words, ⟨0|T (φ(x1) ··· φ(x2n+1))|0⟩ = (−iℏ)2n+1 Z[J] δ2n+1Z[J] δJ(x1) ··· δJ(x2n+1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =0 . (9.38) Consequently, only the even order Green’s functions will be non- trivial in this theory and let us calculate only the 2-point and the 4-point functions up to order λ. Keeping terms up to order λ,we note from Eq. (9.36) that the generating functional takes the form Z[J] ≃ Z0[0] (1 − iλℏ3 4! ∫ d4x δ4 δJ 4(x) ) × e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2) . (9.39) To evaluate this, let us note that δ2 δJ 2(x) e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2 J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2) = δ δJ(x) [ − i ℏ (∫ d4x3GF (x − x3)J(x3)) × e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2)] January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 206 196 9 Path integral for relativistic theories = [− i ℏ GF (0) − 1 ℏ2 (∫ d4x3GF (x − x3)J(x3) )(∫ d4x4GF (x − x4)J(x4) )] × e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2) . (9.40) With some algebraic manipulations this, then, leads to the result ∫ d4x δ4 δJ 4(x) e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2) = ∫ d4x δ2 δJ 2(x) ( δ2 δJ 2(x) e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2)) = ∫ d4x [− 3 ℏ2 GF (0)GF (0) + 6i ℏ3 GF (0) (∫ d4x3GF (x − x3)J(x3)) × (∫ d4x4GF (x − x4)J(x4)) + 1 ℏ4 (∫ d4x3GF (x − x3)J(x3))(∫ d4x4GF (x − x4)J(x4) ) × (∫ d4x5GF (x − x5)J(x5))(∫ d4x6GF (x − x6)J(x6))] × e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2) . (9.41) Putting this back into Eq. (9.39), we obtain the generating func- tional to linear power in λ to be Z[J]= Z0[0] [1+ iλℏ 8 GF (0)GF (0) ∫ d4x + λ 4 GF (0) ∫ d4x (∫ d4x3GF (x − x3)J(x3)) × (∫ d4x4GF (x − x4)J(x4)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 207 9.2 Relativistic scalar field theory 197 − iλ 4!ℏ ∫ d4x (∫ d4x3GF (x − x3)J(x3)) × (∫ d4x4GF (x − x4)J(x4)) × (∫ d4x5GF (x − x5)J(x5) )(∫ d4x6GF (x − x6)J(x6) )] × e− i 2ℏ ∫∫ d4x1d4x2J(x1)GF (x1−x2)J(x2) . (9.42) It now follows that Z[0] = Z0[0] (1+ iλℏ 8 GF (0)GF (0) ∫ d4x) . (9.43) This is clearly divergent (both the space-time volume as well as the Green’s function at vanishing arguments are divergent) and as we have argued earlier, the divergence can be absorbed into the normal- ization constant. We recall that by deﬁnition, the time ordered two point function (in vacuum) is given by ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩ = (−iℏ)2 Z[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 , (9.44) and from Eq. (9.42) we note that to linear order in λ we have δ2Z[J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = Z0[0] [(1+ iλℏ 8 GF (0)GF (0) ∫ d4x)( − i ℏ GF (x1 − x2)) + λ 2 GF (0) ∫ d4xGF (x − x1)GF (x − x2)] . (9.45) Therefore, to linear order in λ, we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 208 198 9 Path integral for relativistic theories ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩ = (−iℏ)2 Z[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = − ℏ2 Z0[0] (1 + iλℏ 8 GF (0)GF (0) ∫ d4x) × Z0[0] [(1+ iλℏ 8 GF (0)GF (0) ∫ d4x)(− i ℏ GF (x1 − x2)) + λ 2 GF (0) ∫ d4xGF (x − x1)GF (x − x2)] ≃−ℏ2 [− i ℏ GF (x1 − x2) + λ 2 GF (0) ∫ d4xGF (x − x1)GF (x − x2)] = iℏGF (x1 − x2) − λℏ2 2 GF (0) ∫ d4xGF (x − x1)GF (x − x2). (9.46) Here in the second term, we have only kept the leading order term (which is unity) coming from the expansion of the denominator since we are interested in the 2-point function up to order λ. We note that the ﬁrst term is, of course, the Feynman propagator for the free theory deﬁned in Eq. (9.23). The second term, on the other hand, is a ﬁrst order quantum correction to the propagator. It is worth pointing out here that GF (0)isadivergentquantityaswecan readily check from the form of the Green’s function in Eq. (9.23). Thus, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst order correction to the propagator in this theory is divergent. This is, indeed, a general feature of quantum ﬁeld theories, namely, the quantum corrections in a ﬁeld theory lead to divergences which are then taken care of by a procedure known as renormalization. Next, let us calculate the 4-point function up to order λ.To leading order, we note from Eq. (9.42) that δ4Z[J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2)δJ(x3)δJ(x4) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 209 9.2 Relativistic scalar field theory 199 = Z0[0] [− 1 ℏ2 ( 1+ iλℏ 8 GF (0)GF (0) ∫ d4x ) × (GF (x1 − x2)GF (x3 − x4) + GF (x1 − x3)GF (x2 − x4)+ GF (x1 − x4)GF (x2 − x3) ) − iλ 2ℏ GF (0) ∫ d4x{GF (x1 − x2)GF (x − x3)GF (x − x4) + GF (x1 − x3)GF (x − x2)GF (x − x4) + GF (x1 − x4)GF (x − x2)GF (x − x3) + GF (x2 − x3)GF (x − x1)GF (x − x4) + GF (x2 − x4)GF (x − x1)GF (x − x3) + GF (x3 − x4)GF (x − x1)GF (x − x2)} − iλ ℏ ∫ d4xGF (x − x1)GF (x − x2)GF (x − x3)GF (x − x4)]. (9.47) Substituting this back into the deﬁnition of the 4-point function in Eq. (9.37)and keeping terms only up to order λ, we obtain ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2)φ(x3)φ(x4))|0⟩ = (−iℏ)4 Z[J] δ4Z[J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2)δJ(x3)δJ(x4) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = −ℏ2(GF (x1 − x2)GF (x3 − x4)+ GF (x1 − x3)GF (x2 − x4) + GF (x1 − x4)GF (x2 − x3)) − iλℏ3 2 GF (0) ∫ d4x(GF (x1 − x2)GF (x − x3)GF (x − x4) + GF (x1 − x3)GF (x − x2)GF (x − x4) + GF (x1 − x4)GF (x − x2)GF (x − x3) + GF (x2 − x3)GF (x − x1)GF (x − x4) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 210 200 9 Path integral for relativistic theories + GF (x2 − x4)GF (x − x1)GF (x − x3) + GF (x3 − x4)GF (x − x1)GF (x − x2)) − iλℏ3 ∫ d4xGF (x − x1)GF (x − x2)GF (x − x3)GF (x − x4). (9.48) 9.3 Feynman rules These lowest order calculations are suﬃcient to convince anyone in- terested in the subject that a systematic procedure needs to be de- veloped to keep track of the perturbative expansion. The Feynman rules do precisely this. Let us note that the basic elements in our φ4-theory are the Feynman propagator for the free theory and the interaction. Let us represent them diagrammatically as x1 x2 = iℏ GF (x1 − x2) , x1 x4 x2 x3 = V (x1,x2,x3,x4) = i ℏ δ4S[φ] δφ(x1)δφ(x2)δφ(x3)δφ(x4) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φ=0 = − iλ ℏ ∫ d4xδ(x − x1)δ(x − x2)δ(x − x3)δ(x − x4). (9.49) The interaction vertex is understood to be the part of the graph without the external lines or the propagators (the delta functions make this explicit). It is clear that given these basic elements, we can construct various nontrivial graphs by joining the vertex to the propagators. Let us further use the rule that in evaluating such graphs, we integrate over the intermediate points (coordinates) where a vertex connects with the propagators. With these rules, then, we can obtain the value for the following simple diagram to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 211 9.3 Feynman rules 201 x1 x2y1 y2 y3 y4 = ∫ d4y1d4y2d4y3d4y4 iℏGF (x1 − y1)iℏGF (y2 − x2) × iℏGF (y3 − y4)V (y1,y2,y3,y4) =(iℏ)3 ∫ d4yd4y1d4y2d4y3d4y4GF (x1 − y1)GF (y2 − x2) × GF (y3 − y4)( − iλ ℏ δ(y − y1)δ(y − y2)δ(y − y3)δ(y − y4) ) = −λℏ2GF (0) ∫ d4yGF (x1 − y)GF (y − x2) . (9.50) There is one ﬁnal rule. Namely, if the internal part of a diagram has a symmetry, then the true value of the diagram is obtained by dividing with this symmetry factor. For the present case, the internal bubble diagram in Eq. (9.50) is invariant under a rotation by 180◦ (namely, under y3 ↔ y4). The symmetry factor, in this case, is 21 = 2. (The symmetry factor for a nontrivial Feynman diagram is the most diﬃcult to determine by naive inspection of the diagram and should be obtained through a careful evaluation of the functional derivation (see, for example, Eq. (9.46)), or when necessary going back to Wick’s expansion of quantum ﬁeld theory.) Dividing by the symmetry factor, we obtain the value of this diagram to be x1 x2 = − λℏ2 2 GF (0) ∫ d4xGF (x1 −x)GF (x−x2) , (9.51) which we recognize to be the ﬁrst order (linear in λ) correction to the propagator in Eq. (9.46) (note that for the scalar theory GF (x − y)= GF (y − x)). Each such diagram that can be constructed from the basic el- ements in Eq. (9.49) is known as a Feynman diagram of the theory and corresponds to a particular term in the perturbative expansion of the amplitudes (Green’s functions). Thus, for example, we now January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 212 202 9 Path integral for relativistic theories immediately recognize from Eqs. (9.46) and (9.48) that up to order λ, we can write ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩ = x1 x2 + x1 x2 , ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2)φ(x3)φ(x4))|0⟩ = x1 x2 x3 x4 + x1 x3 x2 x4 + x1 x4 x2 x3 + x3 x4 x1 x2 + x2 x4 x1 x3 + x2 x3 x1 x4 + x1 x4 x2 x3 + x1 x3 x2 x4 + x1 x2 x3 x4 + x1 x4 x2 x3 . (9.52) 9.4 Connected diagrams The Feynman diagrams, as can be seen from Eq. (9.52), clearly con- sist of two classes of diagrams, one where each part of the diagram is connected to the rest of the diagram and another where parts of the diagram are disconnected from the rest. The Feynman dia- grams, which consist of parts that are not connected to one another, are known as disconnected Feynman diagrams. It is clear from the above simple examples that the generating functional Z[J] generates Green’s functions which contain disconnected diagrams as well as connected ones. As we have discussed earlier (see the discussion fol- lowing Eq. (4.63)), the logarithm of Z[J] generates Green’s functions which describe only the connected matrix elements (also known as the connected Green’s functions) and these give rise to the physical scattering matrix elements. Namely, W [J]= −iℏ ln Z[J] , (9.53) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 213 9.4 Connected diagrams 203 generates connected Green’s functions. We note from Eqs. (9.53), (9.37) and (9.38) that δW [J] δJ(x1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = (−iℏ) Z[J] δZ[J] δJ(x1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = ⟨0|φ(x1)|0⟩. (9.54) Similarly, for the two point function, we obtain −iℏ δ2W [J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 =(−iℏ)2 [ 1 Z[J] δ2Z[J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2) − 1 Z2[J] δZ[J] δJ(x1) δZ[J] δJ(x2) ]∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩−⟨0|φ(x1)|0⟩⟨0|φ(x2)|0⟩ = ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩c . (9.55) In a similar manner, with some algebra, it can be shown that (−iℏ)2 δ3W [J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2)δJ(x3) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2)φ(x3))|0⟩−⟨0|φ(x1)|0⟩⟨0|T (φ(x2)φ(x3))|0⟩ −⟨0|φ(x2)|0⟩⟨0|T (φ(x3)φ(x1))|0⟩ −⟨0|φ(x3)|0⟩⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩ +2⟨0|φ(x1)|0⟩⟨0|φ(x2)|0⟩⟨0|φ(x3)|0⟩ = ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2)φ(x3)|0⟩c , (9.56) and so on. In general, the connected n-point Green’s function is given by ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2) ··· φ(xn))|0⟩c =(−iℏ)n−1 δnW [J] δJ(x1)δJ(x2) ··· δJ(xn) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣J=0. (9.57) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 214 204 9 Path integral for relativistic theories We can, of course, check explicitly that the connected Green’s functions involve only connected Feynman diagrams as follows. Note that for the φ4-theory, as we have discussed earlier in Eq. (9.38) ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩ =0 . (9.58) Consequently, up to order λ we note from Eq. (9.55) that ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩ = ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩c = x1 x2 + x1 x2 . (9.59) Similarly, for the 4-point function, we have ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2)φ(x3)φ(x4))|0⟩c = ⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2)φ(x3)φ(x4))|0⟩ −⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x2))|0⟩⟨0|T (φ(x3)φ(x4))|0⟩ −⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x3))|0⟩⟨0|T (φ(x2)φ(x4))|0⟩ −⟨0|T (φ(x1)φ(x4))|0⟩⟨0|T (φ(x2)φ(x3))|0⟩ = x1 x4 x2 x3 . (9.60) Thus, we see that W [J] indeed generates connected Green’s functions (given by connected Feynman diagrams). Given this, we can write down the diagrammatic expansion of the connected 2-point Green’s function up to order λ2 in this theory simply as x1 x2 = x1 x2 + x1 x2 + x1 x2 + x1 x2 + x1 x2.

Note that while W [J] generates connected diagrams, it con- tains diagrams that are reducible to two connected diagrams upon cutting a single internal line (propagator). Thus, in the 2-point func- tion represented in Eq. (9.61), the third graph is reducible upon cutting the internal propagator connecting the two bubbles. Such diagrams are called 1P (one particle) reducible. It is clear that the 1P irreducible diagrams are in some sense more fundamental since we can construct all the connected diagrams from them. We will take up the study of the 1PI (one particle irreducible) diagrams in the next chapter. 9.5 References A. Das, Lectures on Quantum Field Theory, World Scientiﬁc Pub- lishing. K.

We note that the one point function in the presence of an external source is given by δW [J] δJ(x) = (−iℏ) Z[J] δZ[J] δJ(x) = ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩J . (10.2) For the φ4-theory, we have seen in Eq. (9.38) that the vacuum expec- tation value of the ﬁeld operator vanishes in the absence of external sources (namely, when J = 0). In general, however, let us note that we can write ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩ = ⟨0|e i ℏ P ·xφ(0)e− i ℏ P ·x|0⟩ , (10.3) wherewehaveidentiﬁed e− i ℏ P ·x with the operator for space-time translations (Pμ corresponds to the generator of inﬁnitesimal trans- lations in quantum ﬁeld theory). Assuming that the vacuum state in our Hilbert space is unique and that it is Poincar´e invariant in the absence of sources, namely, that it satisﬁes e− i ℏ P ·a|0⟩ = |0⟩ , or,Pμ|0⟩ =0 , (10.4) 207 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 218 208 10 Effective action we obtain from Eqs. (10.3) and (10.4) that ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩ = ⟨0|φ(0)|0⟩ = constant . (10.5) Thus, from symmetry arguments alone, we conclude that the one point function can, in general, be a constant independent of space- time coordinates when sources are not present. For the φ4-theory, this constant coincides with zero, namely, we have ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩ =0 . (10.6) The value of the one point function is quite important in the study of symmetries. As we will see later, a nonvanishing value of this quantity signals the spontaneous breakdown of some symmetry in the theory. In the presence of an external source, however, the vacuum ex- pectation value of the ﬁeld operator becomes a functional of the source and need not be a constant. Let us denote this by δW [J] δJ(x) = (−iℏ) Z[J] δZ[J] δJ(x) = ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩J = φc(x) , (10.7) and it is clear from Eq. (10.7) that it is indeed a functional of the external source. The ﬁeld φc(x) which is only a classical variable is known as the classical ﬁeld. To understand the meaning of the classical ﬁeld as well as the reason for its name, let us analyze the generating functional in Eq. (10.1) Z[J]= N ∫ Dφe i ℏ S[φ,J] , (10.8) in some detail. Since Z[J] is independent of φ(x), an arbitrary, in- ﬁnitesimal change in φ(x)(φ(x) → φ(x)+ δφ(x)) in the integrand on the right hand side will leave the generating functional invariant. Namely, under such a change, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 219 10.1 The classical field 209 δZ[J]= N ∫ Dφ i ℏ δS[φ, J]e i ℏ S[φ,J] = iN ℏ ∫ Dφ (∫ d4xδφ(x) δS[φ, J] δφ(x) ) e i ℏ S[φ,J] =0 . (10.9) Here we are assuming that the functional integration measure in Eq. (10.8) does not change under the redeﬁnition of the ﬁeld variable. (If it does change, then we will have an additional term coming from the change in the measure (Jacobian). Such a term plays an impor- tant role in the study of anomalies.) Since the relation in Eq. (10.9) must be true for any arbitrary inﬁnitesimal variation δφ(x)ofthe ﬁeld variable, it now follows that we must have N ∫ Dφ δS[φ, J] δφ(x) e i ℏ S[φ,J] =0 . (10.10) This merely expresses what we already know from the study of quan- tum mechanics. Namely, that the Euler-Lagrange equations of a the- ory hold only as an expectation value equation (Ehrenfest’s theorem) in a quantum theory, or more explicitly, 〈0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ δS[φ, J] δφ(x) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 0〉J =0 . (10.11) The Euler-Lagrange equation (the classical equation) has the generic form (see, for example, Eq. (9.8) or (9.17)) − δS[φ, J] δφ(x) = F (φ(x)) − J(x)=0 , (10.12) where the quantity F (φ(x)) depends on the speciﬁc dynamics of the system and for the φ4-theory, we note from Eq. (9.15) that it has the particular form F (φ(x)) ≡− δS[φ] δφ(x) =(∂μ∂μ + m2)φ(x)+ λ 3! φ3(x) . (10.13) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 220 210 10 Effective action Using Eq. (10.12) in Eq. (10.10), then, we obtain − N ∫ Dφ δS[φ, J] δφ(x) e i ℏ S[φ,J] = N ∫ Dφ (F (φ(x)) − J(x)) e i ℏ S[φ,J] =0 . (10.14) Let us recall that −iℏ δZ[J] δJ(x) = N ∫ Dφ δS[φ, J] δJ(x) e i ℏ S[φ,J] = N ∫ Dφφ(x) e i ℏ S[φ,J], (10.15) whichallowsustomakethe identiﬁcation φ(x) →−iℏ δ δJ(x) , (10.16) in the sense that a factor of φ(x) inside the path integral is equivalent to (−iℏ δ δJ(x) )actingon Z[J]. Using this, we can write Eq. (10.14) also as [F (−iℏ δ δJ(x) ) − J(x)] Z[J]=0, or, [F (−iℏ δ δJ(x) ) − J(x)] e i ℏ W [J] =0, or,e− i ℏ W [J] [F (−iℏ δ δJ(x) ) − J(x)] e i ℏ W [J] =0, or, [F ( δW [J] δJ(x) − iℏ δ δJ(x) ) − J(x)] 1=0, or,F (φc(x) − iℏ δ δJ(x) ) 1 − J(x)=0 . (10.17) Here we have made it explicit that any free operator ( δ δJ(x) )onthe left hand side acts on 1. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 221 10.1 The classical field 211 This is the full dynamical equation of the theory at the quantum level. It is quite diﬀerent from the classical Euler-Lagrange equation in Eq. (10.12). But let us note that in the limit ℏ → 0, the complete equation in Eq. (10.17) reduces to the form F (φc(x)) − J(x)=0 , (10.18) which is the familiar classical Euler-Lagrange equation in Eq. (10.12). It is for this reason that φc(x) is called the classical ﬁeld. To get a better feeling for the quantum equation in Eq. (10.17) as well as Eq. (10.18) in the ℏ → 0 limit, let us consider speciﬁcally the φ4- theory. In this case, as we have noted earlier in Eq. (10.13), the classical Euler-Lagrange equation is given by F (φ(x))−J(x)=(∂μ∂μ +m2)φ(x)+ λ 3! φ3(x)−J(x)=0 . (10.19) Consequently, the quantum equation takes the form F (φc(x) − iℏ δ δJ(x) ) − J(x)=0, or, (∂μ∂μ + m 2) (φc(x) − iℏ δ δJ(x) ) + λ 3! (φc(x) − iℏ δ δJ(x) )3 − J(x)=0, or, (∂μ∂μ + m 2)φc(x)+ λ 3! φ3 c(x) − J(x) − iλℏ 2! φc(x) δφc(x) δJ(x) − λℏ2 3! δ2φc(x) δJ(x)δJ(x) =0 . (10.20) In terms of W [J], this can also be written as (∂μ∂μ + m 2) δW [J] δJ(x) + λ 3! ( δW [J] δJ(x) )3 − J(x) − iλℏ 2! δW [J] δJ(x) δ2W [J] δJ 2(x) − λℏ2 3! δ3W [J] δJ 3(x) =0 . (10.21) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 222 212 10 Effective action We can think of Eq. (10.21) as the master equation governing the full dynamics of the quantum theory. By taking higher functional deriva- tives of (10.21), we can determine the dynamical equations satisﬁed by various connected Green’s functions of the theory. These equa- tions are known as the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Bethe- Salpeter equations are special cases of these equations. We should note here that in a quantum ﬁeld theory whenever there are products of operators at the same space-time point, the corresponding Green’s functions become ill deﬁned and have to be regularized (deﬁned) in some manner. The manifestation of this problem is quite clear in Eq. (10.21). The quantum dynamical equation involves second and third functional derivatives of W [J] at the same space-time point which are not at all well deﬁned. One needs to develop a systematic regularization procedure to handle these diﬃculties. The discussion of these topics lies outside the scope of these lectures. On the other hand, let us note that in the limit ℏ → 0, all such ill deﬁned terms vanish and we have from Eq. (10.20) (∂μ∂μ + m 2)φc(x)+ λ 3! φ3 c(x) − J(x)=0 , (10.22) which is the classical Euler-Lagrange equation. Furthermore, let us note that we can solve this equation iteratively through the use of the propagator (Green’s function) deﬁned in Eqs. (9.23) and (9.24) as follows. First, we note that the solution for φc(x) can be written as an integral equation φc(x)= ∫ d4x1 GF (x − x1) (−J(x1)+ λ 3! φ3 c(x1)) = − ∫ d4x1GF (x − x1)J(x1)+ λ 3! ∫ d4x1 GF (x − x1)φ3 c(x1) , (10.23) which can be solved iteratively. The iterative solution has the form φc(x) ≃− ∫ d4x1 GF (x − x1)J(x1)+ λ 3! ∫ d4x1GF (x − x1) × (∫ d4x2GF (x1 − x2) (−J(x2)+ λ 3! φ3 c(x2)))3 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 223 10.2 Effective action 213 = −∫ d4x1GF (x − x1)J(x1) − λ 3! ∫ d4x1d4x2d4x3d4x4GF (x − x1) × GF (x1 − x2)GF (x1 − x3)GF (x1 − x4)J(x2)J(x3)J(x4)+ ··· (10.24) We can diagrammatically represent this iterative solution if we intro- duce a vertex describing the interaction of the ﬁeld with the external source as x = i ℏ δS[φ, J] δφ(x) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φ=0 = i ℏ J(x) . (10.25) In this case, the iterative solution for the classical ﬁeld can be written diagrammatically as φc(x)= x + 1 3! x + 1 2!3! x + ··· . (10.26) In other words, the classical ﬁeld in the limit ℏ → 0 generates all the tree diagrams or the Born diagrams of the theory. It is, therefore, also known as the Born functional or the generating functional for tree diagrams. The combinatoric factors cancel out when taking functional derivatives of φc with respect to sources yielding the tree level n-point amplitudes. 10.2 Eﬀective action The classical ﬁeld, as we have seen in Eq. (10.7), is deﬁned as δW [J] δJ(x) = φc(x) . (10.27) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 224 214 10 Effective action This relation indicates that the variables J(x)and φc(x)are in some sense conjugate variables. As we have argued earlier, the classical ﬁeld is a functional of the source J(x). However, we can also invert the deﬁning relation for the classical ﬁeld and solve for the source J(x) as a functional of φc(x)atleast perturbatively. Infact, letus deﬁne a new functional through a Legendre transformation as Γ[φc]= W [J] − ∫ d4xJ(x)φc(x) . (10.28) It is clear, then, that δΓ[φc] δφc(x) = δW [J] δφc(x) − ∫ d4y δJ(y) δφc(x) φc(y) − J(x) = ∫ d4y δW [J] δJ(y) δJ(y) δφc(x) − ∫ d4y δJ(y) δφc(x) δW [J] δJ(y) − J(x), or, δΓ[φc] δφc(x) = −J(x) . (10.29) In this derivation, we have used the chain rule for functional deriva- tives as well as the deﬁnition of the classical ﬁeld. We note that Eq. (10.29) indeed deﬁnes the source as a functional of the classi- cal ﬁeld and has the same structure as the classical Euler-Lagrange equation for a system in the presence of an external source. Let us re- call from Eqs. (10.12) and (10.13) that the tree level Euler-Lagrange equation is given by δS[φ] δφ(x) = −J(x) . (10.30) It is for this reason that Γ[φc] is also known as the eﬀective action functional for the theory (which includes all the quantum correc- tions). Note that as we have discussed earlier in Eq. (10.5), when J → 0,φc(x) → constant. (10.31) In the framework of the eﬀective action, we see from Eq. (10.29) that the value of this constant is determined from the equation January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 225 10.2 Effective action 215 δΓ[φc] δφc(x) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φc(x)=const. =0 . (10.32) This is an extremum equation which is much easier to analyze in order to determine whether a symmetry is spontaneously broken. To understand the meaning of this new functional Γ[φc], let us note that if we treat φc(x) as our independent variable, then we can write δ δJ(x) = ∫ d4y δφc(y) δJ(x) δ δφc(y) = ∫ d4y δ2W [J] δJ(x)δJ(y) δ δφc(y) . (10.33) Using this in Eq. (10.29) we obtain δ δJ(y) ( δΓ[φc] δφc(x) ) = −δ4(x − y), or, ∫ d4z δ2W [J] δJ(y)δJ(z) δ2Γ[φc] δφc(z)δφc(x) = −δ4(x − y) . (10.34) Introducing the compact notation W (n) = δnW [J] δJ(x1) ··· δJ(xn) , Γ (n) = δnΓ[φc] δφc(x1) ··· δφc(xn) , (10.35) we can write Eq. (10.34) also in the compact form (we can view this as an operator relation where the appropriate coordinate dependencies arise by taking matrix elements in the coordinate basis) W (2)Γ (2) = −1 . (10.36) We recall from Eqs. (9.33) and (9.55) that the full Feynman Green’s function of the interacting theory is deﬁned to be (we reserve the notation GF for the free Feynman Green’s function for simplicity) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 226 216 10 Effective action W (2)∣ ∣ ∣J=0 = −G. (10.37) Furthermore, recalling that when J =0, φc(x)= φc = constant, we have from Eqs. (10.36) and (10.37) W (2)∣ ∣ ∣J=0 Γ(2)∣ ∣ ∣φc = −1, or,GΓ(2)∣ ∣ ∣φc =1 . (10.38) In other words, Γ(2)∣ ∣φc corresponds to the inverse of the propagator at every order of the perturbation theory. Thus, writing Γ (2)∣ ∣ ∣φc =Γ (2) 0 − Σ= G−1 F − Σ , (10.39) where Γ (2) 0 corresponds to the tree level (free) 2-point (vertex) func- tion and Σ, known as the self-energy, denotes the quantum correc- tions in Γ(2)∣ ∣φc (to any order), we have from Eq. (10.38) G(G−1 F − Σ) = 1, or,G = 1 G−1 F − Σ = 1 G−1 F + 1 G−1 F Σ 1 G−1 F + 1 G−1 F Σ 1 G−1 F Σ 1 G−1 F + ··· = GF + GF ΣGF + GF ΣGF ΣGF + ··· . (10.40) (Equation (10.40) describes a form of what is known as the Lippmann- Schwinger equation.) Introducing the diagrammatic representation − i ℏ Σ= , (10.41) we have the diagrammatic relation for the complete propagator of the theory as (recall that the propagator is given by iℏ times the Green’s function) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 227 10.2 Effective action 217 = xy + xy + xy + ··· . (10.42) It is clear from this relation that Σ is nothing other than the 1P irreducible (1PI) 2-point vertex function. It is also known as the proper self energy for the given theory. Given the relation in Eq. (10.34) ∫ d4z δ2W [J] δJ(y)δJ(z) δ2Γ[φc] δφc(z)δφc(x) = −δ4(x − y) , (10.43) we can diﬀerentiate this with respect to δ δJ(w) to obtain (with the use of Eq. (10.33)) ∫ d4z δ3W [J] δJ(w)δJ(y)δJ(z) δ2Γ[φc] δφc(z)δφc(x) (10.44) = − ∫ d4zd4σ δ2W [J] δJ(y)δJ(z) δ3Γ[φc] δφc(z)δφc(x)δφc(σ) δ2W [J] δJ(σ)δJ(w) . Recalling that W (2)Γ (2) = −1 , (10.45) we can also rewrite this equation as δ3W [J] δJ(x)δJ(y)δJ(z) = ∫ d4x′d4y′d4z′ δ2W [J] δJ(x)δJ(x′) δ2W [J] δJ(y)δJ(y′) δ2W [J] δJ(z)δJ(z′) × δ3Γ[φc] δφc(x′)δφc(y′)δφc(z′) . (10.46) In compact notation, we can write this equation also as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 228 218 10 Effective action W (3) = W (2)W (2)W (2)Γ (3) . (10.47) Furthermore, introducing the diagrammatic representations (recall the deﬁnition of connected Green’s functions from (9.57)), xy =(−iℏ) W (2)(x, y) ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 , x y z =(−iℏ) 2 W (3)(x, y, z) ∣ ∣ ∣J=0 , x y z = i ℏ Γ(3)(x, y, z) ∣ ∣ ∣φc , (10.48) we note that Eq. (10.46) or (10.47) can also be diagrammatically represented as (when J = 0 and φc(x)= φc = constant) x y z = z x y . (10.49) This shows that Γ(3)∣ ∣φc gives the proper 3-point vertex function (in other words, it is 1PI). A similar calculation for the 4-point connected Green’s function leads to the diagrammatic relation January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 229 10.2 Effective action 219 x y w z = x w y z + x y w z + permutations. (10.50) Thus, we see that we can expand the eﬀective action functional as Γ[φc]= ∞∑ n=1 ∫ d4x1 ··· d4xn 1 n! Γ(n)(x1, ··· ,xn)∣ ∣ ∣φc φc(x1) ··· φc(xn), (10.51) where (in the above expansion we are expanding around φc =0 which we assume to be the solution of Eq. (10.32)) Γ (n)(x1, ··· ,xn)∣ ∣ ∣φc =Γ(n)(x1, ··· ,xn)∣ ∣ ∣φc=0 , (10.52) is the proper (1PI) n-point vertex function of the theory. It is for this reason that Γ[φc] is known as the 1PI generating functional. Let us note here that the 1PI vertex functions with suitable external wave functions lead to the scattering matrix elements of the theory. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 230 220 10 Effective action Since Γ[φc] is an eﬀective action, it can also be expanded alter- natively in powers of the derivative or momentum like the classical action. Thus, since the tree level action has the form S[φ]= ∫ d4x ( 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ − m2 2 φ2 − λ 4! φ4) = ∫ d4x ( 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ − V (φ)) , (10.53) we expect to be able to write Γ[φc] also in the form Γ[φc]= ∫ d4x (−Veﬀ (φc(x)) + 1 2 A(φc(x))∂μφc(x)∂μφc(x)+ ··· ) , (10.54) where the terms neglected are higher order in the derivatives. Let us recall that when the sources are set equal to zero, then the classical ﬁeld takes a constant value φc(x)= φc. In this limit all the derivative terms in the expansion in Eq. (10.54) vanish, leading to Γ[φc]= − ∫ d4xVeﬀ (φc)= −Veﬀ (φc) ∫ d4x. (10.55) In other words, in this limit, the eﬀective action simply picks out the eﬀective potential including quantum corrections to all orders. The quantity ∫ d4x which represents the space-time volume is con- ventionally also written as ∫ d4x =(2π)4δ4(0) . (10.56) Let us also note that the constant value of φc = ⟨φ⟩ when the sources are turned oﬀ is obtained from the extremum equation in Eq. (10.32) δΓ[φc] δφc(x) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φc(x)=φc =0 . (10.57) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 231 10.3 Loop expansion 221 In terms of the eﬀective potential, this condition becomes equivalent to ∂Veﬀ (φc) ∂φc ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φc=⟨φ⟩ =0 , (10.58) which is the familiar extremization condition from the study of clas- sical mechanics. Note here that since φc is an ordinary variable (namely, it does not depend on space-time coordinates), only ordi- nary partial derivatives are involved in the above extremum condi- tion. In this sense, this equation is much easier to analyze than a functional equation. We also note that the renormalized values of the masses and the coupling constants (including all quantum cor- rections) can be obtained (in this theory) from the eﬀective potential simply as ∂2Veﬀ ∂φ2 c ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φc=⟨φ⟩ = m2 R , ∂4Veﬀ ∂φ4 c ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φc=⟨φ⟩ = λR . (10.59) The study of the eﬀective potential is, therefore, quite important. It is particularly useful in analyzing when the quantum corrections can change the qualitative tree level behavior or the classical behavior of atheory. 10.3 Loop expansion We have already described the Feynman rules in the coordinate space. However, for most practical calculations it is quite useful to work in the momentum space. Given the Feynman rules in the coordinate space, these rules can be readily generalized to the mo- mentum space. (This simply involves taking Fourier transforms.) For the φ4 theory, for example, the momentum space Feynman rules take the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 232 222 10 Effective action p = iℏGF (p) = lim ϵ→0 iℏ p2 − m2 + iϵ , p1 p4 p2 p3 = − iλ ℏ δ4(p1 + p2 + p3 + p4) , (10.60) where all momenta at the vertex are assumed to be incoming. In evaluating a Feynman diagram, we should integrate over each of the intermediate momenta, namely, the momenta of the internal propa- gators (with the normalization factor 1 (2π)4 ). Thus, for example, let us evaluate the 1PI 2-point vertex function at order λ I = p1 p2 k . (10.61) According to our rules, we obtain I = 1 2 (− iλ ℏ ) ∫ d4k (2π)4 iℏ k2 − m2 δ4(p1 − p2 + k − k) = λ 2 δ4(p1 − p2) ∫ d4k (2π)4 1 k2 − m2 . (10.62) Note that the factor of 1 2 in front of the integral in Eq. (10.62) sim- ply corresponds to the symmetry factor of the diagram which we discussed earlier. In writing the propagator, we have not explicitly included the iϵ term although it should always be kept in mind in evaluating the integral. We will discuss the actual evaluation of the integrals later. For the present, let us simply note that the calcula- tions indeed take a simpler form in the momentum space. Let us next recognize from the form of the exponent in the path integral that the quantity which determines the dynamics of the system is January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 233 10.3 Loop expansion 223 1 ℏ L(φ, ∂μφ)= 1 ℏ ( 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ − m2 2 φ2 − λ 4! φ4) . (10.63) The Planck’s constant which measures the quantum nature of an am- plitude comes as a multiplicative factor in the exponent. As we have seen in Eqs. (9.49) and (10.60), the consequence of this is that each vertex has a factor of 1 ℏ associated with it. On the other hand, the propagator which is the inverse of the operator in the quadratic part of the Lagrangian (two point function), comes multiplied with a fac- tor of ℏ. Thus, suppose we are considering a proper vertex diagram (1PI diagram) with V vertices and I internal lines or propagators, then the total number of ℏ factors associated with such a diagram is given by P = I − V. (10.64) In other words, such a diagram will behave like ∼ ℏP . Let us also calculate the number of independent momentum in- tegrations associated with such a diagram. First, let us note that in a proper vertex diagram, there are no external propagators or legs. Second, the momenta associated with each of the internal lines must be integrated. Since there are I internal lines, there will, therefore, be I momentum integrations. Of course, not all such momenta will be independent since at each vertex there is a momentum conserving δ- function. Each such δ-function will reduce the number of momentum integration by one. Since there are V vertices, there will be as many momentum conserving δ-functions. However, we will need to have an overall momentum conserving δ-function for the amplitude (vertex). Hence, the δ-functions will eﬀectively reduce the number of momen- tum integrations by V − 1. Therefore, the number of independent internal momentum integrations associated with the diagram will be given by L = I − (V − 1) = I − V +1 = P +1 . (10.65) But the number of independent momentum integrations precisely deﬁnes the number of loops in a diagram and from the above relation January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 234 224 10 Effective action we note that the number of loops associated with a diagram is related to the power of ℏ associated with a diagram. In fact, the number of loops exceeds the power of ℏ by one. (An amplitude with L loops goes as ∼ ℏL−1.) Therefore, expanding an amplitude in powers of ℏ is also equivalent to an expansion in the number of loops. The loop expansion provides a valid perturbative expansion sim- ply because ℏ is a small quantity. (We have already introduced the concept of such an expansion in powers of ℏ in discussing the WKB approximation.) This expansion is quite useful and is very diﬀer- ent from expanding in powers of the coupling constant. This follows mainly from the fact that the expansion parameter ℏ multiplies the entire Lagrangian density (action). Consequently, such an expansion is insensitive to how we divide the Lagrangian density into a free part and an interaction part. The loop expansion is, therefore, unaﬀected by any such separation. This is particularly useful if the theory ex- hibits spontaneous symmetry breakdown in which case, as we will see later, the vacuum expectation value φc = ⟨φ⟩ becomes dependent on the coupling constants of the theory. Shifting the ﬁelds around such a value complicates perturbation in powers of the coupling con- stants. However, as we have argued, the loop expansion is unaﬀected by such a shift. 10.4 Eﬀective potential at one loop Let us next calculate the eﬀective potential for the φ4 theory at one loop. In this case, the classical action is given by S[φ]= ∫ d4x ( 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ − m2 2 φ2 − λ 4! φ4) . (10.66) As we have seen earlier in Eq. (10.30), in this case, the classical dynamical equations are given by − δS[φ] δφ(x) =(∂μ∂μ + m2)φ(x)+ λ 3! φ3(x)= J(x) . (10.67) Furthermore, we note from Eq. (10.20) that the classical ﬁeld, φc(x), satisﬁes the equation January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 235 10.4 Effective potential at one loop 225 (∂μ∂μ + m 2)φc(x)+ λ 3! φ3 c(x) − iλℏ 2! φc(x) δφc(x) δJ(x) − λℏ2 3! δ2φc(x) δJ 2(x) = J(x) . (10.68) If we now use the relations (see Eqs. (10.7) and (10.29)) δΓ[φc] δφc(x) = −J(x) , δφc(x) δJ(y) = δ2W [J] δJ(x)δJ(y) = −G(x − y, φc) , (10.69) and remember that we are interested only in one loop eﬀects, then keeping terms up to linear power in ℏ, we obtain from Eq. (10.68) δΓ[φc] δφc(x) = −(∂μ∂μ + m 2)φc(x)− λ 3! φ3 c(x) + iλℏ 2! φc(x) δ2W [J] δJ 2(x) + O(ℏ2) = δS[φc] δφc(x) − iλℏ 2 φc(x)G(x − x, φc)+ O(ℏ2), (10.70) which can be written as δ (Γ[φc] − S[φc]) δφc(x) = − iλℏ 2 φc(x)G(0,φc)+ O(ℏ2). (10.71) If we expand the eﬀective action in a power series in ℏ as Γ[φc]= S[φc]+ ℏS1[φc]+ O(ℏ2) , (10.72) then, Eq. (10.71) leads to δ (ℏS1[φc]) δφc(x) + O(ℏ2)= − iλℏ 2 φc(x)G(0,φc)+ O(ℏ2) . (10.73) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 236 226 10 Effective action Therefore, to linear order in ℏ, we can consistently write δS1[φc] δφc(x) = − iλ 2 φc(x)G(0,φc) . (10.74) From the structure of the action (see Eq. (10.54)) S1[φc]= ∫ d4x (−V1(φc(x)) + ··· ) , (10.75) where V1 denotes the one loop potential and the dots represent terms with derivatives, we obtain δS1[φc] δφc(x) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φc(x)=φc = − ∂V1(φc) ∂φc . (10.76) Thus, if we restrict to φc(x)= φc = constant, then Eq. (10.74) takes the form ∂V1(φc) ∂φc = iλ 2 φcG(0,φc) . (10.77) Let us note that although the Green’s function G(x − y, φc)can itself have a power series expansion in ℏ, consistency requires that we only use the lowest order expression for the Green’s function in the above equation. Furthermore, noting from Eq. (10.34) that ∫ d4z δ2Γ[φc] δφc(x)δφc(z) δ2W [J] δJ(z)δJ(y) = −δ4(x − y), (10.78) this relation leads to the lowest order of the Green’s function that we are interested in as ∫ d4z δ2S[φc] δφc(x)δφc(z) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φc (−G(z − y, φc)) = −δ4(x − y), or,∫ d4z((∂μ∂μ + m 2 + λ 2 φ2 c)δ4(x − z))G(z − y, φc)= −δ4(x − y), or, (∂μ∂μ + m 2 + λ 2 φ2 c)G(x − y, φc)= −δ4(x − y), or, (∂μ∂μ + m 2 eﬀ )G(x − y, φc)= −δ4(x − y). (10.79) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 237 10.4 Effective potential at one loop 227 Here we have used the form of the action from Eq. (9.15) as well as Eq. (10.37) and have deﬁned m 2 eﬀ = m2 + λ 2 φ2 c . (10.80) The Green’s function can now be trivially determined and as we have seen before in Eq. (9.23) it has the form (the “iϵ”termis understood) G(x − y, φc)= ∫ d4k (2π)4 1 k2 − m2 eﬀ e−ik·(x−y) . (10.81) Substituting this back into Eq. (10.77), we obtain ∂V1(φc) ∂φc = iλ 2 φcG(0,φc)= iλ 2 φc ∫ d4k (2π)4 1 k2 − m2 eﬀ , or,V1(φc)= iλ 2 ∫ φc 0 dφc φc ∫ d4k (2π)4 1 k2 − m2 − λ 2 φ2 c . (10.82) Here, we are assuming that V1(φc = 0) = 0. If that is not true, then we have to add a constant term to the above expression. The one loop correction to the potential can now be determined by going over to Euclidean space and doing the integral. First, we note that if we interchange the orders of integration in Eq. (10.82), we obtain V1(φc)= iλ 2 ∫ d4k (2π)4 ∫ φc 0 dφc φc k2 − m2 − λ 2 φ2 c = − i 2 ∫ d4k (2π)4 ∫ φc 0 d ( λ 2 φ2 c) λ 2 φ2 c + m2 − k2 = − i 2 ∫ d4k (2π)4 ln ( λ 2 φ2 c + m2 − k2) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ φc 0 = − i 2 ∫ d4k (2π)4 ln ( λ 2 φ2 c + m2 − k2 m2 − k2 ) . (10.83) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 238 228 10 Effective action Now, rotating to Euclidean space (see Section 4.1), we obtain V1(φc)= − i 2 ∫ id4kE (2π)4 ln ( λ 2 φ2 c + m2 + k2 E m2 + k2 E ) = 1 2 ∫ d3Ω (2π)4 k3 EdkE ln ( λ 2 φ2 c + m2 + k2 E m2 + k2 E ) . (10.84) Since the integrand does not depend on the angular variables, the angular integration can be done trivially and has the value ∫ d3Ω=2π2, (10.85) so that we have V1(φc)= 1 2 1 (2π)4 (2π2) ∫ ∞ 0 1 2 (dk2 E) k2 E ln ( k2 E + m2 eﬀ k2 E + m2 ) = 1 32π2 ∫ ∞ 0 dk2 E k2 E ln ( k2 E + m2 eﬀ k2 E + m2 ) . (10.86) Deﬁning x = k2 E, (10.87) we note that the one loop potential takes the form V1(φc)= 1 32π2 ∫ ∞ 0 dxx (ln(x + m2 eﬀ ) − ln(x + m 2)) . (10.88) Clearly, the integral is divergent and, therefore, we have to cut oﬀ the integral at some high momentum scale to obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 239 10.4 Effective potential at one loop 229 V1(φc)= 1 32π2 ∫ Λ2 0 dxx (ln(x + m2 eﬀ ) − ln(x + m2)) ≃ 1 32π2 {[ Λ4 2 ( ln Λ2 − 1 2 ) + m 2 eﬀ Λ2 − m4 eﬀ 2 ln Λ2 + m4 eﬀ 2 ( ln m2 eﬀ − 1 2 )] − [ Λ4 2 (ln Λ2− 1 2 ) + m 2Λ2 − m4 2 ln Λ2 + m4 2 (ln m2− 1 2 )]} = 1 32π2 [(m2 eﬀ − m 2)Λ2 − m4 eﬀ 2 ln Λ2 μ2 + m4 2 ln Λ2 μ2 + m4 eﬀ 2 ( ln m2 eﬀ μ2 − 1 2 ) − m4 2 ( ln m2 μ2 − 1 2 )] = 1 32π2 [ λ 2 φ2 cΛ2 − λ 4 φ2 c (2m2 + λ 2 φ2 c ) ln Λ2 μ2 + 1 2 (m2 + λ 2 φ2 c)2( ln (m2 + λ 2 φ2 c) μ2 − 1 2 ) − m4 2 (ln m2 μ2 − 1 2 )] . (10.89) Here we have introduced an arbitrary mass scale μ to write the expression in a meaningful manner. Note that the one loop poten- tial, as it stands, diverges in the limit Λ →∞ which is the physical limit for the true value of the integral. This brings out one of the essential features of quantum ﬁeld theory. Namely, point-like inter- actions necessarily induce divergences simply because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, in this case, allows for an inﬁnite uncertainty in the momentum being exchanged. This necessitates a systematic procedure for eliminating divergences in such theories. This is known as the renormalization theory which we will not go into. Let us sim- ply note here that up to one loop, then, we can write the eﬀective January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 240 230 10 Effective action potential of the φ4 theory to be V (1) eﬀ = V + V1 .

January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 241 Chapter 11 Invariances and their consequences 11.1 Symmetries of the action Let us continue with the φ4 theory and note that, in this case, we have S[φ]= ∫ d4x L(φ, ∂μφ) , (11.1) where the Lagrangian density has the form L(φ, ∂μφ)= 1 2 ∂μφ∂μφ − m2 2 φ2 − λ 4! φ4,λ > 0. (11.2) We can write the action in Eq. (11.1) also in terms of the Lagrangian in the form S[φ]= ∫ dtL, (11.3) where L = ∫ d3x L(φ, ∂μφ) . (11.4) Given this theory where the basic variables are the ﬁelds φ(x), we can deﬁne the momentum (density) conjugate to the ﬁeld vari- ables in a straightforward manner as Π(x)= ∂L ∂ ˙φ(x) = ˙φ(x) . (11.5) 231 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 242 232 11 Invariances and their consequences This is the analogue of the relation between the momentum and ve- locity in classical mechanics, namely, p =˙x (for m = 1). In quantum ﬁeld theory, this then is the starting point for quantization in the op- erator language. However, in the path integral formalism, we treat all variables classically. Therefore, let us analyze various concepts in the classical language. First, let us note that given the Lagrangian in Eq. (11.3), we can obtain the Hamiltonian through a Legendre transformation as H = ∫ d3x Π(x) ˙φ(x) − L. (11.6) In the present case, we can write this out in detail as H = ∫ d3x (Π(x) ˙φ(x) − 1 2 ˙φ2(x)+ 1 2 ∇φ(x) · ∇φ(x) + m2 2 φ2(x)+ λ 4! φ4(x)) = ∫ d3x ( 1 2 Π 2(x)+ 1 2 ∇φ · ∇φ(x)+ m2 2 φ2(x)+ λ 4! φ4(x)). (11.7) Sometimes, this is also written as H = ∫ d3x( 1 2 ˙φ2(x)+ 1 2 ∇φ(x) · ∇φ(x)+ m2 2 φ2(x)+ λ 4! φ4(x) ). (11.8) However, this is not strictly correct since the Hamiltonian is not a function of velocity. Given a Lagrangian density, which depends only on φ(x)and ∂μφ(x), the Euler-Lagrange equation is obtained to be (this is simply the generalization of Eq. (1.31) to the case of a ﬁeld theory) − δS[φ] δφ(x) = ∂μ ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) − ∂L ∂φ(x) =0 , (11.9) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 243 11.1 Symmetries of the action 233 which gives the dynamics of the system. Given the dynamical equa- tions, we can ask how unique is the Lagrangian density for the system. The answer, not surprisingly, turns out to be that the Lagrangian density is unique only up to a total (four) divergence. Namely, both L(φ, ∂μφ), and L(φ, ∂μφ)+ ∂μKμ(φ, ∂λφ), (11.10) give the same Euler-Lagrange equation. We can, of course, check this directly. But a more intuitive way to understand this is to note that with the usual assumptions about the asymptotic fall oﬀ of the ﬁeld variables, we have SK = ∫ d4x LK = ∫ d4x∂μKμ(φ, ∂λφ)=0 . (11.11) In other words, a total divergence in the Lagrangian density does not change the action. Consequently, the variation of SK cannot contribute to the dynamical equations. (We note here that even when the asymptotic fall oﬀ of the ﬁelds is not fast enough, this statement remains true.) We can, of course, check this explicitly for speciﬁc examples. For example, choosing LK = ∂μKμ = ∂μ(φ∂μφ)= ∂μφ∂μφ + φ∂μ∂μφ, (11.12) the Euler-Lagrange equation gives δSK[φ] δφ(x) = ∂μ∂ν ∂LK ∂∂μ∂νφ − ∂μ ∂LK ∂∂μφ + ∂LK ∂φ = ∂μ∂μφ − 2∂μ∂μφ + ∂μ∂μφ ≡ 0 . (11.13) With this analysis, therefore, it is clear that a given system of dynamical equations will remain invariant under a set of inﬁnitesimal transformations of the ﬁeld variables of the form φ → φ + δφ , (11.14) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 244 234 11 Invariances and their consequences if and only if the corresponding Lagrangian density changes, at the most, by a total divergence under the same transformations. Namely, if L→L + ∂μKμ , (11.15) under a ﬁeld transformation, then the transformation deﬁnes an in- variance of the dynamical equations. Note that in the special case when Kμ = 0, the Lagrangian density itself is invariant under the set of ﬁeld transformations in Eq. (11.14) and, therefore, also deﬁnes a symmetry of the system. However, this deﬁnes a very special class of symmetries. In general, if under φ → φ + δφ , S[φ] → S[φ + δφ]= S[φ] , (11.16) then we say that the ﬁeld transformations deﬁne an invariance or a symmetry of the action and lead to a symmetry of the dynamical equations. Continuous transformations, by deﬁnition, depend on a param- eter of transformation continuously. This parameter can be a space- time independent parameter or it can depend on the space-time coordinates. In the ﬁrst case, the transformations would change the ﬁeld variables by the same amount at every space-time point. On the other hand, in the second case, the change in the ﬁeld variables will be diﬀerent at diﬀerent space-time points depending on the value of the parameter at that point. Accordingly, the two kinds of transfor- mations are known respectively as global and local transformations. The basic symmetries in gauge theories are local symmetries. 11.2 N¨other’s theorem In simple terms N¨other’s theorem says that, for every continuous global symmetry of a system, there exists a current density which is conserved. More speciﬁcally, it says that for a system described by a Lagrangian density L(φ, ∂μφ), if the inﬁnitesimal global transfor- mations January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 245 11.2 N¨other’s theorem 235 φ(x) → φ(x)+ δϵφ(x) , (11.17) where ϵ is the inﬁnitesimal constant parameter of transformation (the tensor indices of the ﬁelds as well as the parameters have been suppressed), deﬁne a symmetry of the system, in the sense that under these transformations L→L + δϵL = L + ∂μKμ(φ, ∂λφ, δϵφ) , (11.18) then, J μ ϵ (x)= ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) δϵφ(x) − Kμ(x) , (11.19) deﬁnes a current density which is conserved. To see that J μ ϵ (x) is indeed conserved, let us note that ∂μJ μ ϵ (x)= ∂μ ( ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) δϵφ(x)) − ∂μKμ(x) = (∂μ ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) ) δϵφ(x)+ ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) ∂μδϵφ(x) − ∂μKμ(x) = ∂L ∂φ(x) δϵφ(x)+ ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) δϵ(∂μφ(x)) − ∂μKμ(x) . (11.20) Here, we have used the Euler-Lagrange equation, Eq. (11.9), as well as the fact that ∂μδϵφ(x)= δϵ∂μφ(x) for a global transformation. We note next that the ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (11.20) simply give the inﬁnitesimal change in the Lagrangian density under the transforma- tions. Therefore, we can also write using Eq. (11.18) ∂μJ μ ϵ (x)= δϵL− ∂μKμ(x)=0 . (11.21) This shows that the current density given in Eq. (11.19) is indeed conserved. The current density deﬁned in Eq. (11.19) depends on January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 246 236 11 Invariances and their consequences the parameter of transformation in addition to the ﬁeld variables. A more fundamental quantity is the current density without the pa- rameter of transformation and let us denote this symbolically as J μ ϵ = ϵJ μ . (11.22) We have to remember that this is only a symbolic relation simply because the parameter ϵ may itself have a tensor structure depending on the transformation. In that case, the current density without the parameter will have a more complicated tensor structure as we will see shortly. (The conserved current density has a tensor structure one rank higher than the parameter of transformation.) It is worth pointing out here that the conserved N¨other current is unique up to the addition of a transverse vector. Namely, both J μ(x), and J μ improved(x)= J μ(x)+ ˜Kμ T ,∂μ ˜Kμ T =0, (11.23) can be considered as the conserved current associated with the symmetry. (This simply corresponds to the fact that Kμ has an arbitrariness up to adding a transverse part.) This ambiguity is proﬁtably used in some theories, mainly involving gravitation, to de- ﬁne improved currents which have matrix elements which are better behaved. But, we will not pursue this further in these lectures. As in classical electrodynamics, we know that given a conserved current density, we can deﬁne a charge which is a constant of motion as Q = ∫ d3xJ 0(x,t) . (11.24) The fact that this charge is a constant independent of time can be seen simply as dQ dt = d dt ∫ d3xJ 0(x,t)= ∫ d3x∂0J 0(x,t) = ∫ d3x (∂0J 0(x,t)+ ∇ · J(x,t)) . (11.25) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 247 11.2 N¨other’s theorem 237 Here, we have added a total divergence term whose integral van- ishes under our assumptions on the asymptotic behavior of the ﬁeld variables. Thus, we have dQ dt = ∫ d3x∂μJ μ =0 , (11.26) which follows from the conservation of the current density discussed in Eqs. (11.21) and (11.22). This shows that the charge is a constant of motion. Since Q is a constant of motion, this implies classically that the Poisson bracket of Q with H vanishes. Quantum mechanically, it is the commutator of the two operators which vanishes [Q, H]=0 . (11.27) But this is precisely the symmetry condition in quantum mechan- ics. Namely, we know from our studies in quantum mechanics that a transformation is a symmetry of the system if the generator of the inﬁnitesimal symmetry transformation commutes with the Hamilto- nian (which implies that they can have simultaneous eigenstates). Conversely, any operator which commutes with the Hamiltonian is the generator of an inﬁnitesimal global symmetry transformation which leaves the system invariant. Thus, we recognize Q to be the generator of the inﬁnitesimal symmetry transformations in the present case. This simply means that the inﬁnitesimal change in any variable (operator) can be obtained from the commutator (we are setting ℏ =1) δϵφ = −i[ϵQ, φ] . (11.28) (Classically, we should use appropriate Poisson bracket relations.) It is now clear that the vanishing of the commutator between Q and H simply reﬂects the fact that the Hamiltonian is invariant under the symmetry transformations as we would expect. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the unitary operator implementing ﬁ- nite symmetry transformations can be written in terms of the gen- erators of inﬁnitesimal transformations as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 248 238 11 Invariances and their consequences U (α)= e− i ℏ αQ , (11.29) where α is the constant parameter of ﬁnite transformation. Under such a transformation a ﬁeld operator is supposed to transform as φ(x) → U (α)φ(x)U −1(α)= e− i ℏ αQφ(x)e i ℏ αQ . (11.30) And, furthermore, a true symmetry transformation of the physical system (theory) is supposed to leave the ground state of the sys- tem or the vacuum invariant (in addition to leaving the Hamiltonian invariant), namely, U (α)|0⟩ = e−iαQ|0⟩ = |0⟩ . (11.31) Equivalently, it follows from Eq. (11.31) that Q|0⟩ =0 . (11.32) In other words, for a true symmetry, the conserved charge annihi- lates the vacuum (the vacuum carries zero charge quantum number). Therefore, in such a case, we note from Eq. (11.28) that for any ﬁeld operator in the theory ⟨0|δϵφ(x)|0⟩ = −i⟨0|[ϵQ, φ(x)]|0⟩ =0 , (11.33) where we have used Eq. (11.32). As we will see shortly, if there is a spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry, then, the conserved charge Q does not annihilate the vacuum and that under the transformation the vacuum expectation value of the change of some operator in the theory becomes nonzero. 11.2.1 Example As an example of N¨other’s theorem, let us study global space-time translations as a symmetry of quantum ﬁeld theories. Let us continue to use the φ4 theory for this discussion. Let us deﬁne the inﬁnitesimal translations January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 249 11.2 N¨other’s theorem 239 xμ → xμ + ϵμ, or,δϵxμ = ϵμ , (11.34) as the global transformations where ϵμ is the inﬁnitesimal constant parameter of transformation. In such a case (repeated indices are being summed), δϵφ(x)= φ(x + ϵ) − φ(x)= ϵμ∂μφ(x) , δϵ∂μφ(x)= ∂μφ(x + ϵ) − ∂μφ(x) = ∂μ(δϵφ(x)) = ϵν∂μ∂νφ(x) . (11.35) Given this, we can obtain the inﬁnitesimal change in the Lagrangian density in Eq. (11.2) L = 1 2 ∂μφ(x)∂μφ(x) − m2 2 φ2(x) − λ 4! φ4(x) , (11.36) in a straightforward manner. However, a much simpler way to eval- uate the change is to note that the Lagrangian density is eﬀectively (implicitly) a function of x,namely, L = L(x). Thus, δϵL = L(x + ϵ) −L(x)= ϵμ∂μL(x)= ∂μKμ , (11.37) where we have determined Kμ = ϵμL(x)= ϵμL(φ, ∂μφ) , (11.38) in the present case. On the other hand, we see from Eq. (11.2) that for this theory ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) = ∂μφ(x) . (11.39) As a result, we see from Eqs. (11.35), (11.38) and (11.19), that the N¨other current density deﬁned in Eq. (11.19), in this case, follows to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 250 240 11 Invariances and their consequences J μ ϵ (x)= ∂L ∂∂μφ(x) δϵφ(x) − Kμ = ∂μφ(x)(ϵν∂νφ(x)) − ϵμL = ϵν(∂μφ(x)∂νφ(x) − δμ ν L) = ϵν(∂μφ(x)∂νφ(x) − ημνL) . (11.40) This is the conserved current density associated with transla- tions and the current density without the parameter of transforma- tion has the form (see Eq. (11.22)) J μ ϵ (x)= ϵνT μν , (11.41) where we see from Eq. (11.40) that T μν = ∂μφ(x)∂νφ(x) − ημνL . (11.42) There are several comments in order here. First, let us note that the fundamental conserved current density (in this case T μν) is not nec- essarily a vector. Its tensorial character depends completely on the parameter of transformation (in the present case a vector). Second, we note from Eq. (11.42) that the conserved current density, in this case, is a symmetric second rank tensor density which is conserved, namely, T μν = T νμ,∂μT μν =0. (11.43) This is known as the stress tensor of the theory. Let us also note from Eqs. (11.24) and (11.42) that the conserved charge, in this case, is a four vector and has the form P μ = ∫ d3xT 0μ . (11.44) To understand the meaning of the charges in Eq. (11.44) (there are, in fact, four of them), let us write them out explicitly. We note from Eqs. (11.42) and (11.44) that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 251 11.3 Complex scalar field 241 P 0 = ∫ d3xT 00 = ∫ d3x (( ˙φ(x))2 −L) = ∫ d3x (( ˙φ(x))2 − 1 2 ˙φ2(x)+ 1 2 ∇φ · ∇φ + m2 2 φ2(x)+ λ 4! φ4(x)) = ∫ d3x ( 1 2 ˙φ2(x)+ 1 2 ∇φ · ∇φ + m2 2 φ2(x)+ λ 4! φ4(x)) = H, P i = ∫ d3xT 0i = ∫ d3x ˙φ∂iφ, or, P = − ∫ d3x ˙φ(x)∇φ(x) . (11.45) We recognize the ﬁrst conserved quantity (namely, P 0) as the Hamil- tonian of the system obtained in Eq. (11.8) and from relativistic in- variance we conclude that P must represent the total momentum of the system. Thus, we recover the familiar result that inﬁnitesi- mal space-time translations are generated by the energy-momentum operators of the theory. Furthermore, if translations are true sym- metries of the quantum ﬁeld theory, the conserved charge operators, P μ, must annihilate the vacuum P μ|0⟩ =0, which we have talked about earlier. (In quantum ﬁeld theory, the charge operators are normal ordered so that the annihilation opera- tors stand to the right of the creation operators.) 11.3 Complex scalar ﬁeld So far we have discussed the φ4 theory where the basic ﬁeld variable is real. As we have mentioned before, such a theory can describe January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 252 242 11 Invariances and their consequences spin zero mesons which are charge neutral. Let us next consider a scalar ﬁeld theory where the basic ﬁeld variable is complex. Namely, in this case, φ∗(x) ̸= φ(x) . (11.46) One way to study such a theory is to expand the complex ﬁeld in terms of two real ﬁelds as φ(x)= 1 √2 (φ1(x)+ iφ2(x)) . (11.47) However, let us continue with the complex ﬁeld φ(x) as the basic variable. The real Lagrangian density describing quartic interactions can be generalized from Eq. (11.2) and has the form L(φ, φ∗)= ∂μφ∗∂μφ − m2φ∗φ − λ 4 (φ∗φ)2 , (11.48) with λ> 0. We can treat φ and φ∗ as independent dynamical vari- ables. Correspondingly, the two Euler-Lagrange equations following from Eq. (11.48) are given by − δS[φ, φ∗] δφ∗(x) = ∂μ ∂L ∂∂μφ∗ − ∂L ∂φ∗ =0, or, (∂μ∂μ + m 2)φ + λ 2 (φ∗φ)φ =0 , (11.49) and − δS[φ, φ∗] δφ(x) = ∂μ ∂L ∂∂μφ − ∂L ∂φ =0, or, (∂μ∂μ + m 2)φ∗ + λ 2 (φ∗φ)φ∗ =0 . (11.50) Thus, the two dynamical equations in Eqs. (11.49) and (11.50) corre- spond to two coupled scalar ﬁeld equations. We should have expected January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 253 11.3 Complex scalar field 243 this since having a complex ﬁeld doubles the number of degrees of freedom. Let us next note that if we make a ﬁnite phase transformation of the form φ(x) → e−iαφ(x), φ∗(x) → eiαφ∗(x) , (11.51) where α is a real, constant (global) parameter of transformation or equivalently, an inﬁnitesimal transformation of the form (ϵ is in- ﬁnitesimal) δϵφ(x)= −iϵφ(x) , δϵφ∗(x)= iϵφ∗(x) , (11.52) then, under such a transformation φ∗φ → eiαφ∗e−iαφ = φ∗φ. (11.53) Equivalently, under the inﬁnitesimal transformations of Eq. (11.52), we note that δϵ(φ∗φ)=(δϵφ∗)φ + φ∗(δϵφ)= iϵφ∗φ − iϵφ∗φ =0 . (11.54) Namely, under the transformation in Eq. (11.51) or (11.52), the prod- uct φ∗φ remains unchanged. Similarly, we note that under the trans- formation of Eq. (11.51) ∂μφ∗∂μφ → ∂μ(eiαφ∗)∂μ(e−iαφ)= ∂μφ∗∂μφ. (11.55) Alternatively, from the form of the inﬁnitesimal transformations in Eq. (11.52), we obtain δϵ(∂μφ∗∂μφ)= (δϵ(∂μφ∗))∂μφ + ∂μφ∗(δϵ(∂μφ)) = ∂μ(δϵφ∗)∂μφ + ∂μφ∗(∂μ(δϵφ)) = iϵ∂μφ∗∂μφ − iϵ∂μφ∗∂μφ =0 . (11.56) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 254 244 11 Invariances and their consequences (It is important to recognize that the invariance in Eqs. (11.55) and (11.56) results because the parameter of transformation is assumed to be independent of space-time coordinates.) In this case, therefore, we see that the constant phase transfor- mations deﬁne a symmetry of the theory, in the sense that, L = ∂μφ∗∂μφ − m2φ∗φ − λ 4 (φ∗φ)2 →L . (11.57) Equivalently, under the inﬁnitesimal transformations δϵL =0 . (11.58) Such a symmetry transformation, where the space-time coordinates do not change, is called an internal symmetry. For such an invariance, we note that Kμ =0 . (11.59) Therefore, the conserved current density constructed through the N¨other procedure has the form (see Eq. (11.19)) J μ ϵ = ∂L ∂∂μφ∗ δϵφ∗ + ∂L ∂∂μφ δϵφ = ∂μφ(iϵφ∗)+ ∂μφ∗(−iϵφ) = iϵ (φ∗∂μφ − (∂μφ∗)φ) = ϵ(iφ∗ ↔ ∂μ φ)= ϵJ μ, (11.60) wherewehavedeﬁned J μ = iφ∗ ↔ ∂μ φ ≡ i(φ∗∂μφ − (∂μφ∗) φ) . (11.61) The conserved current density J μ, in this case, is a four vector very much like the electromagnetic current density (the parameter of transformation is a scalar). Therefore, it can be identiﬁed with the January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 255 11.4 Ward identities 245 electromagnetic current density associated with this system. Con- sequently, this theory can describe charged spin zero mesons. The conserved charge, for the present case, can be written as Q = ∫ d3xJ 0 = ∫ d3xi(φ∗ ˙φ − ˙φ∗φ) = i ∫ d3x (φ∗ ˙φ − ˙φ∗φ) . (11.62) In quantum ﬁeld theory, Q would represent the electric charge op- erator. As we have mentioned earlier, if the phase transformations in Eq. (11.51) or (11.52) deﬁne a true symmetry of the system, then the charge operator in Eq. (11.62) (normal ordered) would annihilate the vacuum. In other words, in such a case, we would have Q|0⟩ =0 , (11.63) corresponding to the fact that the vacuum is charge neutral. (Vac- uum is an eigenstate of Q with zero eigenvalue.) 11.4 Ward identities Symmetries are quite important in the study of physical theories for various reasons. First of all, they lead to conserved quantities and conserved quantum numbers. But more importantly, in quan- tum ﬁeld theories they give rise to relations between various Green’s functions and, therefore, between the transition amplitudes. Thus, as an example, let us consider the generating functional for the complex scalar ﬁeld in the presence of sources Z[J, J ∗]= eiW [J,J ∗] = N ∫ DφDφ∗ eiS[φ,φ∗,J,J ∗] . (11.64) Letusnoteherethatwehaveset ℏ = 1 for simplicity and that we have deﬁned S[φ, φ∗,J,J ∗]= S[φ, φ∗]+ ∫ d4x(J ∗φ + Jφ∗) , (11.65) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 256 246 11 Invariances and their consequences with S[φ, φ∗] representing the dynamical action for the system. Here, we note that J ∗ is the source for the ﬁeld φ whereas J corresponds to the source for φ∗. Note also that even though the action S[φ, φ∗]is invariant under the global phase transformations of Eq. (11.52), the complete action S[φ, φ∗,J,J ∗] is not symmetric unless we simultane- ously change J and J ∗ also. In fact, let us note that inﬁnitesimally, δϵS[φ, φ∗,J,J ∗]= δϵS[φ, φ∗]+ δϵ (∫ d4x (J ∗φ + Jφ∗)) = ∫ d4x (J ∗δϵφ + Jδϵφ∗) = −iϵ ∫ d4x (J ∗φ − Jφ∗) . (11.66) Since the generating functional does not depend on the ﬁeld variables (that is, the ﬁelds are all integrated out), making a ﬁeld re- deﬁnition in the integrand of the path integral should not change the generating functional. In particular, if the redeﬁnition corresponds to the inﬁnitesimal phase transformations deﬁned in Eq. (11.52), then we will have δϵZ[J, J ∗]=0= N ∫ DφDφ∗ iδϵSeiS[φ,φ∗,J,J ∗] = N ∫ DφDφ∗ (ϵ ∫ d4x (J ∗φ − Jφ∗)) eiS[φ,φ∗,J,J ∗] , (11.67) where we have used Eq. (11.66). In general, one should also worry about the change coming from the Jacobian under a ﬁeld redeﬁni- tion. In the present case, the Jacobian for the inﬁnitesimal ﬁeld redeﬁnition can be easily checked to be unity. Let us recall that by deﬁnition, δZ[J, J ∗] δJ(x) = iN ∫ DφDφ∗ φ∗(x) eiS[φ,φ∗,J,J ∗] , δZ[J, J ∗] δJ ∗(x) = iN ∫ DφDφ∗ φ(x) eiS[φ,φ∗,J,J ∗] . (11.68) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 257 11.4 Ward identities 247 Using this then, Eq. (11.67) becomes ϵ ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) (−i δZ δJ ∗(x) ) − J(x) (−i δZ δJ(x) )) =0. (11.69) This must hold for any arbitrary value of the parameter ϵ and, there- fore, we conclude that ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) δ δJ ∗(x) − J(x) δ δJ(x) ) Z[J, J ∗]=0, or, ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) δ δJ ∗(x) − J(x) δ δJ(x) ) eiW [J,J ∗] =0, or, ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) δW δJ ∗(x) − J(x) δW δJ(x) ) =0 . (11.70) This is the master equation for deﬁning symmetry relations between connected Green’s functions. By taking higher functional derivatives of Eq. (11.70), we can obtain relations between various connected n-point Green’s functions as a result of the symmetry in theproblem. Inthiscase, thesymmetryrelations arequite simple (simply because the symmetry transformations in Eq. (11.52) are simple), but in the case of more complicated symmetries such as gauge symmetries, such relations are extremely useful and go under the name of Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory (also known as Slavnov-Taylor identities particularly in the case of non-Abelian gauge symmetries). It is interesting to note that we could also have derived the Ward identities from a combined set of transformations of the form δϵφ = −iϵφ, δϵφ∗ = iϵφ∗, δϵJ = −iϵJ, δϵJ ∗ = iϵJ ∗ . (11.71) In such a case, it is easy to see that the complete action in Eq. (11.65) is invariant. Namely, δϵS[φ, φ∗,J,J ∗]=0 . (11.72) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 258 248 11 Invariances and their consequences Therefore, from Z[J, J ∗]= eiW [J,J ∗] = N ∫ DφDφ∗ eiS[φ,φ∗,J,J ∗] , (11.73) we obtain δϵZ[J, J ∗]= N ∫ DφDφ∗ (iδϵS) eiS[φ,φ∗,J,J ∗] =0, or,iδϵW [J, J ∗]eiW [J,J ∗] =0, or,δϵW [J, J ∗]=0, or, ∫ d4x ( δW δJ ∗(x) δϵJ ∗(x)+ δW δJ(x) δϵJ(x)) =0, or,iϵ ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) δW δJ ∗(x) − J(x) δW δJ(x) ) =0, or, ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) δW δJ ∗(x) − J(x) δW δJ(x) ) =0 . (11.74) This is, of course, the same relation as in Eq. (11.70). Let us note that in the case of a complex scalar ﬁeld we will have a complex classical ﬁeld deﬁned by (see Eq. (10.7)) φc(x)= δW δJ ∗(x) = ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩J,J ∗, φ∗ c(x)= δW δJ(x) = ⟨0|φ∗(x)|0⟩J,J ∗ . (11.75) From the transformation properties of the ﬁelds φ(x)and φ∗(x)in Eq. (11.52), we can immediately determine the transformation prop- erties of the vacuum expectation values in Eq. (11.75). Namely, we obtain (this corresponds to asking, by how much would φc(x) change if we change φ(x) according to Eq. (11.52)) δϵφc(x)= ⟨0|δϵφ(x)|0⟩J,J ∗ = −iϵ⟨0|φ(x)|0⟩J,J ∗ = −iϵφc(x), δϵφ∗ c(x)= ⟨0|δϵφ∗(x)|0⟩J,J ∗ = iϵ⟨0|φ∗(x)|0⟩J,J ∗ = iϵφ∗ c(x), (11.76) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 259 11.4 Ward identities 249 where we have assumed the invariance of the vacuum state under such a transformation. From the transformation properties of the classi- cal ﬁelds in Eq. (11.76), we can now work out the Ward-Takahashi identities for the 1PI vertex functions. In the present case, we note that the eﬀective action is given by Γ[φc,φ∗ c]= W [J, J ∗] − ∫ d4x (J ∗(x)φc(x)+ J(x)φ∗ c(x)) , (11.77) from which it follows that δϵΓ[φc,φ∗ c]= − ∫ d4x (J ∗(x)δϵφc(x)+ J(x)δϵφ∗ c(x)) = iϵ ∫ d4x (J ∗(x)φc(x) − J(x)φ∗ c(x)) = iϵ ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) δW δJ ∗(x) − J(x) δW δJ(x) ) =0 . (11.78) Here in the last step, we have used the relation in Eq. (11.70). This shows that the inﬁnitesimal transformations deﬁne a symmetry of the eﬀective action as well. On the other hand, we note that using Eq. (11.76) we can write δϵΓ[φc,φ∗ c]= ∫ d4x ( δΓ δφc(x) δϵφc(x)+ δΓ δφ∗ c(x) δϵφ∗ c(x)) = −iϵ ∫ d4x ( δΓ δφc(x) φc(x) − δΓ δφ∗ c(x) φ∗ c(x)) . (11.79) Therefore, following Eq. (11.78), we can set this to zero and noting that the parameter ϵ is arbitrary, we obtain ∫ d4x ( δΓ δφc(x) φc(x) − δΓ δφ∗ c(x) φ∗ c(x)) =0. (11.80) This is the master equation and by taking higher order functional derivatives we can derive relations between various 1PI vertex func- tions, as a consequence of the symmetry in the theory. We note here January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 260 250 11 Invariances and their consequences that the relation in Eq. (11.80) could have been derived directly from the master equation in Eq. (11.70) using various deﬁnitions as follows ∫ d4x (J ∗(x) δW δJ ∗(x) − J(x) δW δJ(x) ) =0, or, ∫ d4x (− δΓ δφc(x) φc(x) − (− δΓ δφ∗ c(x) ) φ∗ c(x)) =0, or, ∫ d4x ( δΓ δφc(x) φc(x) − δΓ δφ∗ c(x) φ∗ c(x)) =0. (11.81) 11.5 Spontaneous symmetry breaking Let us next consider the complex scalar ﬁeld theory deﬁned by the Lagrangian density (if the ﬁelds are treated as operators, φ∗ should be replaced by φ†) L = ∂μφ∗∂μφ + m2φ∗φ − λ 4 (φ∗φ)2,λ > 0 . (11.82) This is the same Lagrangian density as in Eq. (11.48) except for the sign in the mass term which is opposite. It is clear that this Lagrangian density is also invariant under the global phase trans- formations in Eq. (11.51) or (11.52) since each individual term is. Therefore, the phase transformations deﬁne a symmetry of this the- ory as well and according to N¨other’s theorem, there exists a con- served charge which is the same as given in Eq. (11.61). For constant ﬁeld conﬁgurations, if we look at the potential of this theory, namely, V (φ, φ∗)= −m2φ∗φ + λ 4 (φ∗φ)2, (11.83) we note that the extrema of the potential occur at January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 261 11.5 Spontaneous symmetry breaking 251 ∂V ∂φ∗ = (−m2 + λ 2 φ∗φ) φ =0 , ∂V ∂φ = (−m2 + λ 2 φ∗φ) φ∗ =0 . (11.84) There are two solutions of these extremum conditions which are easily obtained to be φc = φ∗ c =0 , φ∗ cφc = 2m2 λ . (11.85) However, it is quite easy to see that ∂2V ∂φ∗∂φ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φ=φ∗=0 = −m2 , (11.86) whereas ∂2V ∂φ∗∂φ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φ∗φ= 2m2 λ = λ 2 φ∗φ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φ∗φ= 2m2 λ = m2 . (11.87) Consequently, the extremum at φc = φ∗ c = 0 is really a local maxi- mum of the potential whereas the true minimum occurs at φ∗ cφc = 2m2 λ . (11.88) Note that since for constant ﬁeld conﬁgurations the derivative terms vanish, this also deﬁnes the ﬁeld conﬁguration for the true minimum of energy or the true ground state of this theory. To better understand what is involved here, let us express the complex ﬁeld in terms of two real scalar ﬁelds. Namely, let us write φ = 1 √2 (σ + iρ) , (11.89) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 262 252 11 Invariances and their consequences where we assume that σ and ρ are real (Hermitian) scalar ﬁelds. In terms of these variables, then, the minimum of the potential occurs at φ∗ cφc = 1 2 (σ2 c + ρ 2 c)= 2m2 λ , or,σ2 c + ρ 2 c = 4m2 λ . (11.90) It is clear that, in this case, there is an inﬁnite number of degenerate minima lying on a circle in the σ-ρ plane. For simplicity, let us choose ρc = 0. Then, the minimum of the potential is determined from σ2 c = 4m2 λ or,σc = ± 2m √λ . (11.91) Let us, in fact choose the minimum to be at (the choice of a minimum breaks the symmetry of the theory) σc = 2m √λ ,ρc =0 . (11.92) In this case, therefore, we see that one of the ﬁelds develops a vacuum expectation value, namely, σc = ⟨0|σ(x)|0⟩ = 2m √λ , ρc = ⟨0|ρ(x)|0⟩ =0 . (11.93) To understand further the meaning of this, let us plot the po- tential in Eq. (11.83) as a function of σ and ρ for constant values of the ﬁelds which is shown in Fig. 11.1. We note that V (σ, ρ)= − m2 2 (σ2 + ρ 2)+ λ 16 (σ2 + ρ 2)2,λ > 0 . (11.94) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 263 11.5 Spontaneous symmetry breaking 253 σ V (σ, ρ) ρ − 2m√ λ 2m√λ V =0 Figure 11.1: Mexican hat potential exhibiting a nontrivial minimum. Thus, the potential, in the present case, is very much like the instan- ton potential in Eq. (7.54), but the minima are inﬁnitely degenerate. Popularly, such a potential is known as the Mexican hat potential. Let us also note that since φ = 1 √2 (σ + iρ) , (11.95) we can deduce from the transformation rule in Eq. (11.52) δφ = −iϵφ, (11.96) that 1 √2 (δσ + iδρ)= −iϵ 1 √2 (σ + iρ), or,δσ + iδρ = ϵ(ρ − iσ) . (11.97) From this we conclude that under the global phase transformations the real scalar ﬁelds transform as δσ = ϵρ, δρ = −ϵσ . (11.98) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 264 254 11 Invariances and their consequences In other words, the global phase transformations correspond to a rotation in the σ-ρ plane. Let us also note from our earlier discussion in Eq. (11.28) that the inﬁnitesimal change in any operator, under the symmetry trans- formation, can be expressed as a commutator with the charge asso- ciated with the transformation as δσ = −iϵ [Q, σ]= ϵρ , δρ = −iϵ [Q, ρ]= −ϵσ . (11.99) Therefore, since with our choice in Eq. (11.93) ⟨0|σ(x)|0⟩ = σc = 2m √λ , (11.100) we conclude using Eq. (11.98) that ⟨0|δρ|0⟩ = −ϵ⟨0|σ|0⟩ = −ϵ 2m √λ , or, − iϵ⟨0|[Q, ρ]|0⟩ = −ϵ 2m √λ . (11.101) It is clear, therefore, that in the present case we must have Q|0⟩ ̸=0 , (11.102) in order that the relation in Eq. (11.101) is consistent. In such a case, we say that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian (or the theory) is spontaneously broken. (As we mentioned earlier, the choice of a minimum and, therefore, a vacuum state breaks the symmetry of the theory.) Since Q does not annihilate the vacuum of the present theory, let us assume that the charge takes the vacuum to a state Q|0⟩ = |χ⟩ . (11.103) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 265 11.5 Spontaneous symmetry breaking 255 We know from Eq. (11.27) that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian implies that [Q, H]=0 . (11.104) Assuming that the vacuum state has zero energy (i.e. H|0⟩ =0), we then obtain using Eq. (11.103) [Q, H]|0⟩ =0, or, (QH − HQ)|0⟩ =0, or,HQ|0⟩ =0, or,H|χ⟩ =0 . (11.105) In other words, the state |χ⟩ deﬁned in Eq. (11.103) would appear to be degenerate with the vacuum in energy (even when the vacuum state does not have zero energy). We may, therefore, conclude that this is another vacuum state in the Hilbert space (namely, it would suggest that the vacuum state of the theory is not unique). The problem with this interpretation is that this state is not normalizable. This can be easily seen from Eq. (11.103) and (11.24) as follows. (Q is seen from Eq. (11.62) to be Hermitian and we set ℏ =1 for simplicity.) ⟨χ|χ⟩ = ⟨0|QQ|0⟩ = 〈0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∫ d3xJ 0(x,t)Q∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 0〉 = ∫ d3x ⟨0|eiP ·xJ 0(0)e−iP ·xQ|0⟩ . (11.106) We have already seen that the Hamiltonian commutes with Q ex- pressing the fact that the charge is independent of time. Since Q does not depend on spatial coordinates either, it follows that the momentum operator also commutes with Q. In fact, in general, we can write [Pμ,Q]=0 . (11.107) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 266 256 11 Invariances and their consequences There are many ways of obtaining this result besides the argument given above. The most intuitive way is to note that Pμ generates space-time translations whereas Q generates a phase transformation in the internal Hilbert space. Both these transformations are inde- pendent of each other and, therefore, their order should not matter which is equivalent to saying that the generators must commute. A consequence of their commutativity is that we have e−iP ·xQ = Qe−iP ·x . (11.108) Using this in Eq. (11.106), then, we obtain ⟨χ|χ⟩ = ∫ d3x ⟨0|eiP ·xJ 0(0)Qe−iP ·x|0⟩ = ∫ d3x ⟨0|J 0(0)Q|0⟩ = ⟨0|J 0(0)Q|0⟩ ∫ d3x →∞ , (11.109) where we have used the property of the ground state, namely, Pμ|0⟩ =0 . (11.110) In other words, the state |χ⟩ is not normalizable and hence cannot be thought of as another vacuum in the Hilbert space. This analysis also shows that the ﬁnite transformation operator U (α)= e−iαQ , (11.111) does not act unitarily on the Hilbert space. (It takes states out of the Hilbert space.) In fact, it is straightforward to show that the charge Q may not exist when there is spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. Let us note, however, that even though Q may not exist, commutators such as [Q, φ(x)] , (11.112) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 267 11.5 Spontaneous symmetry breaking 257 are well deﬁned in such a theory and as a result ﬁnite ﬁeld transfor- mations such as U (α)φ(x)U −1(α)= e−iαQφ(x)eiαQ , (11.113) are also well deﬁned. Another way of saying this is to note that while the operator U (α) deﬁnes unitary transformations for the ﬁeld variables (operators), it does not act unitarily on the Hilbert space. This is another manifestation of spontaneous symmetry breaking. To analyze further the consequences of spontaneous symme- try breaking, let us note that even classically, if the potential has a nontrivial minimum, then a stable perturbation would require us to expand the theory around the stable minimum. Correspondingly, let us deﬁne σ →⟨σ⟩ + σ = 2m √λ + σ, ρ →⟨ρ⟩ + ρ = ρ. (11.114) In this case, the Lagrangian density of the theory in Eq. (11.82) becomes L = ∂μφ∗∂μφ + m2φ∗φ − λ 4 (φ∗φ)2 = 1 2 ∂μσ∂μσ + 1 2 ∂μρ∂μρ + m2 2 (σ2 + ρ 2) − λ 16 (σ2 + ρ 2)2 → 1 2 ∂μ (σ + 2m √λ ) ∂μ (σ + 2m √λ ) + 1 2 ∂μρ∂μρ + m2 2 ((σ + 2m √λ )2 + ρ 2) − λ 16 ((σ + 2m √λ )2 + ρ 2)2 = 1 2 ∂μσ∂μσ + 1 2 ∂μρ∂μρ + m2 2 (σ2 + ρ 2 + 4m √λ σ + 4m2 λ ) − λ 16 (σ2 + ρ 2 + 4m √λ σ + 4m2 λ )2 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 268 258 11 Invariances and their consequences = 1 2 ∂μσ∂μσ + 1 2 ∂μρ∂μρ + σ2 ( m2 2 − m 2 − m2 2 ) + ρ 2 ( m2 2 − m2 2 ) + σ ( 2m3 √λ − 2m3 √λ ) + ( 2m4 λ − m4 λ ) − m√λ 2 σ(σ2 + ρ 2) − λ 16 (σ2 + ρ 2)2 = 1 2 ∂μσ∂μσ + 1 2 ∂μρ∂μρ − m2σ2 + m4 λ − m√λ 2 σ(σ2 + ρ2) − λ 16 (σ2 + ρ 2)2 . (11.115) We now see the interesting fact that while the ﬁeld σ is mas- sive with the right sign for the mass term, the ﬁeld ρ has become massless. This is a general feature of spontaneous symmetry break- ing, namely, whenever a continuous symmetry is spontaneously bro- ken in a manifestly Lorentz invariant theory with a positive metric, there necessarily arise massless ﬁelds (particles). These are known as the Goldstone ﬁelds (Nambu-Goldstone ﬁelds) or Goldstone modes (particles). In the present case, we note that ρ corresponds to the Goldstone ﬁeld and let us recall our earlier result, namely, ⟨0|δρ|0⟩ = −ϵ 2m √λ . (11.116) This is also a general feature of theories with spontaneously broken symmetries. Namely, in such theories, the change in the Goldstone ﬁeld under the symmetry transformation acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. In terms of the plot of the potential in Fig. 11.1, it is easier to understand the Goldstone mode intuitively. The mini- mum of the potential occurs along a valley and the Goldstone mode simply reﬂects the motion along the valley of the potential. In particle physics, one does not know of elementary spin zero particles which are massless. The closest that comes to being mass- less is the pi-meson (≈ 140MeV). The Goldstone particles were, therefore, not well received by the particle physics community in the beginning. However, in the presence of gauge ﬁelds like the photon ﬁeld, the Goldstone modes get absorbed into the longitudinal com- ponents of the gauge bosons eﬀectively making them (gauge bosons) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 269 11.6 Goldstone theorem 259 massive. This is known as the Higgs mechanism and is widely used in the physical models of fundamental interactions. A massless ﬁeld or a massless particle, of course, has associated with it an inﬁnite characteristic length (Compton length). The most familiar massless ﬁeld is the photon ﬁeld and we know that as a con- sequence of the photon being massless, the Coulomb force has an inﬁnite range. In fact, we recognize that the two point function in such a theory has an inﬁnite correlation signifying that two charged particles feel the presence of each other even at inﬁnite separation. Similarly, we conclude that when Goldstone modes are present, cer- tain correlation lengths will become inﬁnite. 11.6 Goldstone theorem In a manifestly Lorentz invariant quantum ﬁeld theory with a posi- tive metric for the Hilbert space, the Goldstone theorem states that if there is spontaneous breakdown of a continuous symmetry, then there must exist massless particles (Nambu-Goldstone particles) in the theory. To see a general proof of this theorem, let us assume that we have a theory of n-scalar ﬁelds described by the Lagrangian density L = L(φi,∂μφi),i =1, 2, ··· ,n. (11.117) Furthermore, let us assume that the global transformations δϵφi = Tij(ϵ)φj , (11.118) where we assume summation over repeated indices and where the global parameter of transformation, ϵ, may itself have an index, de- ﬁne a symmetry of the theory described by the Lagrangian density in Eq. (11.117). In this case, we can deﬁne the generating functional with appropriate sources as (ℏ =1) Z[Ji]= eiW [Ji] = N ∫ Dφi eiS[φi,Ji] . (11.119) Furthermore, the classical ﬁelds are deﬁned to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 270 260 11 Invariances and their consequences φic(x)= δW δJi(x) = ⟨0|φi(x)|0⟩Jk . (11.120) The case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, of course, corresponds to having nontrivial φic’s when the sources are turned oﬀ. Namely, even if for one of the values of i, φic = φic(x)|Jk=0 = δW δJi(x) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Jk=0 ̸=0 , (11.121) then, we will have spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry. Let us note from Eqs. (11.76) and (11.118) that the classical ﬁelds would transform under the symmetry transformations as δϵφic(x)= Tij(ϵ)φjc(x) . (11.122) We also know from Eq. (10.29) that the 1PI vertex functional satisﬁes the deﬁning relation δΓ[φic] δφic(x) = −Ji(x) . (11.123) When the sources are turned oﬀ, this deﬁnes the extremum equa- tion whose solutions, φic, will have at least one nonzero value if the symmetry is spontaneously broken. Given the above relation, we can also obtain −δϵJi(x)= ∫ d4y δ2Γ[φic] δφic(x)δφjc(y) δϵφjc(y) = ∫ d4y δ2Γ[φic] δφic(x)δφjc(y) Tjk(ϵ)φkc(y) . (11.124) When we switch oﬀ the sources, consistency of Eq. (11.124) will lead to (in this case φic(x)= φic = constant) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 271 11.7 References 261 ∫ d4y δ2Γ δφic(x)δφjc(y) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣φic Tjk(ϵ)φkc =0, or, ∫ d4y (G−1(x − y)) ij Tjk(ϵ)φkc =0, or, (G−1(pμ =0)) ij Tjk(ϵ)φkc =0 . (11.125) We note that this system of equations will have a nontrivial solution (namely, at least one φic would be nontrivial, leading to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry) only if det (G−1 F (pμ =0)) ij =0 . (11.126) We recognize that (G−1(pμ =0))ij deﬁnes the complete (to all or- ders) mass matrix of the theory. Therefore, there must exist at least one massless particle in the theory for Eq. (11.125) to have a non- trivial solution. This proves the Goldstone theorem. 11.7 References A. Das, Lectures on Quantum Field Theory, World Scientiﬁc (2008). J.

Gauge theories are deﬁned to be theories with a local symmetry and the symmetry is based on some relevant symmetry group. As we have seen in the last chapter, in general, symmetries have important consequences and in the case of a local symmetry, the consequences are even more power- ful. However, along with beautiful structures, local invariances also bring in diﬃculties. For theories with simple local symmetries such as Maxwell’s theory, these diﬃculties can be handled with ease, but problems become quite severe when the relevant local symmetries are more complex such as a non-Abelian symmetry. In this case, the path integral description needs to be analyzed carefully. (Similar diﬃculties also manifest in the canonical quantization of such theo- ries.) In this chapter, we will start with Maxwell’s theory where the diﬃculties can be simply handled and then we will go into a detailed discussion of non-Abelian gauge theories within the context of the path integral formalism. 12.1 Maxwell theory Let us recall that the Lagrangian density for Maxwell’s theory is given by L = − 1 4 FμνF μν , (12.1) where the ﬁeld strength tensor, Fμν, describing the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds is deﬁned in terms of the vector potential Aμ as 263 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 274 264 12 Gauge theories Fμν = ∂μAν − ∂νAμ = −Fνμ . (12.2) As we know, Maxwell’s theory is invariant under gauge transfor- mations which are local transformations. Explicitly, under a local change of the vector potential by a gradient, Aμ(x) → Aμ(x)+ ∂μα(x) , (12.3) the ﬁeld strength tensor remains invariant Fμν = ∂μAν − ∂νAμ → ∂μ (Aν + ∂να(x)) − ∂ν (Aμ + ∂μα(x)) = ∂μAν − ∂νAμ = Fμν . (12.4) Namely, the physically observable electric and magnetic ﬁelds are not sensitive to a redeﬁnition of the vector potential by a gauge trans- formation. Since Maxwell’s equations can be described in terms of the ﬁeld strength tensors, the gauge transformation of Eq. (12.3) deﬁnes a symmetry (invariance) of the Maxwell theory. These are simple local gauge transformations belonging to the Abelian U (1) group and correspondingly, Maxwell’s theory is known as an Abelian gauge theory. For completeness, we note here that the gauge trans- formation of Eq. (12.3) can be written in terms of a local U (1) phase transformation as Aμ(x) → Aμ(x)+ i(∂μe−iα(x))eiα(x) = U (x)Aμ(x)U −1(x)+ i(∂μU (x))U −1(x) , (12.5) where U (x)= e−iα(x) ∈ U (1). (Here we have set the coupling con- stant to unity.) The gauge invariance, of course, restricts the structure of the theory (Lagrangian density) and leads to diﬃculties that can be seen as follows. Let us note that the canonical momenta conjugate to the ﬁeld variables Aμ can be calculated from the Lagrangian density Eq. (12.1) and take the forms January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 275 12.1 Maxwell theory 265 Πμ = ∂L ∂ ˙Aμ = −F 0μ , (12.6) which implies the constraint Π 0 = −F 00 =0 . (12.7) This is, in fact, a general feature of gauge theories, namely, the local invariance leads to constraints. As a result, the canonical quantization of such theories is nontrivial. However, we note that since Maxwell’s theory as well as physical quantities such as the ﬁeld strength tensor are invariant under the gauge transformation in Eq. (12.3), we can choose a gauge (a particular form of the vector potential deﬁned by the gauge choice) to work with. If we choose the gauge ∇ · A = 0 (Coulomb gauge), then the equations of motion ∂μF μν =0 , (12.8) lead to (for ν =0) ∂μF μ0 = ∂iF i0 =0, or,∂i (∂iA 0 − ∂0Ai) = −∇2A0 =0, or,A0 = A0 =0 . (12.9) On the other hand, if sources (charges and currents) are present, the gauge ∇ · A =0 , (12.10) would lead to (we assume LI = J μAμ) ∇2A0 = J 0, or,A0 = 1 ∇2 J 0 . (12.11) In either case, the true dynamics of the theory is, therefore, contained in the transverse physical degrees of freedom and the longitudinal (as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 276 266 12 Gauge theories well as the temporal) degrees of freedom can be expressed in terms of these. The canonical quantization can now be carried out, but we lose manifest Lorentz invariance in the process. Let us emphasize here that the ﬁnal result for the calculation of any amplitude in the canonical formalism remains manifestly Lorentz invariant. However, there is no manifest Lorentz invariance in the intermediate steps. We can ask what would happen if we were to treat the theory in the path integral formalism as opposed to the canonical formal- ism. Here we note that we can write the Lagrangian density for the Maxwelltheoryalsoas L = − 1 4 FμνF μν = 1 2 AμP μνAν + total derivatives , (12.12) where P μν = ημν□ − ∂μ∂ν , P μνP λ ν =(ημν□ − ∂μ∂ν) (δ λ ν □ − ∂ν∂λ) = ημλ□2 − ∂μ∂λ□ − ∂μ∂λ□ + ∂μ∂λ□ = □ (ημλ□ − ∂μ∂λ) = □P μλ . (12.13) With a suitable normalization P μν can be thought of as a projection operator. (P μν = 1 □ P μν is the normalized projection operator.) In fact,wenotethat ∂μP μν = ∂μ (ημν□ − ∂μ∂ν) =(∂ν□ − □∂ν)=0= ∂νP μν . (12.14) Therefore, this is the transverse projection operator which projects out the components of any vector transverse (perpendicular) to the gradient operator ∂μ. As a result, the inverse of P μν does not exist and the Green’s function and, therefore, the Feynman propagator of the theory cannot be deﬁned. This implies that if we were to apply January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 277 12.1 Maxwell theory 267 the path integral formalism naively, neither the generating functional will exist nor can we carry out perturbation theory. We note here that whenever the determinant of the matrix of highest derivatives in the Lagrangian density vanishes, the system is singular and contains constraints among the ﬁeld variables. In such a case, without any further input, the Cauchy initial value problem cannot be uniquely solved, simply because the Green’s function does not exist. As a consequence, we see that the naive canonical quanti- zation has unpleasant features in the case of Maxwell’s theory since the ﬁelds are constrained and the momentum corresponding to A0 vanishes. In a physical gauge such as the Coulomb gauge, we can solve for the constraints and quantize only the true dynamical degrees of freedom. However, in this process, we give up manifest Lorentz invariance since we single out the transverse degrees of freedom. We can, of course, take an alternative approach. Namely, since we realize that the diﬃculties in quantization arise because of the singular nature of the Lagrangian density, we could modify the theory to make it nonsingular. Let us consider, for example, the Lagrangian density (this formulation of the theory is due to Fermi and this gauge is known as the Feynman-Fermi gauge) L = − 1 4 FμνF μν − 1 2 (∂μAμ)2 + J μAμ , (12.15) where J μ represents a conserved current (the sources in Maxwell’s theory) ∂μJ μ =0 . (12.16) Here we have generalized Maxwell’s theory to include a conserved current. But more than that we have also added a term − 1 2 (∂μAμ)2 to Maxwell’s Lagrangian density. This term breaks gauge invariance and, consequently, leads to a nonsingular theory. But clearly this would appear to be diﬀerent from Maxwell’s theory. Therefore, at this point there is no justiﬁcation for adding this new term to the Lagrangian density. But to understand the issue better, let us look at the equation of motion following from the action in the present case January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 278 268 12 Gauge theories ∂μ ∂L ∂∂μAν − ∂L ∂Aν =0, or, − ∂μF μν − ∂ν(∂ · A) − J ν =0, or,∂μF μν + ∂ν(∂ · A)= −J ν . (12.17) Without the second term on the left hand side in Eq. (12.17), this is just Maxwell’s equations in the presence of conserved sources. If we now write out the left hand side, Eq. (12.17) takes the form ∂μ (∂μAν − ∂νAμ)+ ∂ν(∂ · A)= −J ν, or, □Aν = −J ν, or, □∂ · A = −∂ · J =0 . (12.18) An alternative way to see this is to note that if we take the divergence of the equations of motion in (12.17), we have ∂ν∂μF μν + □ (∂ · A)= −∂νJ ν, or, □ (∂ · A)=0 , (12.19) wherewehaveused theantisymmetryofthe ﬁeld strength tensor as well as the conservation of J μ. Thus we see that although the presence of the term − 1 2 χ2 in the Lagrangian density where χ = ∂ · A, (12.20) seems to modify the theory, χ is in reality a free ﬁeld and, therefore, the presence of this additional term in the Lagrangian density would not change the physics of Maxwell’s theory. Furthermore, we realize that if we restrict classically χ =0, at t =0 and January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 279 12.1 Maxwell theory 269 ∂χ ∂t =0, at t =0 , (12.21) then, Eq. (12.19) would determine that χ = 0 at all times and we get back our familiar Maxwell’s theory. Thus, classically we can think of Maxwell’s theory as described by the modiﬁed Lagrangian density of Eq. (12.15) with the supplementary condition ∂ · A =0 . (12.22) In the quantum theory, however, the ﬁeld variables, Aμ,are operators and Eq. (12.22) is hard to impose on the theory as an operator relation. One can think of imposing such a condition on the vector space of states to select out the physical Hilbert space, namely, ∂μAμ|phys⟩ =0 . (12.23) However, this, too, turns out to be too stringent a condition. This not only demands that certain kinds of photons are not present in the physical state, but it also requires that those photons cannot be emitted (created) either. Gupta and Bleuler weakened the supple- mentary condition on the physical states to have the form ∂μAμ (+)(x)|phys⟩ =0 , (12.24) where Aμ (+)(x) is the positive frequency part of the Maxwell’s ﬁeld and contains only the destruction operator. (This is commonly known as the Gupta-Bleuler quantization (condition).) We remark here that since (see Eq. (12.19)) □∂μAμ(x)=0 , (12.25) ∂μAμ(x) is like a free scalar ﬁeld. Therefore, it can be decomposed into positive and negative frequency parts uniquely in a relativis- tically invariant manner and this decomposition is preserved under time evolution. Furthermore, we note that the theory has four de- grees of freedom resulting from the four components of Aμ and since the components can be time-like or space-like, the resulting vector January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 280 270 12 Gauge theories space of states has the problem of a negative metric. On the other hand, the Gupta-Bleuler condition (12.24) selects out three kinds of photon states as being physical, two transverse photon states with a positive norm and a linear combination of the time-like and the longitudinal photon states with zero norm. The state with zero norm, however, is orthogonal to every other state (including itself) and, therefore, decouples from the theory and the physical Hilbert space eﬀectively consists of the physical transverse photon states. We can think of the Gupta-Bleuler supplementary condition as imposing the Lorenz condition ∂μAμ(x)=0 on the physical quantum states since it implies ⟨ψ|∂μAμ|ψ⟩ =0 , (12.26) where |ψ⟩ represents a physical state. Thus, we see that the physical subspace of the theory selected by the supplementary condition contains states with positive semi- deﬁnite norm (negative norm states are eliminated by the supple- mentary condition or the physical state condition and, consequently, there is no problem with a probabilistic interpretation). Since the zero norm states are orthogonal to all the states including themselves, if we further mod out the states by the zero norm states, we have the true physical subspace of the theory where the norm of states is positive deﬁnite, namely, V phys = Vphys V0 , (12.27) where V0 represents the set of states with zero norm. Since the modiﬁed theory in Eq. (12.15) (which is equivalent to Maxwell’s theory) is nonsingular, it can be described in the path integral formalism in the standard manner. In this simple gauge theory, therefore, there is an easy solution to the problem associated with the local invariance of the theory. As we will see in the next section, the diﬃculties become more severe in a non-Abelian gauge theory. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 281 12.2 Non-Abelian gauge theory 271 12.2 Non-Abelian gauge theory As we have mentioned earlier, non-Abelian gauge theories are based on nontrivial symmetry groups where the generators of the group satisfy a non-commutative Lie algebra. Let us take a brief digression into the structure of SU (n). If we assume that T a,a =1, 2, ··· ,n2 − 1(dim SU (n)) denote the generators of the group, then they satisfy the Lie algebra of the form (we take the generators to be Hermitian and repeated indices are summed) [T a,T b] = if abcT c , (12.28) where f abc denote the completely antisymmetric, real structure con- stants of the algebra. The Jacobi identity for the algebra is given by [[T a,T b] ,T c] + [[T c,T a] ,T b] + [[T b,T c] ,T a] =0 , (12.29) and imposes a restriction on the structure constants of the form if abp [T p,T c]+ if cap [T p,T b] + if bcp [T p,T a]=0, or,f abpf pcqT q + f capf pbqT q + f bcpf paqT q =0, or,f abpf pcq + f capf pbq + f bcpf paq =0 . (12.30) We can ﬁnd the forms of the generators in various represen- tations of the group much like in the case of angular momentum. However, a particular representation that is very important as well as useful in the study of gauge theories is given by (T a)bc = −if abc . (12.31) This is consistent with the hermiticity requirement for the generators (T a†) bc =((T a)cb)∗ = (−if acb)∗ = if acb = −if abc =(T a)bc . (12.32) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 282 272 12 Gauge theories Furthermore, we can easily check that this representation naturally satisﬁes the Lie algebra Eq. (12.28), [T a,T b] cq = (T aT b − T bT a) cq =(T a)cp (T b) pq − (T b) cp (T a)pq =(−if acp) (−if bpq) − (−if bcp) (−if apq) = −f acpf bpq + f bcpf apq = −f capf pbq − f bcpf paq = f abpf pcq (by Jacobi identity) = if abp (−if pcq) = if abp (T p)cq , (12.33) so that the identiﬁcation (T a (adj)) bc = −if abc , (12.34) indeed deﬁnes a representation of the Lie algebra known as the ad- joint representation. For any representation of a simple Lie group we can write Tr T aT b = C2δab , (12.35) where C2 is a normalization constant which determines the values of the structure constants. It depends on the representation but not on the indices a and b. To prove this let us note that we can always diagonalize the tensor Tr(T aT b) such that (this is a symmetric real matrix) Tr (T aT b) = { 0if a ̸= b, Ka if a = b. (12.36) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 283 12.2 Non-Abelian gauge theory 273 Let us next note that the quantity habc =Tr ([T a,T b] T c) =Tr (T aT bT c) − Tr (T bT aT c) , (12.37) is completely antisymmetric in all its indices. Furthermore, using the commutation relations in the deﬁnition in Eq. (12.37), we have habc =Tr ([T a,T b]T c) =Tr (if abpT pT c) = if abp Tr (T pT c) = if abpKpδpc = iKcf abc, (no sum on c) . (12.38) On the other hand, we note that hacb =Tr ([T a,T c] T b) = if acp Tr (T pT b) = if acpKpδpb = iKbf acb = −iKbf abc, (no sum on b) . (12.39) However, since habc is completely antisymmetric hacb = −habc . (12.40) Comparing the two results in Eqs. (12.38) and (12.39) we see that Kb = Kc = K. (12.41) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 284 274 12 Gauge theories (Alternatively, we note that Tr T aT b = Kaδab, Tr T bT a = Kbδab . (12.42) By cyclicity of the trace, the two must equal and hence we have Ka = Kb , (12.43) which proves Eq. (12.41).) In other words, we see that we can write Tr (T aT b) = C2δab , (12.44) where the constant C2 depends only on the representation. (It is cho- sen to be 1 2 for the fundamental representation to which the fermions belong in SU (n).) Wenotethatifwewrite Tr T aT b = T (R) δab , (12.45) then T (R) is known as the index of the representation R. Similarly, we have (T aT a)mn = C(R) δmn , (12.46) where C(R) is known as the Casimir of the representation R.The two are clearly related as T (R)dim G = C(R)dim R, (12.47) where dim G,dim R denote respectively the dimensionalities of the group G and the representation R. To construct a gauge theory with SU (n) symmetry, we note that the gauge potentials must belong to some representation of the symmetry group and, therefore, can be written as matrices. In fact, the gauge potentials can be expanded in terms of the generators of the Lie algebra (in some representation) as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 285 12.2 Non-Abelian gauge theory 275 Aμ(x)= T aAa μ(x) , (12.48) where summation over repeated indices is understood. The gauge transformation in Eq. (12.5) can now be generalized to (we are setting the coupling constant to unity) Aμ(x) → U (x)Aμ(x)U −1(x)+ i(∂μU (x))U −1(x) , (12.49) where, in the present case, U (x)= e−iα(x) = e−iαa(x)T a , (12.50) belongs to the non-Abelian group SU (n). Furthermore, since U and Aμ are now matrices, they do not commute in general and the ac- tual gauge transformation in Eq. (12.49) is much more complicated than (12.3). In fact, for the simple case of an inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation, Eq. (12.49) takes the form (here the parameter of transformation α(x)= ϵ(x) is assumed to be inﬁnitesimal) Aμ(x) → Aμ(x)+ i [Aμ(x),ϵ(x)] + ∂μϵ(x) = Aμ(x)+ Dμϵ(x) , (12.51) where we have deﬁned (coupling constant has been set to unity) Dμϵ(x)= ∂μϵ(x)+ i [Aμ(x),ϵ(x)] , (12.52) also known as the covariant derivative. To construct the Lagrangian density for the gauge ﬁeld in a gauge invariant manner, we note that under a gauge transforma- tion given by Eq. (12.49), the tensor representing the Abelian ﬁeld strength (see Eq. (12.2)) would transform as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 286 276 12 Gauge theories fμν = ∂μAν − ∂νAμ → ∂μ [UAνU −1 + i (∂νU ) U −1] − ∂ν [UAμU −1 + i (∂μU ) U −1] = i [(∂νU ) (∂μU −1) − (∂μU ) (∂νU −1)] +(∂μU ) AνU −1 + UAν (∂μU −1) − (∂νU ) AμU −1 − UAμ (∂νU −1) + U (∂μAν − ∂νAμ) U −1 . (12.53) Namely, unlike QED, in the present case, fμν = ∂μAν − ∂νAμ is not invariant under a gauge transformation. Let us also note that under a gauge transformation i [Aμ,Aν]= i (AμAν − AνAμ) → i [(UAμU −1 + i (∂μU ) U −1) , (UAνU −1 + i(∂νU )U −1)] = iU [Aμ,Aν] U −1 − i ((∂νU ) (∂μU −1) − (∂μU ) (∂νU −1)) − (∂μU ) AνU −1 − UAν (∂μU −1) +(∂νU ) AμU −1 + UAμ (∂νU −1) . (12.54) Thus, it is clear that, in the present case, if we deﬁne the ﬁeld strength tensor as (we are setting the coupling constant to unity) Fμν = ∂μAν − ∂νAμ + i [Aμ,Aν] , (12.55) then, under a ﬁnite gauge transformation, Fμν will transform covari- antly, namely, Fμν → U (∂μAν − ∂νAμ + i [Aμ,Aν]) U −1 = UFμνU −1 . (12.56) It is now easy to construct the Lagrangian density for the gauge ﬁeld as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 287 12.2 Non-Abelian gauge theory 277 Lgauge = − 1 2 Tr FμνF μν = − 1 4 F a μνF μν a , (12.57) where a particular normalization for the trace is assumed in the last relation (namely, T a’s are in the fundamental representation). This Lagrangian density is easily seen, from the cyclicity of trace, to be invariant under the gauge transformation Eq. (12.49) (see, for exam- ple, Eq. (12.56)). In components, the ﬁeld strength tensor takes the form, (we have set the coupling constant to unity for simplicity) F a μν = ∂μAa ν − ∂νAa μ − f abcAb μAc ν = −F a νμ . (12.58) In components, the inﬁnitesimal form of the transformation for the gauge ﬁelds in Eq. (12.51) take the forms δA a μ = A′a μ − Aa μ = (∂μϵa − f abcAb μϵc) = (∂μϵa + f bacAb μϵc) = (∂μϵa + i (−if bac) A b μϵc) = (∂μϵa + i (T b (adj)) ac A b μϵc) , (12.59) so that we can write δA a μ = (D(adj) μ ϵ)a = ∂μϵa − f abcAb μϵc , (12.60) which shows that the gauge ﬁeld, Aμ, transforms according to the adjoint representation of the group. The inﬁnitesimal transformation of the ﬁeld strength tensor can be obtained from Eq. (12.56) and leads to January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 288 278 12 Gauge theories δF a μν = −f abcF b μνϵc = −i (−if cab) ϵcF b μν = −i (T c (adj)) ab ϵcF b μν = −iϵc (T c (adj)) ab F b μν . (12.61) Thus, the ﬁeld strength tensor Fμν as well as the gauge ﬁeld Aμ transform according to the adjoint representation of the group. (It does not matter what representationt the matter ﬁelds belong to, the gauge ﬁeld must transform in the adjoint representation.) We note here that unlike the photon ﬁeld, here the gauge ﬁeld has self interaction. Physically we understand this in the following way. In the present case, the gauge ﬁeld carries the charge of the non-Abelian symmetry group (they have a nontrivial symmetry index) in contrast to the photon ﬁeld which is charge neutral. Since gauge ﬁelds couple to any particle carrying charge of the symmetry group, in the case of non-Abelian symmetry they must possess self interactions. Let us next brieﬂy examine the diﬃculties that arise in trying to canonically quantize the theory along the lines of Maxwell theory. The Euler-Lagrange equations following from Eq. (12.57) take the forms ∂ν ∂L ∂∂νAa μ − ∂L ∂Aa μ =0 or, (DνF μν)a =0 , (12.62) where the covariant derivative is deﬁned to be in the adjoint repre- sentation of the group and (coupling constant is unity) F a μν = ∂μAa ν − ∂νAa μ − f abcAb μAc ν . (12.63) For μ = 0, we see that the Euler-Lagrange equations lead to a con- straint of the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 289 12.2 Non-Abelian gauge theory 279 DiF 0ia =0 , (12.64) which is a reﬂection of the gauge invariance of the theory. In fact, it can be explicitly checked the coeﬃcient matrix of highest derivatives is the transverse projection operator just like in the Maxwell theory. Let us deﬁne the momenta canonically conjugate to the ﬁeld variables Aa μ Πμa(x)= ∂L ∂ ˙Aa μ(x) = −F 0μa(x) . (12.65) Noting that the ﬁeld strength F a μν is antisymmetric in the indices μ, ν,wehave Π0 a(x)= −F 00 a =0 , (12.66) and Πia(x)= −F 0ia = Ea i (x) , (12.67) wherewecan thinkof Ea i (x) as the non-Abelian electric ﬁeld strength. We note that the momentum conjugate to Aa 0 does not exist much like in the Maxwell theory. This implies that Aa 0 is like a c- number quantity which commutes with every other operator in the theory. Thus we can choose a physical gauge condition to suitably set it equal to zero, namely, Aa 0(x)=0 . (12.68) The analysis is parallel to what we have discussed in the case of Maxwell theory, although it is much more complicated. Barring tech- nical issues such as the Gribov ambiguity (related to the existence of large gauge transformations), the theory can also be deﬁned in terms of only physical transverse gauge ﬁelds in this case. Therefore, canonical quantization leads to a lack of manifest Lorentz invariance. We can try to quantize a non-Abelian gauge theory covariantly, very much along the lines of the Abelian theory, namely, by modifying the theory. Thus, for example, let us look at the theory January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 290 280 12 Gauge theories L = − 1 4 F a μνF μν a − 1 2 (∂μAμa)2 . (12.69) The additional term in this theory clearly breaks gauge invariance and, consequently, makes the theory nonsingular, much like in the Maxwell theory. However, in the present case, there are serious dif- ferences from Maxwell’s theory. For example, let us note that in the Abelian theory, □(∂ · A)=0 , (12.70) and hence classically we can impose the condition ∂ · A =0 , (12.71) which then leads to the Gupta-Bleuler condition on the physical states ∂ · A(+)|phys⟩ =0 . (12.72) In the case of the non-Abelian theory, however, even classically the equations of motion are given by (DμF μν)a + ∂ν(∂μAμa)=0, or,∂μF μν a − f abcAb μF μν c + ∂ν (∂μA μa)=0 . (12.73) Contracting with ∂ν, we obtain □ (∂μAμa)= f abc∂ν (Ab μF μν c) ̸=0 . (12.74) Thus, in contrast to the Abelian theory, we note that (∂μAμa)does not behave like a free ﬁeld and, consequently, the additional term has truly modiﬁed the theory. Furthermore, since (∂μAμa) is not a free ﬁeld, it cannot be uniquely decomposed into a positive and a January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 291 12.3 Path integral for gauge theories 281 negative frequency part (in a time invariant manner), nor can we think of a supplementary condition such as ∂μAμa(+)|phys⟩ =0 , (12.75) in a physically meaningful manner, since it is not invariant under time evolution. (Namely, the physical subspace would keep chang- ing with time which is not desirable.) Correspondingly the analog of the Gupta-Bleuler condition for non-Abelian gauge theories does not appear to exist. Therefore, we need to analyze the question of modifying the theory in a more systematic and detailed manner. We would see next how we can derive intuition on this important question from the path integral quantization. 12.3 Path integral for gauge theories To understand better how gauge theories can be handled in the path integral formalism, let us go back to the Maxwell theory described by the Lagrangian density L(J) = − 1 4 FμνF μν + J μAμ , (12.76) where J μ represents a conserved current (source). The generating functional in the path integral formalism is given by (in Eqs. (12.12) and (12.13), we have denoted Oμν by P μν) Z [Jμ]= eiW [Jμ] = N ∫ DAμeiS(J)[Aμ] = N ∫ DAμ ei[ 1 2 (Aμ,Oμν Aν )+(J μ,Aμ)] , where N is a normalization constant and Oμν(x − y)=(□ημν − ∂μ∂ν) δ4(x − y) , (J μ,Aμ)= ∫ d4xJ μ(x)Aμ(x), (Aμ,OμνAν)= ∫ d4xd4yAμ(x)Oμν(x − y)Aν(y) . (12.77) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 292 282 12 Gauge theories Here we have introduced a compact notation to describe integrations as described above. The functional integral is a Gaussian integral which we have worked out in earlier chapters and leads to Z [Jμ]= eiW [Jμ] = N (det (−Oμν))− 1 2 e− i 2 (J μ,O−1 μν J ν) . (12.78) However, as we have seen before (see Eq. (12.13)), the operator Oμν is a projection operator for transverse photons. The longitudinal vectors kμ (or ∂μF ) are its eigenvectors with zero eigenvalue. Clearly therefore, the determinant of Oμν vanishes. This implies that the generating functional does not exist. (The operator possesses zero modes and, consequently, the inverse of the matrix cannot be deﬁned either.) Going over to the Euclidean space does not help either. In fact, as we can see even in the limit of vanishing sources, the generating functional does not exist. The source of the diﬃculty is not hard to see. The Lagrangian density for Maxwell’s theory is invariant under the gauge transfor- mation Aμ → A(α) μ = UAμU −1 + i(∂μU )U −1 , (12.79) where U (α)= e−iα(x) . (12.80) For a ﬁxed Aμ,all the A (α) μ ’s that are obtained by making gauge transformations with all possible α(x) are said to lie on an “orbit” in the group space. The action S, on the other hand, is constant (invariant) on such orbits. Therefore, the generating functional, even in the absence of any sources, is proportional to the “volume” of the orbits denoted by ∫ ∏ x dα(x) . (12.81) (In the non-Abelian case, the measure should be replaced by the group invariant Haar measure ∏x dU (x).) This is an inﬁnite factor January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 293 12.3 Path integral for gauge theories 283 (which is the reason why the Gaussian functional integral does not exist) and must be extracted out before doing any calculations. The method for extracting this factor out of the path integral is due to Faddeev and Popov and relies on the method of gauge ﬁxing. We recognize that we should not integrate over all gauge ﬁeld conﬁgura- tions because they are not really distinct. Rather we should integrate over each orbit only once. The way this is carried out is by choosing a hypersurface which intersects each orbit only once, i.e., if F (Aμ)=0 , (12.82) deﬁnes the hypersurface which intersects the orbits once, then even if Aμ does not satisfy the condition, we can ﬁnd a gauge transformed A(α) μ which does, namely, F (A (α) μ ) =0 , (12.83) has a unique solution for α(x). This procedure is known as gauge ﬁxing and the condition F (Aμ)=0 , (12.84) is known as the gauge condition. Physical quantities are, of course, gauge independent and do not depend on the choice of the hypersur- face (gauge). Thus, for example, F (Aμ)= ∂μAμ = 0 is the Lorenz/Landau gauge, ∇ · A = 0 is the Coulomb gauge, A0 = 0 is the temporal gauge, A3 = 0 is the axial gauge, (12.85) and so on. We can already see the need for gauge ﬁxing from the fact that because the action is gauge invariant so is the generating functional (if sources are transformed appropriately). Therefore, it January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 294 284 12 Gauge theories would lead only to gauge invariant Green’s functions. On the other hand, we know from ordinary perturbation theory that the Green’s functions are, in general, gauge dependent although the S-matrix (the scattering matrix) elements are gauge independent. Thus one has to ﬁx a gauge without which even the Cauchy initial value prob- lem cannot be solved. (Only physical quantities need to be gauge independent.) To extract out the inﬁnite gauge volume factor, let us do the following trick due to Faddeev and Popov. Let us deﬁne ΔFP [Aμ] ∫ ∏ x dα(x) δ (F (A(α) μ (x))) =1 . (12.86) (The integration measure should be dU (x), the Haar measure, which is essential in the case of non-Abelian theories.) Note that the quan- tity ΔFP [Aμ] is gauge invariant which can be seen from the fact that Δ−1 FP [Aμ]= ∫ ∏ x dα(x) δ (F (A(α) μ (x))) . (12.87) Let us make a gauge transformation Aμ → A(α′) μ . Then, Δ−1 FP [A (α′) μ ] = ∫ ∏ x dα(x) δ (F (A(α+α′) μ (x))) = ∫ ∏ x dα(x) δ (F (A(α) μ (x))) =Δ−1 FP [Aμ] . (12.88) This follows from the fact that the measure in the group space is invariant under a gauge transformation. That is ∫ dα(x)= ∫ d (α(x)+ α′(x)) . (12.89) In the non-Abelian case, we should use the Haar measure which is gauge invariant, namely, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 295 12.3 Path integral for gauge theories 285 ∫ d(UU ′)= ∫ dU. (12.90) Remembering that ΔFP [Aμ] is gauge invariant we can now in- sert this identity factor into the generating functional to write Z[J]= N ∫ DAμ ( ΔFP [Aμ] ∫ ∏ x dα(x)δ(F (A (α) μ )) ) eiS(J)[Aμ] . (12.91) Furthermore, let us make an inverse gauge transformation Aμ → A(−α) μ , (12.92) under which the generating functional takes the form Z[J]= N ∫ DAμΔFP [Aμ] ∫ ∏ x dα(x) δ (F (Aμ)) eiS(J)[Aμ] = N (∫ ∏ x dα(x) ) ∫ DAμΔFP [Aμ] δ (F (Aμ)) eiS(J)[Aμ] = N ∫ DAμΔFP [Aμ] δ (F (Aμ)) eiS(J)[Aμ], (12.93) where the gauge volume has been factored and absorbed into the normalization constant N of the path integral. This, therefore, gives the correct functional form for the gener- ating functional. However, we still have to determine what ΔFP [Aμ] is. To do this let us note that Δ−1 FP [Aμ]= ∫ ∏ x dα(x) δ (F (A(α) μ )) = ∫ ∏ x dFδ (F (A (α) μ )) (det δα δF ) =det ( δα δF ) F (A(α) μ )=0 . (12.94) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 296 286 12 Gauge theories We note that since Δ−1 FP [Aμ] is gauge invariant we can make an in- verse gauge transformation to make F [Aμ]=0 in the above deriva- tion. On the other hand, for gauge ﬁelds which satisfy the condition F (Aμ)=0 , (12.95) we have α(x)=0 . (12.96) Thus, we determine ΔFP [Aμ]=det ⎛ ⎝ δF (A(α) μ ) δα ⎞ ⎠ α=0 . (12.97) The Faddeev-Popov determinant can, therefore, be thought of as the Jacobian that goes with a particular gauge choice. We see that the Faddeev-Popov determinant can be calculated simply by restricting to inﬁnitesimal gauge transformations. (Here we are completely ig- noring the problem of Gribov ambiguity associated with large gauge transformations.) We can further generalize our derivation by noting that a gen- eral equation of the hypersurface has the form (physical results are not sensitive to the choice of the hypersurface) F (Aμ(x)) = f (x) . (12.98) Here f (x) is independent of Aμ. Then we can insert the identity ΔFP [Aμ] ∫ ∏ x dα(x) δ (F (A(α) μ (x)) − f (x)) =1 , (12.99) into the functional integral. The Faddeev-Popov determinant is un- changed by this modiﬁcation because f (x) does not depend on Aμ(x). Thus the generating functional in this case is given by January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 297 12.3 Path integral for gauge theories 287 Z [J]= N ∫ DAμΔFP [Aμ] δ (F (Aμ(x)) − f (x)) eiS(J)[Aμ]. (12.100) Using the ’t Hooft trick, we can now do the following. We note that physical quantities are independent of f (x). Hence we can multiply the generating functional by a weight factor and integrate over all f (x). Thus, the generating functional becomes Z [J]= N ∫ DAμΔFP [Aμ] ∫ Dfδ (F (Aμ(x)) − f (x)) × e− i 2ξ ∫ d4x(f (x))2eiS(J) = N ∫ DAμΔFP [Aμ] ei[S(J)− 1 2ξ ∫ d4x(F (Aμ(x)))2] = N ∫ DAμΔFP [Aμ] ei(S(J)+SGF), where SGF = ∫ d4x LGF = − 1 2ξ ∫ d4x (F (Aμ(x)))2 , (12.101) and ξ is known as the gauge ﬁxing parameter. We furthermore, note that since ΔFP [Aμ]=det ⎛ ⎝ δF (A(α) μ ) δα ⎞ ⎠ α=0 , (12.102) we can write this as ΔFP [Aμ]=det ( δF (Aα μ(x)) δα(y) ) α=0 = ∫ DcDce−i(c,( δF δα )α=0c) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 298 288 12 Gauge theories = ∫ DcDce−i ∫ d4xd4y c(x) ( δF(Aα μ (x)) δα(y) ) α=0c(y) = ∫ DcDceiSghost, (12.103) where Sghost = − ∫ d4xd4y c(x) ( δF (Aα μ(x)) δα(y) ) α=0 c(y). (12.104) Here we have introduced two independent ﬁctitious ﬁelds c(x)and c(x) to write the determinant in the form of an action. We note here that, for Eq. (12.103) to hold, the ghost ﬁelds c(x)and c(x) have to anti-commute (ghosts have the same Lorentz structure as the parameters of transformation, but opposite statistics), i.e., [c(x),c(y)]+ =0 , [c(x), c(y)]+ =0 , [c(x), c(y)]+ =0 . (12.105) Thus although these behave as scalar objects under Lorentz transfor- mations, they obey anti-commutation rules. These ﬁelds are known as Faddeev-Popov ghosts and, as is obvious from their anti- commutation relations, graphs involving these ﬁctitious particles in closed loops must have an additional (−1) factor just like the fermions. Thus the generating functional now takes the form Z [J]= eiW [J] = N ∫ DAμDcDceiS(J) eﬀ [Aμ,c,c] , (12.106) where S(J) eﬀ [Aμ,c, c]= S(J) [Aμ]+ SGF + Sghost = ∫ d4x L(J) eﬀ [Aμ,c, c] . (12.107) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 299 12.3 Path integral for gauge theories 289 Let us now look at a simple gauge ﬁxing condition, for example, the covariant condition F (Aμ)= ∂μAμ(x)= f (x) . (12.108) Clearly the gauge ﬁxing Lagrangian density has the form LGF = − 1 2ξ (F (Aμ(x)))2 = − 1 2ξ (∂μAμ(x))2 . (12.109) It is clear that this provides longitudinal components to the quadratic terms in ﬁelds and hence breaks gauge invariance. To obtain the corresponding ghost Lagrangian density for this gauge choice, we note that F (A (α) μ ) = ∂μAμ(α)(x)= ∂μ (Aμ + ∂μα(x)) , (12.110) so that δF (A(α) μ (x)) δα(y) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣α=0 = □xδ4(x − y) . (12.111) In this case, the ghost action is obtained to be Sghost = − ∫ d4xd4y c(x) δF (Aα μ(x)) δα(y) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣α=0 c(y) = − ∫ d4xd4y c(x) (□xδ4(x − y)) c(y) = ∫ d4x∂μc(x)∂μc(x)= ∫ d4x Lghost, (12.112) where we have neglected total divergence terms. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 300 290 12 Gauge theories Thus our eﬀective Lagrangian density for this choice of gauge condition becomes Leﬀ = − 1 4 FμνF μν − 1 2ξ (∂μAμ)2 +∂μc(x)∂μc(x)+J μAμ . (12.113) We note here that the ghost ﬁelds are noninteracting in the case of the Abelian theory and, therefore, we may omit them and then for ξ =1 our eﬀective Lagrangian density coincides with Maxwell’s theory in the Feynman-Fermi gauge (see Eq. (12.15)). In non-Abelian gauge theories, however, the ghost ﬁelds are interacting and have to be present. Furthermore, since these ﬁelds are really necessary for the unitarity of the S-matrix, we cannot neglect them even if they are noninteracting if we are doing calculations at ﬁnite temperature. It is also true that when Maxwell’s theory is coupled to gravitational ﬁelds, the ghost ﬁelds automatically couple to the geometry also. Hence omitting the ghost Lagrangian density in such a case would lead to nonsensical results. One way of looking at the ghost ﬁelds is as if they are there to subtract out the unphysical ﬁeld degrees of freedom. For exam- ple, the Aμ ﬁeld has four helicity components. On the other hand each of the ghost ﬁelds, being a scalar, has only one helicity com- ponent. Hence one can think of the eﬀective Lagrangian density as having only two helicity states (4 − 2 × 1 = 2). This naive counting works pretty well as we will see later. (The ghost degrees of freedom subtract because they have the unphysical statistics.) Let us now apply these ideas of path integral quantization to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories. Let us recall from our study in the Abelian theory that gauge invariance puts a very strong con- straint on the structure of the Lagrangian density for the gauge ﬁeld. In particular, the coeﬃcient matrix of the quadratic terms in the La- grangian density is singular and, therefore, non-invertible. As a re- sult, if we take Linv as describing the dynamics of the theory, then, we cannot deﬁne propagators and the entire philosophy of doing pertur- bative calculations with Feynman diagrams breaks down. In order to circumvent this diﬃculty, we add to the gauge invariant Lagrangian density a term which breaks gauge invariance and thereby allows us to deﬁne the propagator for the gauge ﬁeld. Such a term is called a gauge ﬁxing term and any term which makes the coeﬃcient ma- trix of the quadratic terms nonsingular and maintains various global January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 301 12.3 Path integral for gauge theories 291 symmetries of the theory is allowed for this purpose. On the other hand, adding a gauge ﬁxing Lagrangian density changes the theory, in general, and to compensate for that we have to add a Lagrangian density for the ghost ﬁelds following the prescription of Faddeev and Popov. In the case of the non-Abelian gauge theory, as we have seen, the Lagrangian density for the gauge ﬁelds Linv = − 1 4 F a μνF μνa , (12.114) is invariant under the inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation A a μ(x) → A(ϵ)a μ (x)= Aa μ(x)+ Dμϵa(x) , (12.115) where ϵa(x) is the inﬁnitesimal parameter of transformation and Dμϵa(x)= ∂μϵa(x) − f abcAb μ(x)ϵc(x), F a μν(x)= ∂μAa ν(x) − ∂νAa μ(x) − f abcAb μAc ν . (12.116) The standard covariant gauge ﬁxing, in a non-Abelian gauge theory, consists of adding to the invariant Lagrangian density a term of the form LGF = − 1 2ξ (∂μAμa)2 , (12.117) which would correspond to a gauge ﬁxing condition of the form F a[A]= ∂μAμa(x)= f a(x) . (12.118) Here ξ represents an arbitrary constant parameter known as the gauge ﬁxing parameter. Following the prescription of Faddeev and Popov (see Eq. (12.104)), we can write the ghost action correspond- ing to this gauge choice as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 302 292 12 Gauge theories Sghost = ∫ dx Lghost = − ∫ dxdy ca(x) δF a[A(α)(x)] δαb(y) ∣ ∣ ∣α=0cb(y) . (12.119) Here we have left the dimensionality of space-time arbitrary since our discussions apply in any dimension. We note that for the covariant gauge choice that we are assuming, we can write (we can think of αa = ϵa as inﬁnitesimal since we are taking αa = 0 at the end) F a[A(α)(x)] = ∂μA(α)a μ = ∂μ (A a μ(x)+(Dμα)a(x)) . (12.120) Consequently, the ghost Lagrangian density, for this choice of gauge ﬁxing, follows to be Lghost = − ∫ dy ca(x) (∂μ x Dab μ,xδ(x − y)) cb(y) = − (Dμ (∂μc))a (x)ca(x) = ∂μca(x)(Dμc(x))a , (12.121) wherewehavedropped atotal derivative term in thelastlineofthe above equation and have identiﬁed Dab μ,x = δab∂μ,x − f acbAc μ(x) , (12.122) which leads to (the ghosts are in the adjoint representation) (Dμc)a = Dab μ,xcb = ∂μca − f acbAc μcb = ∂μca − f abcAb μcc . (12.123) With all these modiﬁcations, the total Lagrangian density for a non-Abelian gauge theory has the form LTOT = Linv + LGF + Lghost , (12.124) which, in the covariant gauge that we are considering, is given by January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 303 12.4 BRST symmetry 293 LTOT = − 1 4 F a μνF μνa − 1 2ξ (∂μAμa)2 + ∂μca (Dμc)a . (12.125) The path integral can now be deﬁned with this LTOT and will be well behaved. 12.4 BRST symmetry As we have mentioned earlier, the gauge ﬁxing and the ghost La- grangian densities modify the original theory in a compensating man- ner which allows us to deﬁne the Feynman rules of the theory and carry out any perturbative calculation. In a deeper sense, the gauge ﬁxing and the ghost Lagrangian densities, in the path integral for- mulation, merely correspond to a multiplicative factor of unity which does not change the physical content of the theory. However, with- out going into too much technical details, we can see that these additional terms in the Lagrangian density have no physical content in the following way. The total Lagrangian density has been gauge ﬁxed and, there- fore, does not have the gauge invariance of the original theory. How- ever, the total Lagrangian density, with gauge ﬁxing and ghost terms, develops a global fermionic symmetry which, in some sense, remem- bers the gauge invariance of the original theory. It is easy to check that the total action is invariant under the global transformations δA a μ = ω (Dμc)a , δca = ω 2 f abccbcc, δca = − ω ξ (∂μAμa) , (12.126) where ω is the constant anti-commuting parameter of the global transformations (ω2 = 0). The invariance of the action can be seen by ﬁrst noting that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 304 294 12 Gauge theories δ (Dμca)=(Dμδc)a − f abcδA b μcc = ω 2 Dμ (f abccbcc) − ωf abc (Dμcb) cc =0 , δ ( 1 2 f abccbcc) = f abcδcbcc = ω 2 f abcf bpqcpcqcc = ω 6 (f abcf bpq + f abpf bqc + f abqf bcp) cpcqcc =0 . (12.127) Here we have used the Jacobi identity for the symmetry algebra (see Eqs. (12.29) and (12.30)). Similarly, we obtain δ (∂μAμa)= ω∂μ(Dμc)a =0 , (12.128) when the ghost equations of motion are used. This shows that δ2δ1φa =0 , (12.129) for φa = Aa μ,ca, ca,where δ1,2 correspond to transformations with parameters ω1,2 respectively. We note that the nilpotency of the transformations holds oﬀ-shell only for the ﬁelds Aa μ,ca, while for ca it is true only on-shell (when the ghost equations of motion are used). The invariance of the action can now be easily checked. First, we note that the transformation for Aa μ is really an inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation with the parameter αa = ωca and, therefore, the invariant Lagrangian density is trivially invariant under these trans- formations, namely, δLinv =0 . (12.130) Consequently, we need to worry only about the gauge ﬁxing and the ghost Lagrangian densities which lead to January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 305 12.4 BRST symmetry 295 δ (LGF + Lghost)= − 1 ξ (∂νAνa) (∂μδA a μ) +(∂μδca)(Dμc)a = − ω ξ (∂νAνa) ∂μ(Dμc)a − ω ξ ∂μ (∂νAνa)(Dμc)a = −∂μ ( ω ξ (∂νAνa)(Dμc)a) , (12.131) so that the action is invariant. In this derivation, we have used the fact that δ (Dμca) = 0 which we have seen earlier in Eq. (12.127). This shows that the total action is invariant under the global trans- formations with an anti-commuting constant parameter. This is known as the BRST (Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin) transformation for a gauge theory and arises in the presence the gauge ﬁxing and the ghost Lagrangian densities. The present formulation of the BRST symmetry, however, is slightly unpleasant in the sense that the nilpo- tency of the anti-ghost ﬁeld transformation holds only on-shell. This is a reﬂection of the fact that the theory is lacking some auxiliary ﬁelds and once the correct auxiliary ﬁelds are incorporated, the sym- metry algebra will close oﬀ-shell. We can write the gauge ﬁxing Lagrangian density by introduc- ing an auxiliary ﬁeld which will also be quite useful for our later discussions. Let us rewrite LGF = ∂μF aAa μ + ξ 2 F aF a , (12.132) where F a is an auxiliary ﬁeld. It is clear from the form of LGF that the equation of motion for the auxiliary ﬁeld takes the form ξF a = ∂μAa μ, (12.133) and when we eliminate F a using this equation, we recover the origi- nal gauge ﬁxing Lagrangian density (if we ignore a total divergence term). Among other things, LGF as written above, allows us to take such gauge choices as the Landau gauge which corresponds to sim- ply taking the limit ξ = 0. The total Lagrangian density can now be written as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 306 296 12 Gauge theories LTOT = Linv + LGF + Lghost = − 1 4 F a μνF μνa + ∂μF aAa μ + ξ 2 F aF a + ∂μcaDμca . (12.134) In this case, the BRST transformations take the form δA a μ = ω (Dμc)a , δca = ω 2 f abccbcc , δca = −ωF a, δF a =0 , (12.135) and it is straightforward to check that these transformations are all nilpotent oﬀ-shell, namely, δ2δ1φa =0 , (12.136) for φa = Aa μ,F a,ca, ca. Therefore, F a represents the missing auxil- iary ﬁeld that we had alluded to earlier. We note that Linv is invariant under the BRST transformation as we had argued earlier and the auxiliary ﬁeld, F a, does not trans- form at all which leads to δLTOT = δ (LGF + Lghost) = ∂μF aδA a μ + ∂μδca (Dμc)a = ω∂μF a (Dμc)a − ω∂μF a (Dμc)a =0 . (12.137) Unlike the formulation without auxiliary ﬁelds, here we see that the total Lagrangian density is invariant under the BRST transforma- tions (as opposed to changing by a total divergence). These transformations, known as BRST transformations, which deﬁne a residual global symmetry of the full theory, in some sense, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 307 12.4 BRST symmetry 297 replace the original gauge invariance of the theory, and play a fun- damental role in the study of non-Abelian gauge theories. There is also a second set of transformations involving the anti-ghost ﬁelds of the form δA a μ = ω (Dμc)a , δca = ω (F a − f abccbcc) , δca = ω 2 f abccbcc , δF a = ωf abcF bcc , (12.138) which leave the total Lagrangian density invariant. These are known as the anti-BRST transformations. However, since these do not lead to any new information beyond what the BRST invariance provides, we will ignore this symmetry for the rest of our discussions. We note here that the BRST and the anti-BRST transformations are not quite symmetric in the ghost and the anti-ghost ﬁelds which is a reﬂection of the asymmetric nature of these ﬁelds in the ghost Lagrangian density. It is also worth noting here that these symmetries arise naturally in a superspace formulation of gauge theories. In addition to these two anti-commuting symmetries, the total Lagrangian density is also invariant under the inﬁnitesimal bosonic global symmetry transformations δca = ϵca , δca = −ϵca , (12.139) with all other ﬁelds remaining inert. Here ϵ represents a constant, bosonic inﬁnitesimal parameter and the generator of the symmetry merely counts the ghost number of the ﬁelds. (The fact that these transformations are like scale transformations and not like phase transformations has to do with the particular hermiticity properties that the ghost and the anti-ghost ﬁelds must satisfy for consistent quantization of the theory.) The vector space of the full theory, as is clear by now, con- tains many more states than the physical states alone. The physical January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 308 298 12 Gauge theories Hilbert space, therefore, needs to be properly selected for a discus- sion of physical questions. Furthermore, the physical space must be selected in such a way that it remains invariant under the time evo- lution of the system. In the covariant gauge in QED, for example, we have seen that the states in the physical space are selected as satisfying the Gupta-Bleuler condition ∂μA(+) μ (x)|phys⟩ =0 , (12.140) where the superscript, (+), stands for the positive frequency part of the ﬁeld. We recognize that even though this looks like one con- dition, in reality it is an inﬁnite number of conditions since it has to hold for every value of the space-time coordinates. In QED, the Gupta-Bleuler condition works because ∂μAμ satisﬁes the free Klein- Gordon equation in the covariant gauge and hence the physical space so selected remains invariant under time evolution. The correspond- ing operator in a non-Abelian theory, on the other hand, does not satisfy a free equation as we have seen and hence is not suitable for identifying the physical subspace. On the other hand, the generators of the BRST symmetry, QBRST, and the ghost scaling symmetry, Qc, are conserved and hence can be used to deﬁne a physical Hilbert space which would remain invariant under the time evolution of the system. (QBRST and Qc are the charges constructed from the N¨other current for the respective transformations whose explicit forms can be obtained from the N¨other procedure.) Thus, we can identify the physical space of the gauge theory as satisfying QBRST|phys⟩ =0 , Qc|phys⟩ =0 . (12.141) Note that even in the case of QED, these would appear to correspond to only two conditions and not an inﬁnite number of conditions as we have seen is the case with the Gupta-Bleuler condition. It is, there- fore, not clear a priori if these conditions are suﬃcient to reproduce the Gupta-Bleuler conditions in the case of QED. To see that these conditions do indeed lead to the Gupta-Bleuler conditions in QED, let us note that the N¨other current associated with the BRST transformations has the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 309 12.4 BRST symmetry 299 J (ω)μ BRST = −F μνaδA a ν + δca(Dμc)a +(∂μca) δca = −ω (F μνa(Dνc)a + F a(Dμc)a + 1 2 f abc (∂μca) cbcc) , (12.142) where we have used the fact that the auxiliary ﬁeld does not trans- form under the BRST transformations. From this, we can obtain the current without the parameter of transformations J μ BRST = F μνa(Dνc)a + F a(Dμc)a + 1 2 f abc (∂μca) cbcc , (12.143) and, in particular, for the Abelian theory where f abc = 0, the BRST charge can be obtained to be (dx denotes integration over all space coordinates) QBRST = ∫ dx (F 0ν∂νc + F∂0c) = ∫ dx (F 0i∂ic + F ˙c) = ∫ dx (∂i(F 0ic) − (∂iF 0i)c + F ˙c) = ∫ dx (−(∂0F )c + ∫ dx F ˙c) = ∫ dx F ←→ ∂0 c, (12.144) where we have discarded the surface terms and used Maxwell’s equa- tions in the intermediate steps. If we use the ﬁeld decomposition for the ﬁelds and normal order the BRST charge (so that the anni- hilation operators are to the right), this has the explicit form (dk denotes integration over all space components of the momentum) QBRST = i ∫ dk (c(−)(−k)F (+)(k) − F (−)(−k)c(+)(k)) . (12.145) We recognize that the condition January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 310 300 12 Gauge theories Qc|phys⟩ =0 , (12.146) implies that the physical states must have zero ghost number. This allows, in principle, states containing equal numbers of ghost and anti-ghost particles. Denoting the physical states of the theory as |phys⟩ = |Aμ⟩⊗|c, c⟩ , (12.147) we note that if the physical states have to further satisfy the condition QBRST|phys⟩ = i ∫ dk (c(−)(−k)F (+)(k) − F (−)(−k)c(+)(k)) ×|Aμ⟩⊗|c, c⟩ =0 , (12.148) then this implies that c(+)(k)|c, c⟩ =0= F (+)(k)|Aμ⟩ . (12.149) Namely, the physical states should have no ghost particles (remember zero ghost number), |phys⟩ = |Aμ⟩⊗|0, 0⟩ = |Aμ⟩ , (12.150) and must satisfy F (+)(k)|phys⟩ = (kμAμ(+)(k)) |phys⟩ =0 , (12.151) where we have used the equation of motion for the auxiliary ﬁeld. This is precisely the Gupta-Bleuler condition in momentum space and this derivation shows how a single condition can give rise to an inﬁnite number of conditions (in this case, for every momentum mode k). Thus, we feel conﬁdent that the physical state conditions are the right ones even for a non-Abelian theory. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 311 12.4 BRST symmetry 301 We are now ready to show that the gauge ﬁxing and the ghost Lagrangian densities lead to no physical consequences. We note that these extra terms in the Lagrangian density can, in fact, be writ- ten as a BRST variation (without the parameter of transformation), namely, LGF + Lghost = δ (−∂μcaAa μ − ξ 2 caF a) = [QBRST, (−∂μcaA a μ − ξ 2 caF a)] + . (12.152) Here we have used the fact that the BRST charge is the generator of the BRST transformations so that the transformations for fermionic operators are generated through the anti-commutator of the opera- tors with the generator. It now follows from the physical condition that ⟨phys| (LGF + Lghost) |phys′⟩ = −⟨phys| [QBRST, (∂μcaAa μ + ξ 2 caF a)] + |phys′⟩ =0 . (12.153) This shows that the terms added to the original Lagrangian density have no contribution to the physical matrix elements of the theory. We can also show that all the physical matrix elements are indepen- dent of the choice of the gauge ﬁxing parameter ξ in the following manner (the BRST variation denoted is without the parameter of transformation) ∂ ∂ξ ⟨0|0⟩J = ∂Z[J] ∂ξ = i 2 ⟨0| ∫ d4xF aF a|0⟩J = − i 2 ∫ d4x ⟨0|δ (caF a) |0⟩J = − i 2 ∫ d4x ⟨0| [QBRST, caF a]+ |0⟩J =0 , (12.154) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 312 302 12 Gauge theories where we have used the fact that the vacuum belongs to the physical Hilbert space of the theory and as such is annihilated by the BRST charge. 12.5 Ward identities The BRST invariance of the full theory leads to many relations be- tween various scattering amplitudes of the theory. These are known as the Ward identities or the Slavnov-Taylor identities of the theory and are quite essential in establishing the renormalizability of gauge theories. These identities are best described within the context of path integrals which we will do next. Let us consider an eﬀective Lagrangian density which consists of LTOT as well as source terms as follows Leﬀ = LTOT + J μaAa μ + J aF a + i (ηaca − caηa) + Kμa (Dμc)a + Ka ( 1 2 f abccbcc) . (12.155) Here, we have not only introduced sources for all the ﬁeld variables in the theory, but, in addition, we have also added sources for the com- posite variations under the BRST transformation (see Eq. (12.135)). The need for this will become clear shortly. Denoting all the ﬁelds and the sources generically by A and J respectively, we can write the generating functional for the theory as Z[J]= eiW [J] = N ∫ DAei ∫ dx Leﬀ . (12.156) The vacuum expectation values of operators, in the presence of sources, cannow be writtenas ⟨Aa μ⟩ = A(c)a μ = δW δJ μa , ⟨F a⟩ = F (c)a = δW δJ a , ⟨ca⟩ = c(c)a = −i δW δηa , ⟨ca⟩ = c(c)a = −i ∂W δηa , January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 313 12.5 Ward identities 303 ⟨(Dμc)a⟩ = δW δKμa , 〈 1 2 f abccbcc〉 = δW δKa . (12.157) Here, we have assumed the convention of a left derivative for the anti- commuting ﬁelds. The ﬁelds A(c) are known as the classical ﬁelds and in what follows, we will ignore the superscript (c) for notational simplicity. When the external sources are held ﬁxed, the eﬀective Lagrangian density is no longer invariant under the BRST transformations. In fact, recalling that LTOT is BRST invariant and that the BRST transformations are nilpotent, we obtain the change in Leﬀ (remem- ber that the parameter is anti-commuting) to be δLeﬀ = J μaδA a μ + J aδF a + i (ηaδca − δcaηa) = ω [J μa (Dμc)a + i (− 1 2 f abcηacbcc + F aηa)] . (12.158) On the other hand, the generating functional is deﬁned by integrating over all possible ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Therefore, with a redeﬁnition of the ﬁelds under a BRST transformation inside the path integral, the generating functional should be invariant. This immediately leads to δZ[J]=0= N ∫ DA (i ∫ d4xδLeﬀ ) ei ∫ d4x Leﬀ = iω ∫ d4x ( J μa⟨(Dμc)a⟩− iηa 〈 1 2 f abccbcc〉 + iηa⟨F a⟩ ). (12.159) The measure can be easily checked to be invariant under such a fermionic transformation and we note that the above relation can also be written as (see Eq. (12.157)) ∫ d4x (J μa(x) δW δKμa(x) − iηa(x) δW δKa(x) + iηa(x) δW δJ a(x) ) =0 . (12.160) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 314 304 12 Gauge theories This is the Master equation from which one can derive all the iden- tities relating the connected Green’s functions of the theory. It is here that the usefulness of the sources for the composite operators becomes evident. Most often, however, we are interested in the proper (1PI) ver- tices of the theory. These can be obtained by passing from the gen- erating functional for the connected Green’s functions, W [J], to the generating functional for the proper vertices, Γ[A], through a Leg- endre transformation. Deﬁning a Legendre transformation involving (only) the ﬁeld variables of the theory (the ﬁeld variables are re- ally the classical ﬁelds and we are dropping the superscript (c) for simplicity), we have Γ[A, K]= W [J, K] − ∫ d4x (J μaAa μ + J aF a + i (ηaca − caηa)) , (12.161) where K stands generically for the sources for the composite varia- tions. From the deﬁnition of the generating functional for the proper vertices, it is clear that δΓ δAa μ = −J μa , δΓ δF a = −J a, δΓ δca = iηa , δΓ δca = iηa , δΓ δKa μ = δW δKa μ , δΓ δKa = δW δKa . (12.162) Using these deﬁnitions, we see that we can rewrite the Master equa- tion in terms of the generating functional of the proper vertices as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 315 12.6 References 305 ∫ d4x ( δΓ δAa μ(x) δΓ δKμa(x) + δΓ δca(x) δΓ δKa(x) − F a(x) δΓ δca(x) ) =0 . (12.163) This is the Master equation from which we can derive all the relations, between various (1PI) proper vertices, resulting from the BRST invariance of the theory. This, in turn, is essential in proving the renormalizability of gauge theories. Thus, for example, let us note that we can write the Master identity in the momentum space as ∫ d4k ( δΓ δAa μ(−k) δΓ δKμa(k) + δΓ δca(−k) δΓ δKa(k) −F a(k) δΓ δca(k) ) =0 . (12.164) Taking derivative of this with respect to δ2 δF b(p)δcc(−p) and setting all ﬁeld variables to zero gives δ2Γ δF b(p)δAa μ(−p) δ2Γ δcc(−p)δKμa(p) − δ2Γ δcc(−p)δcb(p) =0 . (12.165) A simple analysis, then, shows that this relates the mixed two point function involving F -Aμ with the two point function for the ghost ﬁelds and, consequently, the counter terms (quantum corrections) should satisfy such a relation. The BRST invariance, in this way, is very fundamental in the study of gauge theories as far as renormal- izability and gauge independence are concerned. 12.6 References C. Becchi, A. Rouet and R.

January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 317 Chapter 13 Anomalies We have seen earlier that a continuous global symmetry in a quan- tum ﬁeld theory leads to a current which is conserved and the Ward identities of the theory reﬂect this conservation law. Sometimes, however, the classical (tree level) conservation of the current is vi- olated by quantum corrections (loop eﬀects). This can happen, for example, if the regularization, used to deﬁne divergent amplitudes in a quantum ﬁeld theory, does not respect the symmetry that leads to the conservation law. In this case, the divergence of the current density no longer vanishes and one says that there is an anomaly in the conservation law (or that the current is anomalous). In turn, this modiﬁes the tree level Ward identities of the theory to new ones that are known as anomalous Ward identities of the theory (which reﬂect the modiﬁed conservation law). Anomalies are quite important from a physical point of view. Global anomalies such as the chiral anomaly have direct physical consequences. On the other hand, an anomaly in a gauge theory (namely, in the conservation of the gauge current) can render the theory inconsistent and, therefore, needs to be taken care of before one can make sense of such a theory. In this chapter, we will study some issues associated with this phenomenon. 13.1 Anomalous Ward identity Let us consider a non-Abelian gauge theory interacting with mass- less fermions in 1 + 3 dimensions. If we choose the gauge group to be SU (3), then the fermions can be thought of as the quarks and the theory would describe quantum chromodynamics. For a general gauge group of SU (n), the theory is described by the Lagrangian density 307 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 318 308 13 Anomalies L = − 1 4 F a μνF μνa + i ¯ψiγμ(Dμψ)i, (13.1) where a =1, 2, ··· ,n2 − 1,i =1, 2, ··· ,n,and μ =0, 1, 2, 3. The (gauge) covariant derivative for the fermions is deﬁned as (Dμψ)i = ∂μψi + iA a μ (T a)ij ψj . (13.2) Here (T a)ij denote the generators of the gauge group (SU (n)) in the (fundamental) representation of the fermions and the gauge coupling has been absorbed into the gauge ﬁeld. (Equivalently, we can say that the gauge coupling has been set to unity for simplicity.) Note that this theory in addition to having the inﬁnitesimal non-Abelian local gauge invariance δA a μ(x)=(Dμϵ(x))a , δψi(x)= −iϵa(x)(T aψ(x))i , δ ¯ψi(x)= iϵa(x) ( ¯ψ(x)T a)i , (13.3) where ϵa(x) is the real inﬁnitesimal parameter of the gauge transfor- mation, is also invariant under the inﬁnitesimal global chiral trans- formations δψi(x)= −iλγ5ψi(x), δ ¯ψi(x)= −iλ ¯ψi(x)γ5 . (13.4) Here λ is an inﬁnitesimal space-time independent real parameter and γ5 denotes the pseudoscalar Dirac matrix (deﬁned to be Hermitian). This global symmetry, which corresponds to an Abelian group of transformations (U (1)), is commonly known as the Abelian chiral symmetry of the theory. The invariances of the theory, of course, lead to conserved currents. Thus, for example, for the Abelian chiral symmetry, we have the conservation law ∂μJ μ 5 =0 , (13.5) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 319 13.1 Anomalous Ward identity 309 where the chiral (axial) current density is given by J μ 5 (x)= ¯ψi(x)γ5γμψi(x) . (13.6) The chiral (axial) Ward identities are nothing but manifestations of the fact that the chiral current is conserved. We note here that, if the quarks are massive, i.e., if there is a mass term for the fermions in the Lagrangian density of the form Lm = −m ¯ψψ = −m ¯ψiψi , (13.7) then, the global chiral transformations in Eq. (13.4) will no longer be a symmetry of the theory and as a result, the chiral current in (13.6) would not be conserved. Rather, it will satisfy the relation ∂μJ μ 5 = −2im ¯ψγ5ψ. (13.8) For massive fermions, relation (13.8) would also lead to various re- lations between matrix elements known as the chiral (axial) Ward identities for the broken symmetry. However, when we calculate var- ious matrix elements in a gauge theory (in either broken or unbroken case) regularized in a gauge invariant way, we ﬁnd that the chiral Ward identities (Eq. (13.5) or Eq. (13.8)) are violated at the loop level. More speciﬁcally, the modiﬁcations to the tree level identities arise only at the one loop level. There are various ways of understanding this violation. Let us begin with an analysis in the path integral formalism where we can write the generating functional as (ℏ =1) Z = ∫ DAμD ¯ψDψeiS , (13.9) and here we are keeping the mass term in the action just for generality so that S = ∫ d4x (− 1 4 F a μνF μνa + i ¯ψiγμ(Dμψ)i − m ¯ψiψi) . (13.10) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 320 310 13 Anomalies Let us now make an inﬁnitesimal local chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition of the form (see Eq. (13.4)) δψi(x)= −iλ(x)γ5ψi(x), δ ¯ψi(x)= −iλ(x) ¯ψi(x)γ5 . (13.11) The generating functional should be invariant under such a ﬁeld re- deﬁnition since we are integrating over all ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Fur- thermore, for this analysis (namely, for evaluating the fermion path integral), we can treat the Aμ ﬁeld as an external ﬁeld and look at only the fermion part of the action. Namely, let us consider the fermion part of the path integral Zf [A]= ∫ D ¯ψDψeiSf = ∫ D ¯ψDψei ∫ d4x(i ¯ψiγμ(Dμψ)i−m ¯ψiψi) , (13.12) so that under the redeﬁnition in Eq. (13.11) δZf [A]= ∫ D ¯ψDψ [∫ d4x(−i(∂μλ) ¯ψiγ5γμψ − 2λm ¯ψiγ5ψi) ] eiSf = ∫ D ¯ψDψ [i∫ d4xλ (∂μ( ¯ψiγ5γμψi)+2im ¯ψiγ5ψi) ] eiSf =0. (13.13) Here we have assumed that the path integral measure does not change under the inﬁnitesimal ﬁeld redeﬁnition in Eq. (13.11). Equa- tion (13.13) implies that 〈∫ d4x(∂μ( ¯ψi(x)γ5γμψi(x)) + 2im ¯ψi(x)γ5ψi(x))λ(x) 〉 =0, or, ⟨∂μJ μ 5 (x)+2im ¯ψi(x)γ5ψi(x)⟩ =0 , (13.14) since this has to hold for any arbitrary (inﬁnitesimal) λ(x)atall co- ordinates. This is the naive (tree level) Ward identity (see Eq. (13.8)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 321 13.1 Anomalous Ward identity 311 associated with broken chiral symmetry and the natural question that arises is why does this fail at the one loop level. To understand this, let us note that in this derivation our only assumption has been that the path integral measure is insensitive to the chiral redeﬁnition of the ﬁelds. Therefore, we should reanalyze the behavior of the functional measure under such a ﬁeld redeﬁnition more carefully to see if that may be the source of violation of the naive Ward identity. To understand the question of the measure, let us assume that we can solve for the eigenstates of the gauge covariant Dirac operator, iD/φn(x)= iγμDμφn(x)= λnφn(x) . (13.15) Here φn(x)’s represent the eigenstates of the Dirac operator and λn’s are the corresponding eigenvalues. We have assumed that these are discrete states just for simplicity. Furthermore, since these sates de- ﬁne an orthonormal complete basis (the Dirac operator is a Hermitian operator), we have ∫ d4xφ† n(x)φm(x)= δnm , ∑ n φn(x)φ† n(y)= δ4(x − y) . (13.16) We can expand the fermion ﬁelds in the basis of these eigenfunctions as ψ(x)= ∑ n anφn(x) , ¯ψ(x)= ∑ n φ† n(x)bn , (13.17) where we are suppressing the index i for simplicity. For example, Eq. (13.17) can be thought of as a transformation from the wave function basis to the occupation number basis or any other discrete quantum number basis. In terms of bra and ket notations we can write January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 322 312 13 Anomalies ψ(x)= ⟨x|ψ⟩ = ∑ n ⟨x|n⟩⟨n|ψ⟩ = ∑ n φn(x)an = ∑ n anφn(x) , (13.18) and so on. In this basis, the integration measure can be written as D ¯ψ(x)Dψ(x)= ∏ n dbndan. (13.19) Let us now make an inﬁnitesimal chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition (see Eq. (13.11)) ψ(x) → ψ ′(x)= ψ(x) − iλ(x)γ5ψ(x) , ¯ψ(x) → ¯ψ ′(x)= ¯ψ(x) − iλ(x) ¯ψ(x)γ5 . (13.20) We can also expand the new variables ψ ′(x), ¯ψ ′(x) in the same eigen- basis. For example, we can write ψ ′(x)= ∑ n a′ nφn(x)= ∑ n,m cnmamφn(x) , (13.21) where the matrix cnm is given by cnm = δnm − i ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x) . (13.22) This can be seen easily in the following way ψ ′(x)= ⟨x|ψ′⟩ = ∑ n ⟨x|n⟩⟨n|ψ′⟩ = ∑ n a′ nφn(x)= ∑ n ⟨x|n⟩⟨n|c|ψ⟩ , (13.23) where c denotes the inﬁnitesimal chiral transformation matrix. Thus January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 323 13.1 Anomalous Ward identity 313 ψ′(x)= ∑ n a′ nφn(x)= ∑ n ⟨x|n⟩⟨n|c|ψ⟩ = ∑ n,m⟨x|n⟩⟨n|c|m⟩⟨m|ψ⟩ = ∑ n,m cnmamφn(x) , (13.24) where cnm = ⟨n|c|m⟩ = ∫ d4xd4x′⟨n|x⟩⟨x|c|x′⟩⟨x′|m⟩ = ∫ d4xd4x′ φ† n(x)c(x, x′)φm(x′) . (13.25) We note that the chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition in Eq. (13.11) is a local transformation so that c(x, x′) is a local function, i.e., ψ′(x)= c(x)ψ(x)=(\u0000 − iλ(x)γ5) ψ(x) . (13.26) If we use this fact in Eq. (13.25), then we obtain cnm = ∫ d4xd4x′φ† n(x)c(x)δ(x − x′)φm(x′) = ∫ d4xφ† n(x)c(x)φm(x) = ∫ d4xφ† n(x)(\u0000 − iλ(x)γ5) φm(x) = δnm − i ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x) . (13.27) The above analysis shows that under the chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition in Eq. (13.11) ∏ n dan → ∏ n da′ n =(det cnm)−1 ∏ n dan , (13.28) and we recognize that the inverse of the determinant (rather than the determinant) appears in this case simply because an’s are fermionic January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 324 314 13 Anomalies in character (see Chapter 5). Similarly, under the ﬁeld redeﬁnition in Eq. (13.11) ∏ n dbn → ∏ n db′ n =(det cnm)−1 ∏ n dbn. (13.29) Therefore, it is clear that under the chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition the fermion integration measure changes and contributes a nontrivial amount (unless the determinant is unity) given by D ¯ψDψ → (det cnm)−2 D ¯ψDψ, (13.30) where det cnm =det (δnm − i ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x)) =exp (Tr ln (δnm − i ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x))) =exp (Tr (−i ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x))) =exp ( −i ∑ n ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) ) , (13.31) wherewehaveused thefactthat λ(x) is an inﬁnitesimal parameter. Since n takes inﬁnitely many values, the sum in the exponent is ill deﬁned. Therefore, we regularize the expression in the exponent as ∑ n ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) = lim M 2→∞ ∑ n ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x)e−( λn M )2 = lim M 2→∞ ∑ n ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5e−( iD/ M )2φn(x) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 325 13.1 Anomalous Ward identity 315 = lim M 2→∞ ∑ n ∫ d4x d4k (2π)4 d4k′ (2π)4 λ(x) ˜φ† n(k′)eik′·x × γ5e−( iD/ M )2e−ik·x ˜φn(k) . (13.32) If we use the completeness relation for the basis functions in momen- tum space, namely, ∑ n ˜φn(k) ˜φ† n(k′)=(2π)4δ4(k − k′) , (13.33) then, Eq. (13.32) takes the form ∑ n ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) = lim M 2→∞ ∫ d4x d4k (2π)4 d4k′ (2π)4 (2π)4δ4(k − k′) × Tr λ(x) eik′·xγ5e−( iD/ M )2e−ik·x = lim M 2→∞ ∫ d4x d4k (2π)4 λ(x)Tr eik·xγ5e−( iD/ M )2e−ik·x . (13.34) To simplify this expression, we note that using the properties of the Dirac matrices, we can write (iD/ )2 = −γμγνDμDν = − ( 1 2 [γμ,γν]+ + 1 2 [γμ,γν]) DμDν = (−ημν − 1 2 [γμ,γν]) DμDν = −DμDμ − γμγν 1 2 [Dμ,Dν] = −DμDμ − i 2 γμγνFμν , (13.35) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 326 316 13 Anomalies where we are using the matrix representation for the gauge ﬁelds, namely, Aμ = Aa μT a,Fμν = F a μνT a with the generators T a in the representation of the fermions. It is clear, therefore, that the regu- larized exponent in (13.34) can be written as ∑ n ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) = lim M 2→∞ ∫ d4x d4k (2π)4 λ(x)Tr eik·xγ5e− 1 M 2 (−DμDμ− i 2 γμγν Fμν)e−ik·x = lim M 2→∞ ∫ d4x d4k (2π)4 λ(x)Tr γ5 1 2!

(13.36) We note here that in the intermediate steps we have used the fact that the “Trace” is deﬁned over the Dirac indices as well as the gauge indices and that in our discussions we have set the coupling constant for the gauge theory to unity. (We point out that the factor of i in evaluating the Gaussian integral arises from rotating to Euclidean space in order to do the integral carefully.) Therefore, we have deter- mined that (with a gauge invariant regularization) the determinant is nontrivial and is given by January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 327 13.1 Anomalous Ward identity 317 det cnm =exp [ −i ∑ n ∫ d4xλ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) ] =exp [− i 32π2 ∫ d4xλ(x)ϵμνλρ Tr (Fμν(x)Fλρ(x))] . (13.37) In other words, we have determined that the functional integra- tion measure changes nontrivially under the chiral redeﬁnition of the ﬁelds and the change in the fermionic measure under an inﬁnitesimal chiral transformation is given by (see also Eq. (13.30)) δ (D ¯ψDψ) = D ¯ψ′Dψ′ −D ¯ψDψ = ((det cnm)−2 − 1) D ¯ψDψ = D ¯ψDψ [ i 16π2 ∫ d4xλ(x)ϵμνλρ Tr (Fμν(x)Fλρ(x))] . (13.38) As a result, we note that the change of the generating functional under an inﬁnitesimal chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition (see also Eq. (13.14)) is correctly given by δZf [A]=0= ∫ D ¯ψDψ[i ∫ d4xλ(x){ 1 16π2 ϵμνλρ Tr (FμνFλρ) + ∂μJ μ 5 +2im ¯ψγ5ψ}]eiS , (13.39) which leads to the relation ⟨∂μJ μ 5 (x)+2im ¯ψγ5ψ⟩ + 1 16π2 ϵμνλρ Tr (Fμν(x)Fλρ(x)) = 0 . (13.40) This corresponds to the operator identity ∂μJ μ 5 (x)= −2im ¯ψγ5ψ − 1 16π2 ϵμνλρ Tr (Fμν(x)Fλρ(x)) = −2im ¯ψγ5ψ − 1 16π2 Tr (Fμν(x) ˜F μν(x)) , (13.41) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 328 318 13 Anomalies where the dual ﬁeld strength tensor is deﬁned as ˜Fμν(x)= ϵμνλρF λρ(x) , (13.42) and the last term in Eq. (13.41) on the right hand side is known as the anomaly associated with the chiral (axial) current conservation (in four space-time dimensions). Let us note here that sometimes in literature the right hand side of Eq. (13.41) may appear with the opposite sign and that is because in those works the chiral current is deﬁned with an opposite sign. It is also worth pointing out here that this derivation clariﬁes two things. First, the regularization we used to deﬁne the inﬁnite sum is gauge invariant (since the Dirac operator is gauge invariant) which does not respect chiral symmetry. The second point to note is that a determinant is normally associated with a one loop eﬀect which clariﬁes why the anomaly is a one loop eﬀect. Anomalies have observable eﬀects. For example, the correct pion life time can be obtained in a ﬁeld theoretic calculation only if the chiral anomaly is taken into account. Furthermore, if we have a theory where there are both vectorial and axial vectorial couplings of the fermions to gauge ﬁelds (corresponding to local symmetries), the model cannot be renormalized unless the anomaly is cancelled. In grand uniﬁed theories where we treat both quarks and leptons as massless, they have precisely these kinds of couplings. Therefore, one cannot make a consistent grand uniﬁed theory unless one can cancel out the chiral anomaly (associated with the local chiral in- variances) and this leads to the study of groups and representations which are anomaly free. In string theories, that are currently fashion- able, similar anomaly free considerations (associated with gauge and gravitational anomalies) ﬁx the gauge group uniquely to be SO(32) or E(8) × E(8). 13.2 Schwinger model The Schwinger model describes massless quantum electrodynamics (QED) in 1 + 1 dimension. This is a model that can be exactly solved and the structure of the resulting eﬀective gauge theory is directly related to the anomaly in the theory. Let us see how this January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 329 13.2 Schwinger model 319 arises. The Lagrangian density describing the interaction of massless charged fermions with an Abelian gauge ﬁeld is given by L = − 1 4 FμνF μν + i ¯ψγμ (∂μ + ieAμ) ψ, μ =0, 1, (13.43) where e denotes the electric charge of the fermion. This theory is invariant under local U (1) transformations as well as global chiral U (1) transformations (since fermions are massless). We would ex- amine the model in two diﬀerent approaches. But ﬁrst let us note some of the special features of two dimensional space time. Note that in two dimensions there cannot be any transverse polarization and consequently the photon does not have any true (transverse) degrees of freedom. There is only an electric ﬁeld associ- ated with the photon since the only nontrivial component of the ﬁeld strength tensor is F01. Furthermore, the electromagnetic coupling in two dimensional QED is dimensional unlike in four dimensional QED where it is a dimensionless constant. This can be seen as follows. In natural units (ℏ = c = 1), the action is dimensionless [S]= [∫ d2x L] =0 , (13.44) which implies that the Lagrangian density has the canonical dimen- sion [L]=2 . (13.45) From the free part of L we determine the canonical dimension of the ﬁelds to be [Aμ]=0 , [ψ]=[ ¯ψ]= 1 2 . (13.46) With these, the interaction Lagrangian density leads to [e]=1 . (13.47) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 330 320 13 Anomalies Furthermore, by power counting (as well as gauge invariance) it is easily seen that this theory has only a mild divergence (at loop or- ders) so that this is a fairly well behaved theory. Note also that in two dimensions if we choose our Dirac matrices to satisfy (γ0)† = γ0, (γ0)2 = \u0000 , (13.48) (γ1)† = −γ1, (γ1)2 = −\u0000 , (13.49) and γ5 = γ0γ1, (13.50) so that γ† 5 = γ1†γ0† = −γ1γ0 = γ0γ1 = γ5 , γ2 5 = γ0γ1γ0γ1 = − (γ0)2 (γ1)2 = \u0000 , (13.51) then a possible representation for these matrices is given by γ0 = ( 01 10 ) = σ1, γ1 = ( 0 −1 10 ) = −iσ2, γ5 = ( 10 0 −1 ) = σ3, (13.52) where σi,i =1, 2, 3 denote the three Pauli matrices. Furthermore, note that in addition to the symmetric second rank metric tensor which is diagonal and has the form ημν =(+, −)= ηνμ , (13.53) in two dimensions, we also have a second rank anti-symmetric tensor given by January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 331 13.2 Schwinger model 321 ϵμν = −ϵνμ . (13.54) This is the Levi-Civita tensor in two dimensions which is completely anti-symmetric and is chosen as ϵ01 =1= −ϵ10 . (13.55) Similarly, for the covariant Levi-Civita tensor, we have ϵ01 = −1= −ϵ10 . (13.56) Using the Levi-Civita tensor, we can write γ5 = − 1 2 ϵμνγμγν = − 1 2 ϵμνγμγν = − 1 4 ϵμν [γμ,γν]= − 1 2 ϵμνσμν , (13.57) where we have deﬁned (in analogy with four dimensions) σμν = 1 2 [γμ,γν] . (13.58) This leads to ϵλργ5 = − 1 2 ϵλρϵμνσμν = − 1 2 (−ηλμηρν + ηλνηρμ) σμν, or,ϵλργ5 = σλρ, or,σμν = ϵμνγ5 . (13.59) It is clear now that we can write γμγν = 1 2 {γμ,γν}+ 1 2 [γμ,γν]= ημν +σμν = ημν +ϵμνγ5 . (13.60) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 332 322 13 Anomalies Furthermore, using Eqs. (13.58) and (13.60) we have (γνγμγν =0 in two dimensions) σμνγν = ϵμνγ5γν, or,γμ = ϵμνγ5γν . (13.61) Conversely, we can write γ5γμ = ϵμνγν . (13.62) As a result of these identities, we note that in two dimensions, the vector and the axial vector current densities deﬁned as J μ = e ¯ψγμψ, J μ 5 = e ¯ψγ5γμψ, (13.63) are related by the duality relations J μ = ϵμνJ5ν, J μ 5 = ϵμνJν . (13.64) The propagator for the (massless) free fermion (Aμ =0) can be related to the free propagator for the massless scalar ﬁeld as iS(0) F (x − x′)= i∂/(iG(0) F (x − x′)) , (13.65) where iS(0) F (x − x′)= ⟨T (ψ(x) ¯ψ(x′))⟩, iG(0) F (x − x′)= ⟨T (φ(x)φ(x′))⟩ , (13.66) and the free scalar propagator satisﬁes the equation □(iG(0) F (x − x′)) = −iδ2(x − x′) . (13.67) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 333 13.2 Schwinger model 323 To determine the free Green’s functions let us note that the time ordered scalar Green’s function can be written in terms of positive and negative frequency functions as iG(0) F (x)= θ(x0)(−iG(+)(x0,x)) + θ(−x0)(iG(−)(x0,x)), (13.68) where ∓iG(±)(x0,x)= 1 2(2π) ∞∫ −∞ dk |k| e∓i|k|x0+ikx = 1 2(2π) ∞∫ 0 dk k e∓ikx0 (eikx + e−ikx) = 1 2π ∞∫ 0 dk k e∓ikx0 cos kx . (13.69) Therefore, from Eqs. (13.68) and (13.69) we have iG(0) F (x0,x)= 1 2π ∞∫ 0 dk k e−ikx0 cos kx, x0 ≥ 0, (13.70) and, for x0 ≥ 0, we have from Eq. (13.65) iS(0) F (x0,x)= iγμ∂μ ⎛ ⎝ 1 2π ∞∫ 0 dk k e−ikx0 cos kx ⎞ ⎠ = i 2π ∞∫ 0 dk k (−iγ0k cos kx − γ1k sin kx) e−ikx0 = − iγ1 2π ∞∫ 0 dk (−iγ1γ0 cos kx +sin kx) e−ikx0 = − iγ1 2π ∞∫ 0 dk (iγ5 cos kx +sin kx) e−ikx0 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 334 324 13 Anomalies = γ1γ5 2π ∞∫ 0 dk (cos kx − iγ5 sin kx) e−ikx0 = γ1γ5 2π ∞∫ 0 dke−ikx0−iγ5kx . (13.71) For x0 = 0, this leads to iS(0) F (0,x) ≡ iS(0) F (x)= γ1γ5 2π ∞∫ 0 dke−iγ5kx = γ1γ5 2π 1 iγ5x = γ1 2πix . (13.72) Let us now calculate the fermion propagator in the presence of an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. Denoting by iS (A) F (x, x′)= ⟨T (ψ(x) ¯ψ(x′))⟩A , (13.73) we note that this satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation iγμ (∂μ + ieAμ) S (A) F (x, x′)= δ2(x − x′). (13.74) To solve for the complete fermion Green’s function (propagator) we note that the most general solution of Eq. (13.73) can be written as S (A) F (x − x′)= e−i(φ(x)−φ(x′))S(0) F (x − x′) , (13.75) where S(0) F (x − x′) is the free Green’s function (already determined in Eq. (13.72) for equal times) satisfying i∂/S(0) F (x − x′)= δ2(x − x′) , (13.76) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 335 13.2 Schwinger model 325 and φ(x)isa2 × 2 matrix function (in the Dirac space and not the scalar ﬁeld) satisfying iγμ (−∂μ(iφ(x)) + ieAμ)=0, or,γμ∂μφ(x) − eγμAμ =0, or,∂/φ(x)= eγμAμ, or, □φ(x)= eγμγν∂μAν = e (ημν + ϵμνγ5) ∂μAν = e∂μAμ + e 2 γ5ϵμνFμν , (13.77) so that □ (Tr φ(x)) = 2e∂μAμ , (13.78) and □ (Tr γ5φ(x)) = eϵμνFμν . (13.79) Let us note here that the whole point of this exercise is to show that in two dimensions one can always ﬁnd a matrix function φ(x) such that (see Eq. (13.77)) γμAμ = γμ∂μφ(x) . (13.80) That this is true can also be seen from the fact that in two dimensions we can always decompose a vector as Aμ = ∂μσ + ϵμν∂νη, (13.81) so that γμAμ = γμ∂μσ + γμϵμν∂νη = γμ∂μσ + γμγ5∂μη = γμ∂μ (σ + γ5η)= γμ∂μφ, (13.82) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 336 326 13 Anomalies with φ(x)= σ(x)+ γ5η(x) , (13.83) where we have used Eq.

(13.85) This leads explicitly to (since fermions anti-commute) ⟨J μ(x)⟩A = lim x→x′,x0=x′ 0 −eTr γμ⟨ψ(x) ¯ψ(x′)⟩Aeie x∫ x′ dxλAλ = lim x→x′,x0=x′ 0 −eTr γμiS (A) F (x, x′)eie x∫ x′ dxλAλ = lim x→x′,x0=x′ 0 −eTr(γμ [1 − i(x − x′) ∂ ∂x φ(x)] γ1 2πi(x − x′) × [1+ ie(x − x′)A1(x)] ) = lim x→x′ −Tr [ eγμγ1 2πi(x − x′) − e 2π γμ∂1φγ1 + e2 2π γμγ1A1 ]. (13.86) Neglecting the uninteresting inﬁnite constant (coming from the ﬁrst term), we determine ⟨J μ(x)⟩A = e 2π Tr γμ (∂1φγ1 − eγ1A1) . (13.87) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 337 13.2 Schwinger model 327 Furthermore, we note from Eq. (13.83) that we can write φ(x)= 1 2 Tr (φ(x)) + 1 2 γ5 Tr (γ5φ(x)) , (13.88) so that Eq. (13.87) becomes ⟨J μ(x)⟩A = e 2π Tr[( 1 2 γμγ1∂1Tr φ(x) − 1 2 γμγ1γ5∂1Tr γ5φ(x)) − eγμγ1A1 ] = e 2π [ημ1(∂1 (Tr φ(x)) − 2A1) − ϵμ1∂1 Tr (γ5φ(x))] . (13.89) On the other hand, since ∂/φ(x)= eA/, or,∂/ [ 1 2 Tr φ(x)+ 1 2 γ5 Tr γ5φ(x)] = eA/, (13.90) we obtain Tr γ0∂/ [ 1 2 Tr φ(x)+ 1 2 γ5 Tr γ5φ(x)] =Tr eγ0A/, or,∂0 Tr φ(x)+ ∂1 Tr (γ5φ(x)) = 2eA0, (13.91) and Tr γ1∂/ [ 1 2 Tr φ(x)+ 1 2 γ5 Tr γ5φ(x)] =Tr eγ1A/, or,∂1 Tr φ(x) − ∂0 Tr (γ5φ(x)) = 2eA1 . (13.92) Using these relations as well as the deﬁnition in (13.89) we can write January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 338 328 13 Anomalies ⟨J 0(x)⟩A = − e 2π ∂1 Tr γ5φ(x) = e 2π (∂0 Tr φ(x) − 2eA0) , (13.93) and ⟨J 1(x)⟩A = − e 2π (∂1 Tr φ(x) − 2eA1) = e 2π (∂1 Tr φ(x) − 2eA1) . (13.94) We can write the relations in Eqs. (13.93) and (13.94) in a covariant manner as ⟨J μ(x)⟩A = e 2π (∂μ Tr φ(x) − 2eAμ) . (13.95) Using the solution Eq. (13.78), namely, Tr φ(x)=2e □−1∂μA μ , (13.96) in Eq. (13.95) we obtain ⟨J μ(x)⟩A = e 2π (2e∂μ□−1∂νAν − 2eA μ) = − e2 π (ημν − ∂μ□−1∂ν) Aν . (13.97) This is a gauge invariant current which is conserved as is readily seen from its transverse structure. However, it is also clear from this relation that ∂μ⟨J μ 5 (x)⟩A = ∂μϵμν⟨Jν(x)⟩A = − e2 2π ϵμνFμν ̸=0 . (13.98) Namely, the chiral current is no longer conserved. Let us next study the generating functional for the Schwinger model which has the form (see Eq. (13.9)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 339 13.2 Schwinger model 329 Z = ∫ DAμD ¯ψDψeiS, (13.99) where (see Eq. (13.43)) S = ∫ d2x (− 1 4 FμνF μν + i ¯ψγμ(∂μ + ieAμ)ψ) . (13.100) The integration over the fermion ﬁelds can be easily done (the action is quadratic in the variables) and the result is Z = ∫ DAμ det (i∂/ − eA/) ei ∫ d2x(− 1 4 Fμν F μν) = ∫ DAμ eTr ln(i∂/−eA/)ei ∫ d2x(− 1 4 Fμν F μν) = ∫ DAμ eiSeﬀ , (13.101) where Seﬀ = ∫ d2x (− 1 4 FμνF μν) − iTr ln (i∂/ − eA/)(x), (13.102) and “Tr” denotes trace over the Dirac indices as well as over the coordinate basis. To understand the meaning of this eﬀective action better, let us look at the Euler-Lagrange equation following from this (here “Tr” denotes trace over only the Dirac indices) ∂μ ∂Seﬀ ∂∂μAν(x) − ∂Seﬀ ∂Aν(x) =0, or, − ∂μF μν(x) − i (Tr (i∂/ − eA/)−1 (x, x)eγν) =0, or,∂μF μν(x)+ e Tr iS (A) F (x, x)γν =0, or,∂μF μν(x) −⟨J ν(x)⟩A =0, or,∂μF μν(x)+ e2 π (ηνλ − ∂ν□−1∂λ) Aλ(x)=0 . (13.103) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 340 330 13 Anomalies Here we have used Eq. (13.97) in the last step. The eﬀective theory now describes a massive photon with the mass of the photon given by m 2 ph = e2 π . (13.104) This can be better seen by choosing a covariant gauge such as the Landau gauge ∂μAμ(x)=0 , (13.105) in which case the Euler-Lagrange equation (13.103) becomes ∂μF μν(x)+ m2 phAν(x)=0, or, □Aν(x)+ m2 phAν(x)=0, or, (□ + m2 ph) A ν(x)=0 , (13.106) which is the equation for a massive gauge ﬁeld. In this case the eﬀective action in Eq. (13.102) for the photon ﬁeld can be written as (not using the Landau gauge) Seﬀ = ∫ d2x ( − 1 4 FμνF μν + m2 ph 2 Aμ (ημν − ∂μ□−1∂ν) Aν ) , (13.107) which again shows that the photon in the eﬀective theory has become massive. Another way of seeing the same result is to look at the gener- ating functional for the fermions Zf [A]= ∫ D ¯ψDψeiS[ψ, ¯ψ,A] , (13.108) where January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 341 13.2 Schwinger model 331 S[ψ, ¯ψ, A]= ∫ d2xi ¯ψ (∂/ + ieA/) ψ. (13.109) It follows now that δZf [A] δAμ(x) = −i ∫ D ¯ψDψ (e ¯ψ(x)γμψ(x)) eiS = −i ∫ D ¯ψDψJ μ(x) eiS = −i⟨J μ(x)⟩AZ[A] = ie2 π (ημν − ∂μ□−1∂ν) Aν Z[A] , (13.110) where we have used the identiﬁcation in Eq. (13.97). Integrating this, we obtain Zf [A]= e ie2 2π ∫ d2xAμ(ημν −∂μ□−1∂ν)Aν = e im2 ph 2 ∫ d2xAμ(ημν −∂μ□−1∂ν)Aν . (13.111) Therefore, we can write the complete generating functional as Z = ∫ DAμD ¯ψDψei ∫ d2x(− 1 4 Fμν F μν)+ iS[ψ, ¯ψ,A] = ∫ DAμ ei ∫ d2x ( − 1 4 Fμν F μν + m2 ph 2 Aμ(ημν −∂μ□−1∂ν)Aν ) = ∫ DAμ eiSeﬀ . (13.112) The phenomenon of the gauge ﬁeld becoming massive through spon- taneous breaking of a local symmetry is quite well understood through the Higgs mechanism (which involves a fundamental scalar ﬁeld to break the symmetry). However, the novel feature here is that there is no fundamental scalar ﬁeld in this theory. In this sense, it is called a dynamical symmetry breaking and the symmetry that is broken in this case is the chiral symmetry. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 342 332 13 Anomalies Note that the nonlocal eﬀective Lagrangian density in Eq. (13.112) (or in Eq. (13.107)) Leﬀ = − 1 4 FμνF μν + m2 ph 2 Aμ (ημν − ∂μ□−1∂ν) Aν , (13.113) can be written in a local manner by introducing a scalar ﬁeld B(x) as Leﬀ = − 1 4 FμνF μν + 1 2 ∂μB(x)∂μB(x) − mphϵμνAμ∂νB(x) . (13.114) Integrating out the scalar ﬁeld B(x) (on which the action depends quadratically) we obtain the earlier form of the eﬀective action. On the other hand, once we have this local form of the eﬀective action, we can integrate out the Aμ ﬁeld completely since the Lagrangian density depends on the gauge ﬁeld at most quadratically. The re- sulting Lagrangian density in this case is given by Leﬀ = 1 2 ∂μB(x)∂μB(x) − m2 ph 2 B(x)B(x) . (13.115) Namely, the complete Schwinger model including all quantum cor- rections is equivalent to a free, massive scalar ﬁeld. This is often referred to as the bosonization of the model. The fermions have completely disappeared from the theory. Let us now analyze the Schwinger model from a diﬀerent point of view. The generating functional, as we have seen, is given by (the generating functional should be rigorously evaluated in the Euclidean space, but we will discuss it in the Minkowski space pointing out where care should be taken) Z = ∫ DAμD ¯ψDψeiS, (13.116) where the action has the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 343 13.2 Schwinger model 333 S = ∫ d2x [− 1 4 FμνF μν + i ¯ψγμ (∂μ + ieAμ) ψ] . (13.117) Since the theory has a local gauge invariance let us choose a covariant gauge condition such as the Landau gauge condition ∂μAμ(x)=0 . (13.118) Let us recall (see Eq. (13.81)) that in two dimensions we can write Aμ(x)= ∂μσ(x)+ ϵμν∂νη(x) . (13.119) Therefore, the Landau gauge condition implies ∂μAμ(x)=0 or, σ(x)=0 . (13.120) In other words, in this gauge we can write Aμ(x)= ϵμν∂νη(x)and the fermion Lagrangian density takes the form L = i ¯ψγμ (∂μ + ieAμ) ψ = i ¯ψγμ (∂μ + ieϵμν(∂νη)) ψ = i ¯ψγμ (∂μ + ieγ5(∂μη)) ψ, (13.121) where we have used Eq. (13.62). Letusnextnotethatifwemakealocalchiralﬁeldredeﬁnition of the form ψ(x) → ψ ′(x)= e−ieγ5α(x)ψ(x) , ¯ψ(x) → ¯ψ ′(x)= ¯ψ(x)e−ieγ5α(x) , (13.122) then the fermion Lagrangian density transforms as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 344 334 13 Anomalies L→ i ¯ψ ′(x)γμ (∂μ + ieγ5(∂μη(x))) ψ ′(x) = i ¯ψ(x)e−ieγ5α(x)γμ (∂μ + ieγ5(∂μη)) e−ieγ5α(x)ψ(x) = i ¯ψ(x)γμ (∂μ − ieγ5(∂μ(α(x) − η(x)))) ψ(x) . (13.123) Therefore, if we choose α(x)= η(x), the fermion ﬁeld would decouple and the theory would appear to consist of only free photons and free massless fermions. This is quite diﬀerent from what we have seen in the earlier analysis. The real story lies in the change in the functional measure under such a ﬁeld redeﬁnition. In this two dimensional case the change in the measure for a ﬁ- nite ﬁeld redeﬁnition has to be calculated carefully. To do this, let us note that the ﬁnite ﬁeld redeﬁnition with a ﬁnite parameter α(x)can be obtained by making N successive inﬁnitesimal ﬁeld redeﬁnitions with parameter ϵ(x) such that lim ϵ→0,N →∞ Nϵ(x)= α(x) . (13.124) An inﬁnitesimal chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition can be seen from Eq. (13.122) to be given by ψ(x) → ψ ′(x)= ψ(x) − ieϵ(x)γ5ψ(x) , ¯ψ(x) → ¯ψ ′(x)= ¯ψ(x) − ieϵ(x) ¯ψ(x)γ5 , (13.125) Furthermore, let us assume that we have already made n successive inﬁnitesimal transformations. The fermion Lagrangian density, after the n transformations, has the form (see Eq. (13.123)) L = i ¯ψ(x)γμ (∂μ − ieγ5(∂μ(nϵ(x) − η(x)))) ψ(x). (13.126) Let us deﬁne the eigenvalue equation iD/φk(x)= iγμ (∂μ − ieγ5(∂μ(nϵ(x) − η(x)))) φk(x) = λkφk(x) . (13.127) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 345 13.2 Schwinger model 335 If the φk’s form a complete set, then as discussed in Eq. (13.16), the eigenvectors satisfy ∫ d2xφ† k(x)φm(x)= δkm, ∑ k φk(x)φ† k(y)= δ2(x − y) . (13.128) We canexpandthe fermionﬁeldvariables ψ and ¯ψ in this basis as ψ(x)= ∑ n anφn(x), ¯ψ(x)= ∑ n bnφ† n(x) , (13.129) so that the functional integration measure (in the path integral) can be written as D ¯ψDψ = ∏ n dbndan. (13.130) If we make an inﬁnitesimal ﬁeld redeﬁnition as in Eq. (13.125), then as we have discussed in Eqs. (13.21)–(13.28), we can determine that ψ(x) → ψ′(x)= ∑ n a′ nφn(x)= ∑ n,m cnmamφn(x) , (13.131) where cnm = δnm − ie ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x). (13.132) Therefore, ∏ n dan → ∏ n da′ n =(det cnm)−1 ∏ n dan . (13.133) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 346 336 13 Anomalies Similarly, ∏ n dbn → ∏ n db′ n =(det cnm)−1 ∏ n dbn , (13.134) so that D ¯ψDψ →D ¯ψ ′Dψ ′ =(det cnm)−2 D ¯ψDψ. (13.135) Let us, therefore, calculate the determinant det cnm =det (δnm − ie ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x)) =exp (Tr ln (δnm − ie ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x))) =exp ( −ie ∑ n ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) ) . (13.136) The exponent can be calculated in a regularized manner as before −ie ∑ n ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) = lim M 2→∞ −ie ∑ n ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φn(x) e− λ2 n M 2 = lim M 2→∞ −ie ∑ n ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5 e D/2 M 2 φn(x) = lim M 2→∞ −ie ∑ n ∫ d2x d2k (2π)2 d2k′ (2π)2 ϵ(x) × ˜φ† n(k′)eik′·xγ5e D/2 M 2 e−ik·x ˜φn(k) . (13.137) Using the completeness relation in the momentum space ∑ n ˜φn(k) ˜φ† n(k′)=(2π)2δ2(k − k′) , (13.138) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 347 13.2 Schwinger model 337 the regularized exponent in the above relation takes the form = lim M 2→∞ −ie ∫ d2x d2k (2π)2 ϵ(x)Tr eik·xγ5 e D/2 M 2 e−ik·x. (13.139) Let us note the two dimensional identity D/2 = γμDμγνDν = γμγν (∂μ − ieγ5(∂μ(nϵ − η))) (∂ν − ieγ5(∂ν(nϵ − η))) =(ημν + γ5ϵμν)(∂μ − ieγ5(∂μ(nϵ − η))) (∂ν − ieγ5(∂ν(nϵ − η))) = ∂μ∂μ − e2(∂μ(nϵ − η))(∂μ(nϵ − η)) − 2ieγ5(∂μ(nϵ − η))∂μ − ieγ5(∂μ∂μ(nϵ − η)) − 2ieϵμν(∂μ(nϵ − η))∂ν . (13.140) Using this in Eq. (13.139), we obtain (recall that Tr γ5 =0) −ie ∑ n ∫ d2xϵ(x)φ†(x)γ5φn(x) = lim M 2→∞ −ie ∫ d2x d2k (2π)2 ϵ(x) (− 2ie M 2 ) (∂μ∂μ(nϵ − η)) e− k2 M 2 = lim M 2→∞ − 2e2 M 2 ∫ d2xϵ(x)(∂μ∂μ(nϵ − η)) × (−iπM 2) 4π2 = ie2 2π ∫ d2xϵ(x)(∂μ∂μ(nϵ − η)) . (13.141) Here the factor of (−i) in the evaluation of the Gaussian integral arises from going to Euclidean space as we should have rigorously done. Thus, we see that under this single inﬁnitesimal transformation after n successive transformations, the measure changes as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 348 338 13 Anomalies D ¯ψDψ →D ¯ψ ′Dψ ′ =(det cnm)−2 D ¯ψDψ =exp (− ie2 π ∫ d2xϵ(x)(∂μ∂μ(nϵ(x) − η))) D ¯ψDψ = (1 − ie2 π ∫ d2xϵ(x)(∂μ∂μ(nϵ(x) − η))) D ¯ψDψ. (13.142) As we make N inﬁnitesimal transformations, the measure changes as D ¯ψDψ → N∏ n=0 (1 − ie2 π ∫ d2xϵ(x)(∂μ∂μ(nϵ − η))) D ¯ψDψ. (13.143) Using the result that if X = N∏ n=0 (1+ aϵ + nbϵ2) , (13.144) then, for inﬁnitesimal ϵ and large N such that Nϵ is ﬁnite, we have ln X = N∑ n=0 ln (1+ aϵ + nbϵ2) = N∑ n=0 (aϵ + nbϵ2) =(N +1)aϵ + 1 2 N (N +1)bϵ2 . (13.145) Therefore, in the limit ϵ → 0,N →∞,N ϵ = α, we obtain ln X = aα + b 2 α2, or, X = eaα+ b 2 α2. (13.146) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 349 13.2 Schwinger model 339 This gives the change in the measure for a ﬁnite chiral redeﬁni- tion of ﬁelds to be D ¯ψDψ → exp [− ie2 π ∫ d2xα(x) (∂μ∂μ ( 1 2 α(x) − η))] D ¯ψDψ. (13.147) Furthermore, if we choose α(x)= η(x), then we obtain D ¯ψDψ → exp (− ie2 π ∫ d2xη(x) (∂μ∂μ ( 1 2 η(x) − η(x)))) D ¯ψDψ =exp ( ie2 2π ∫ d2xη(x)(∂μ∂μη(x))) D ¯ψDψ =exp (− ie2 2π ∫ d2x∂μη(x)∂μη(x)) D ¯ψDψ =exp ( ie2 2π ∫ d2xϵμν∂νη(x)ϵμλ∂λη(x)) D ¯ψDψ =exp ( ie2 2π ∫ d2xAμ(x)Aμ(x)) D ¯ψDψ. (13.148) Thus we see that if we make a ﬁnite chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition to decou- ple the fermions, there is a change in the functional measure leading to the generating functional Z = ∫ DAμD ¯ψDψeiSeﬀ , (13.149) where Seﬀ = ∫ d2x [− 1 4 FμνF μν + e2 2π AμAμ + i ¯ψγμ∂μψ] . (13.150) This shows again that the photon becomes massive in this theory and the fermions decouple completely from the spectrum. (This eﬀective Lagrangian density is local because we have chosen to work in the January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 350 340 13 Anomalies Landau gauge ∂μAμ = 0 which sets the nonlocal terms to zero in Eq. (13.107).) In this method, we see that the solubility of the model is closely related to the Jacobian of the chiral ﬁeld redeﬁnition that decouples the fermions. This, in turn, is connected with the anomaly of the system. This method can be extended to a very general class of two dimensional Abelian models which reduce to diﬀerent known models in diﬀerent limits. 13.3 References S. Adler,Phys. Rev. 177, 2426 (1969).

January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 351 Chapter 14 Systems at ﬁnite temperature 14.1 Statistical mechanics Let us review very brieﬂy various concepts from statistical mechan- ics. Let us consider not one quantum mechanical system, but a whole collection of identical quantum systems — an ensemble. Thus, for example, it can be an ensemble of oscillators or any other physical system. Let us further assume for simplicity that the physical sys- tem under consideration has discrete eigenvalues of energy. Each physical system in this ensemble can, of course, be in any eigenstate of energy and, therefore, there will be a distribution of the systems in the ensemble in diﬀerent energy eigenstates. As a result, we can deﬁne pn to represent the probability of ﬁnding a system in the en- semble to be in an energy eigenstate |n⟩ with energy En.This is, of course, completely statistical in the sense that pn can be identiﬁed simply with the number of physical systems in the state |n⟩ divided by the total number of systems in the ensemble. Such a situation is quite physical as we know from our studies in statistical mechanics. Namely, we may have an ensemble of physical systems in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath described by a thermal probability dis- tribution (Boltzmann distribution). For any quantum mechanical ensemble with a given probability distribution pn, the value of any observable quantity averaged over the entire ensemble (ensemble average) will take the form ⟨A⟩ = ¯A = ∑ n pn⟨n|A|n⟩ = ∑ n pnAn , (14.1) where we are assuming that the energy eigenstates are normalized and that 341 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 352 342 14 Systems at finite temperature An = ⟨n|A|n⟩ , (14.2) denotes the expectation value of the operator A in the quantum me- chanical state |n⟩. Thus, there are two kinds of averaging involved here. First, we have the average of the observable in a quantum state (expectation value) and second, we have the average of the expecta- tion value with respect to the probability distribution of systems in the ensemble. Being a probability, pn has to satisfy certain conditions. Namely, 0 ≤ pn ≤ 1, for all n, ∑ n pn =1 . (14.3) It is diﬃcult to determine the probability distribution for a general ensemble. However, if we are dealing with a thermodynamic ensem- ble, namely, an ensemble interacting with a large heat bath, and if we allow suﬃcient time for it to achieve thermal equilibrium, then we know that the probability distribution, in this case, is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Namely, in this case, we can write pn = 1 Z e− En kT . (14.4) Here En is the energy of the nth quantum state, k is the Boltzmann constant and T the equilibrium temperature of the system. The normalization factor Z in Eq. (14.4) can be determined from the relations for the probabilities in Eq. (14.3) as ∑ n pn =1, or, 1 Z ∑ n e− En kT =1, or,Z = ∑ n e− En kT = ∑ n e−βEn = ∑ n ⟨n|e−βH |n⟩, or,Z(β)=Tr e−βH , (14.5) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 353 14.1 Statistical mechanics 343 wherewehavedeﬁned β = 1 kT . (14.6) Z(β) is known as the partition function of the system and plays a fundamental role in deriving the thermodynamic properties of the system. For a statistical thermal ensemble, it is easy to see that the thermodynamic average (ensemble average) of any quantity deﬁned in Eq. (14.1) will be given by ⟨A⟩β = ∑ n pn⟨n|A|n⟩ = 1 Z(β) ∑ n e−βEn⟨n|A|n⟩ = 1 Z(β) ∑ n ⟨n|e−βH A|n⟩ = 1 Z(β) Tr (e−βH A) = Tr (e−βH A) Tr e−βH . (14.7) This allows us to deﬁne an operator known as the density operator or the density matrix ρ(β)= 1 Z(β) e−βH , (14.8) so that the thermal average of any operator can be written as ⟨A⟩β =Tr (ρ(β)A)= 1 Z(β) Tr (e−βH A). (14.9) In particular, the average energy associated with a system in the ensemble follows from Eq. (14.7) to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 354 344 14 Systems at finite temperature ⟨H⟩β = U = Tr (e−βH H) Tr e−βH = − ∂ ∂β Tr e−βH Tr e−βH = 1 Z(β) (− ∂Z(β) ∂β ) = − ∂ ln Z(β) ∂β . (14.10) This is also known as the average internal energy associated with the ensemble. The amount of order or the lack of it in an ensemble is deﬁned through the entropy as S = − ∑ n pn ln pn = −⟨ln p⟩ . (14.11) By deﬁnition, it is clear that the entropy is always positive semi- deﬁnite since 0 ≤ pn ≤ 1. Furthermore, its value is zero only for a pure ensemble for which pn = δnm, for a ﬁxed m. (14.12) For such an ensemble, all the individual systems are in the same energy state and, therefore, it is an ordered ensemble. On the other hand, the larger the number of states over which the physical systems are distributed, the more disordered the ensemble becomes and the entropy increases. For a thermodynamic ensemble, as we have seen in Eq. (14.4), pn = 1 Z(β) e−βEn . (14.13) Therefore, we can calculate the entropy of the ensemble to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 355 14.1 Statistical mechanics 345 S = −⟨ln p⟩β = − ∑ n pn ln pn = − ∑ n pn(−βEn − ln Z(β)) = β ∑ n pnEn +ln Z(β) ∑ n pn = βU +ln Z(β) = −β ∂ ln Z(β) ∂β +ln Z(β) = −β2 ∂ ∂β ( 1 β ln Z(β)) . (14.14) Here we have used Eqs. (14.10) and (14.3) in the intermediate steps. Given the internal energy U and the entropy S, the free energy for an ensemble can be deﬁned as F (β)= U − S β = − ∂ ln Z(β) ∂β + ∂ ln Z(β) ∂β − 1 β ln Z(β) = − 1 β ln Z(β) . (14.15) In terms of the free energy we can deﬁne the other thermodynamical quantities as U = − ∂ ln Z(β) ∂β = ∂(βF ) ∂β = F + β ∂F ∂β , S = −β2 ∂ ∂β ( 1 β ln Z(β)) = β2 ∂F ∂β . (14.16) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 356 346 14 Systems at finite temperature It is also interesting to note from Eq. (14.15) that the partition func- tion takes a particularly simple form when expressed in terms of the free energy. Namely, we can write Z(β)= e−βF (β) , (14.17) and this is quite reminiscent of the relation between the generating functionals Z and W (in Euclidean space) that we have studied ear- lier. We have gone over some of these concepts in some detail in order to bring out the essential similarities with the concepts of path integral that we have been discussing so far. One of the major interests in the study of statistical mechan- ics is the question of phase transitions in physical systems. Phase transitions are all too familiar to us from our studies of the diﬀerent phases of water. Even in solids such as magnets, the hysteresis eﬀect or the eﬀect of spontaneous magnetization provides an example of a phase transition. Namely, we know that below the Curie tempera- ture Tc, if a magnetic material is subjected to an external magnetic ﬁeld, then the material develops a residual magnetization even when theexternalﬁeldisswitchedoﬀ. Theamountofresidualmagnetiza- tion decreases as the temperature of the system approaches the Curie temperature and vanishes at Tc.For T> Tc, the system exhibits no spontaneous magnetization. Therefore, the temperature T = Tc is a critical temperature separating the diﬀerent phases of a magnetic material. The behavior of physical systems near the critical point is of great signiﬁcance. This can be studied from the point of view of statistical mechanics quite well. They can also be studied with equal ease using the concepts of path integrals. However, before we dis- cuss the applications of path integrals to statistical mechanics, let us recapitulate how one uses statistical mechanics to study critical phenomena. 14.2 Critical exponents Let us discuss the critical exponents in the context of a speciﬁc model which explains the properties of magnetization quite well. This model goes under the name of the planar Ising model or the Ising model in two dimensions (which we will study in the next chapter). January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 357 14.2 Critical exponents 347 The crucial feature of this model is that it ascribes the magnetic properties of a material to its spin content. In fact, this is quite reasonable from our studies of microscopic systems where we know that elementary particles with a nontrivial spin (and charge) possess magnetic dipole moments Let us consider a square lattice with equal spacing along both x and y directions. Let us also assume that at each lattice site labeled by n =(n1,n2), there is a spin S(n) which can either point up or down. Accordingly, we assume S(n)= { 1 for spin up, −1 for spin down. (14.18) Furthermore, let us assume that the spins interact as locally as is possible. In fact, the Hamiltonian for the planar Ising model is taken to be H = −J ∑ n,ˆμ S(n)S(n +ˆμ) , (14.19) where we have assumed a simpliﬁed coupling for the problem. Here ˆμ stands for either of the two unit vectors (along x or y axis) on the lattice. In simple language, then, the Ising model assumes nearest neighbor interaction between the spins which are supposed to be pointing only along the z-axis. The constant J measures the strength of the spin-spin interaction. It is clear that if its value is positive, then a minimum of the energy will be obtained when all the spins are pointing along the same direction — either up or down. Accordingly, such a coupling is known as a ferromagnetic coupling. Conversely, if J is negative, then the coupling is known as anti-ferromagnetic. It is worth pointing out here that the Hamiltonian for the Ising model has a discrete symmetry in the sense that if we ﬂip all the spins of the system, then the Hamiltonian does not change. Let us next subject this spin system to a constant external mag- netic ﬁeld B (this is like the external source we have discussed in connection with path integrals). In this case, the Hamiltonian be- comes January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 358 348 14 Systems at finite temperature H = −J ∑ n,ˆμ S(n)S(n +ˆμ)+ B ∑ n S(n) . (14.20) The partition function deﬁned in Eqs. (14.5) and (14.17), for the present case, takes the form Z(β, B)= e−βF (β,B) =Tr e−βH = ∑ conﬁg e−βEconﬁg . (14.21) The summation, here, is over all possible spin conﬁgurations on the lattice and Econﬁg denotes the energy associated with each such spin conﬁguration. Let us note that at every lattice site, the spin can take two possible values. Consequently, if N denotes the total number of lattice points (lattice sites), then there are 2N possible spin conﬁg- urations over which the summation in Eq. (14.21) has to be carried out. The true partition function, of course, has to be calculated in the thermodynamic limit when N →∞. Let us note now from Eqs. (14.20) and (14.21) that, in this case, we have ∂Z ∂B = −β ∂F ∂B Z =Tr ( −β (∑ n S(n) ) e−βH ) , or, ∂F ∂B = 1 Z Tr ((∑ n S(n) ) e−βH ) = 〈∑ n S(n) 〉 β = ∑ n ⟨S(n)⟩β . (14.22) Using the translation invariance of the theory (lattice), we can write ⟨S(n)⟩β = ⟨S(0)⟩β , (14.23) so that we obtain ∂F ∂B = ∑ n ⟨S(n)⟩β = N ⟨S(0)⟩β . (14.24) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 359 14.2 Critical exponents 349 This gives the total magnetization for the lattice and the mean mag- netization per site can be obtained to be M (β, B)= 1 N ∑ n ⟨S(n)⟩β = ⟨S(0)⟩β = 1 N ∂F ∂B . (14.25) This is, of course, a function of both the temperature and the applied magnetic ﬁeld and its value can be calculated once we know the free energy or the partition function. The magnetic susceptibility is proportional to the rate of change of magnetization with the applied ﬁeld and is deﬁned to be χ = − ∂M ∂B ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣B=0 = − 1 N ∂2F ∂B2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣B=0 = β N ⎛ ⎝∑ n,m ⟨S(n)S(m)⟩β − (∑ n ⟨S(n)⟩β )2⎞ ⎠ B=0 = β N ( N ∑ n ⟨S(n)S(0)⟩β − N 2(⟨S(0)⟩β)2) B=0 = β (∑ n ⟨S(n)S(0)⟩β − N (⟨S(0)⟩β)2) B=0 , (14.26) where we have used Eqs. (14.22) and (14.23). Thus, we see that the magnetic susceptibility is related to the ﬂuctuations in the spin while the magnetization is given by the average value of spin. The suscep- tibility is large at those temperatures where the correlation between the spins is large. Note that if the system has no net magnetization, i.e., no spontaneous magnetization (when the external magnetic ﬁeld is switched oﬀ), namely, if ⟨S(0)⟩β|B=0 =0 , (14.27) then, the magnetic susceptibility is completely determined by the spin-spin correlation function. In other words, in this case we have χ = β ∑ n ⟨S(n)S(0)⟩β∣ ∣ ∣B=0 . (14.28) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 360 350 14 Systems at finite temperature If, for some low temperature T< Tc (β> βc), we ﬁnd in our spin system that ⟨S(0)⟩β|B=0 ̸=0 , (14.29) then, the system shows spontaneous magnetization or residual mag- netization. In this case, we note that the discrete symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken. The spontaneous magnetization vanishes as we approach the critical temperature and for T> Tc (β< βc), the system will show no spontaneous magnetization simply because the random thermal motion will dominate. The behavior of spontaneous magnetization near the critical temperature, namely, how the magnetization vanishes as the temperature approaches the critical temperature M |B=0 ∼ (T − Tc)β , (14.30) can be calculated once we know the partition function. Let us em- phasize here that the parameter β in the exponent in Eq. (14.30) is not 1 kT which was deﬁned earlier but represents a critical expo- nent. (The notation is unfortunate, but this is the convention.) The spontaneous magnetization deﬁnes an order parameter for the phase transition in the sense that its value separates the two diﬀerent phases of the physical system. We can similarly calculate the correlation length ξ(T ) between the spins at any temperature by analyzing the magnetic susceptibil- ity. For very high temperatures, it is clear that the random thermal motion will not allow any appreciable correlation between the spins. However, as the temperature of the system is lowered to the critical temperature, the system may develop long range correlations and the behavior of the correlation length near the critical temperature is parameterized by another critical exponent of the form ξ(T ) ∼ (T − Tc)−ν . (14.31) The magnetic susceptibility may similarly become large at this point and its behavior near the critical temperature is parameterized by yet another critical exponent as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 361 14.3 Harmonic oscillator 351 χ(T ) ∼ (T − Tc)−γ . (14.32) Similarly, other thermodynamic quantities in the system such as the speciﬁc heat deﬁned as C = −T ∂2F ∂T 2 , (14.33) may also display a singular behavior at the critical point and all these can be calculated once we know the partition function or the free energy of the system. 14.3 Harmonic oscillator The direct calculation of the partition function for the one dimen- sional quantum harmonic oscillator is quite straightforward. We know that for an oscillator with a natural frequency ω, the energy levels are given by En = ω (n + 1 2 ) ,n =0, 1, 2, ··· , (14.34) where we have set ℏ = 1. For this system then, the partition function can be derived using Eqs. (14.5) and (14.34) to be Z(β)=Tr e−βH = ∞∑ n=0 e−βEn = ∞∑ n=0 e−βω(n+ 1 2 ) = e− βω 2 ( ∞∑ n=0 e−βωn) = e− βω 2 ( 1 1 − e−βω ) = 1 e βω 2 − e− βω 2 = 1 2sinh βω 2 . (14.35) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 362 352 14 Systems at finite temperature Since we know the partition function, we can calculate the thermo- dynamic properties of the system. Let us next see how we can calculate the partition function for the harmonic oscillator using the path integral method. Let us recall that we have already calculated the transition amplitude for the harmonic oscillator which has the form (see Eq. (3.71)) ⟨xf ,T |xi, 0⟩ = ⟨xf |e−iHT |xi⟩ = N ∫ DxeiS[x], or, ⟨xf |e−iHT |xi⟩ = ( mω 2πi sin ωT ) 1 2 eiS[xcl] , (14.36) and we have determined earlier that (see Eq. (3.91) with J =0) S[xcl]= mω 2sin ωT [(x2 i + x2 f )cos ωT − 2xixf ] . (14.37) We recall that we have set ℏ =1, J = 0 in the above equations and T here denotes the time interval between the initial and the ﬁnal points of the trajectory. On the other hand, from the deﬁnition of the partition function, Z(β)=Tr e−βH , (14.38) we note that the trace can be taken in any basis. In particular, if we choose the coordinate basis in the Schr¨odinger picture, then we can write Z(β)= ∞∫ −∞ dx ⟨x|e−βH |x⟩ . (14.39) We now recognize the integrand in Eq. (14.39) merely as the transi- tion amplitude (see Eq. (1.47)) (it is actually an expectation value as we have discussed earlier) for the harmonic oscillator with the identiﬁcation T = −iβ, xf = xi = x. (14.40) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 363 14.3 Harmonic oscillator 353 In other words, the integrand really is the transition amplitude be- tween the same coordinate state in the Euclidean time with β = 1 kT (T is the temperature here) playing the role of the Euclidean time interval. Using this, then, we obtain from Eq. (14.39) Z(β)= ∞∫ −∞ dx ( mω 2πi(−i sinh βω) ) 1 2 × e ( imω 2(−i sinh βω) (2x2 cosh βω−2x2)) = ( mω 2π sinh βω ) 1 2 ∞∫ −∞ dxe−( mω sinh βω (cosh βω−1)x2) = ( mω 2π sinh βω ) 1 2 ∞∫ −∞ dxe−(mω tanh βω 2 )x2 = ( mω 2π sinh βω ) 1 2 ( π mω tanh βω 2 ) 1 2 = ( 1 2sinh βω tanh βω 2 ) 1 2 = ( 1 4sinh2 βω 2 ) 1 2 = 1 2sinh βω 2 . (14.41) This is, of course, the partition function which we had found by a direct calculation in Eq. (14.35). Let us note next that since Z(β)= e−βF = 1 2sinh βω 2 , (14.42) we obtain F = − 1 β ln Z = 1 β (ln 2 + ln sinh βω 2 ) . (14.43) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 364 354 14 Systems at finite temperature Consequently, we note from Eq. (14.16) that ⟨H⟩β = U = ∂(βF ) ∂β = − ∂ ln Z ∂β = ω 2 cosh βω 2 sinh βω 2 = ω 2 e βω 2 + e− βω 2 e βω 2 − e− βω 2 = ω 2 eβω +1 eβω − 1 , or, ⟨H⟩β = U = ω 2 + ω eβω − 1 . (14.44) This is exactly what we would have obtained from Planck’s law (re- member that ℏ = 1). Among other things, it tells us that for low temperatures or large β,wehave ⟨H⟩β = U ≃ ω 2 . (14.45) Namely, in such a case, the oscillators (in the ensemble) remain in the ground state. On the other hand, for very high temperatures or small β,weget ⟨H⟩β = U ≃ ω 2 + ω βω ≃ 1 β = kT . (14.46) This is a manifestation of the equipartition of energy. (We expect the system to behave in a classical manner at very high temperature.) This analysis of the derivation of the partition function for the harmonic oscillator from the path integral is quite instructive. It shows that the path integral for a (D + 1)-dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory can be related to the partition function of a D-dimensional quantum statistical system when the Euclidean time interval is identiﬁed with β = 1 kT as in Eq. (14.40). In fact, the relation between the two for a bosonic ﬁeld theory can be written as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 365 14.3 Harmonic oscillator 355 Z(β)= N ∫ φ(0)=φ(β) Dφe−SE = N ∫ φ(0)=φ(β) Dφe− β∫ 0 dt ∫ dDxLE . (14.47) Here we are assuming integration over the end points which is equiva- lent to taking the trace. Furthermore, we note that the ﬁeld variables, in this path integral, are assumed to satisfy a periodic boundary con- dition φ(0) = φ(β) . (14.48) This, as is clear, arises from the trace in the deﬁnition of the partition function. A careful analysis for the fermions shows that the partition function, in such a case, can be written exactly in the same manner but with anti-periodic boundary conditions. Namely, for fermions, we have Z(β)= N ∫ D ¯ψDψe−SE [ψ, ¯ψ] = N ∫ D ¯ψDψe− β∫ 0 dt ∫ dDx LE [ψ, ¯ψ] , (14.49) with the boundary conditions ψ(0) = −ψ(β), ¯ψ(0) = − ¯ψ(β) . (14.50) These boundary conditions can be shown to be related to the question of quantum statistics associated with the diﬀerent systems. This way of describing a quantum statistical system in equilibrium through a Euclidean path integral is known as the Matsubara formalism or the imaginary time formalism (since we rotate to imaginary time). Let January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 366 356 14 Systems at finite temperature us note here without going into details that there exist other for- malisms which allow for the presence of both time and temperature in the theory simultaneously. These go under the name of real time formalisms. The Matsubara formalism (the imaginary time formalism) also suggests that a (D + 1)-dimensional bosonic Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory can be related to a (D + 1)-dimensional classical statistical system in the following way. Let us consider a quantum mechanical system described by the Lagrangian L = 1 2 m ˙x2 − V (x) . (14.51) Then, the generating functional for such a system will have the form (we use t to denote the time interval to avoid any confusion with temperature) Z = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ S[x] = N ∫ Dxe i ℏ t∫ 0 dtL . (14.52) Here we have put back Planck’s constant for reasons which will be clear shortly. If we rotate to Euclidean time, the generating func- tional takes the form Z = N ∫ Dxe− 1 ℏ t∫ 0 dt( 1 2 m ˙x2+V (x)) . (14.53) This has precisely the form of a classical partition function if we identify H = t∫ 0 dt ( 1 2 m ˙x2 + V (x)) (14.54) as governing the dynamics of the system and ℏ = kT = 1 β . (14.55) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 367 14.4 Fermionic oscillator 357 Here we should note that the variable, t, inthiscaseshouldbetreated as a space variable and not as a time. Let us also recall that the Planck’s constant measures quantum ﬂuctuations in a quantum me- chanical system whereas temperature measures thermal ﬂuctuations in a statistical system. The identiﬁcation of the two above, therefore, relates the quantum ﬂuctuations in a quantum mechanical system with the thermal ﬂuctuations in a corresponding classical statistical system. This connection can be simply extended to a ﬁeld theory where the Euclidean action would act as the Hamiltonian for the corresponding classical statistical system. 14.4 Fermionic oscillator Let us next calculate the partition function for a fermionic oscillator with a natural frequency ω, using both the path integrals and the standard methods. We note from our discussion in Section 5.1 that the Hilbert space for the fermionic oscillator is quite simple. In fact, from Eqs. (5.13) and (5.14), we note that it is like a two level system with energy eigenvalues E0 = − ω 2 , E1 = ω 2 . (14.56) Once again, we have set ℏ = 1 for simplicity here. Using Eq. (14.56) it follows from the deﬁnition of the partition function in Eq. (14.5) that for the fermionic oscillator we have Z(β)=Tr e−βH = e−βE0 + e−βE1 = e βω 2 + e− βω 2 = 2 cosh βω 2 . (14.57) The evaluation of the partition function for the fermionic os- cillator, in the path integral method, follows from the form of the transition amplitude derived in Eq. (5.99). Following our discussion in the last section, we note that in the case of fermions, we have to impose anti-periodic boundary conditions (see Eq. (14.50)), namely, for the calculation of the partition function, we require (T →−iβ) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 368 358 14 Systems at finite temperature ψf = −ψi , ¯ψf = − ¯ψi . (14.58) We can now calculate the partition function for the system with the identiﬁcations in Eqs. (14.40) and (14.58) as well as the result in Eq. (5.99) as Z(β)= ∫ d ¯ψidψi (e βω 2 e(−e−βω ¯ψiψi− ¯ψiψi)) = e βω 2 ∫ d ¯ψidψi (1 − (1 + e−βω) ¯ψiψi) = e βω 2 (1+ e−βω) =2 cosh βω 2 . (14.59) Here we have used the nilpotency properties of Grassmann variables (see Eq. (5.18)) as well as the integration rules given in Eqs. (5.27) and (5.28). This is exactly the same result which we had obtained earlier in Eq. (14.57) for the partition function of the system. We note now from the deﬁnition in Eq. (14.15) that the free energy for the fermionic oscillator is given by F (β)= − 1 β ln Z(β)= − 1 β (ln 2 + ln cosh βω 2 ) . (14.60) The average energy for the ensemble can now be calculated from Eq. (14.16) to be ⟨H⟩β = U = ∂(βF ) ∂β = − ω 2 sinh βω 2 cosh βω 2 = − ω 2 e βω 2 − e− βω 2 e βω 2 + e− βω 2 , = − ω 2 eβω − 1 eβω +1 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 369 14.5 References 359 or, ⟨H⟩β = U = − ω 2 + ω eβω +1 . (14.61) It now follows that for low temperatures or large β (β = 1 kT ), we have ⟨H⟩β = U ≃− ω 2 . (14.62) Namely, the system likes to remain in the ground state for low tem- peratures whereas for high temperatures or small β, we obtain ⟨H⟩β = U ≃− ω 2 + ω 2+ βω = − ω 2 + ω 2 (1+ βω 2 )−1 ≃− ω 2 + ω 2 − βω2 4 = − βω2 4 = − ω2 4kT . (14.63) In this case, we see that the average energy of the system goes to zero inversely with the temperature which amounts to saying that the system tries to populate equally the two available energy states. 14.5 References A.

The Hamiltonian for spins interacting through nearest neighbors on a one dimensional lattice (chain) is given by H = −J N∑ i=1 sisi+1 + B N∑ i=1 si = −J N∑ i=1 sisi+1 + B N∑ i=1 1 2 (si + si+1) . (15.1) Here we have assumed that the total number of lattice sites is N and that the spin system is being subjected to a constant external magnetic ﬁeld B. Furthermore, we assume periodic condition on the lattice (cyclicity condition), namely, sN +1 = s1 . (15.2) The spins take values si = ±1 representing the fact that they can either point “up” or “down”. The classical partition function for this system is, by deﬁnition, Z(β)= ∑ si=±1 e−βH = ∑ si=±1 e ( βJ N∑ i=1 sisi+1−βB N∑ i=1 1 2 (si+si+1) ) .

Let us consider the quantum mechanical system described by the Hamiltonian Hq = −ασ1 + γσ3 , (15.4) where σ1 and σ3 are the two Pauli matrices and α and γ are two ar- bitrary real constant parameters. Let |s⟩ denote the two component eigenstates of σ3 such that (they correspond to the two dimensional column matrices (1 0 ) and (0 1 )) σ3|s⟩ = s|s⟩,s = ±1 . (15.5) We can now calculate the Euclidean transition amplitude for the quantum system described by Eq. (15.4) between two eigenstates of σ3,namely, ⟨sﬁn|e−THq |sin⟩ . (15.6) Dividing the time interval T into N steps of inﬁnitesimal length ϵ such that (for large N ) Nϵ = T, (15.7) and introducing a complete set of eigenstates of σ3 at every interme- diate point, we obtain ⟨sﬁn|e−THq |sin⟩ = ∑ si=±1⟨sN +1|e−ϵHq |sN ⟩⟨sN |e−ϵHq |sN −1⟩···⟨s2|e−ϵHq |s1⟩ , (15.8) where the intermediate sums are over the intermediate points i = 2, 3,...,N .

(15.9) Note that if ϵ is small, then we can expand the individual ex- ponents in Eq. (15.8) and write ⟨si+1|e−ϵHq |si⟩≃⟨si+1|(\u0000 − ϵHq))|si⟩ = ⟨si+1|(\u0000 + ϵασ1 − ϵγσ3)|si⟩ . (15.10) Using the relations, ⟨si+1|si⟩ = ( 1 2 (si + si+1))2 = 1 2 (1 + sisi+1), ⟨si+1|σ1|si⟩ = ( 1 2 (si − si+1))2 = 1 2 (1 − sisi+1), ⟨si+1|σ3|si⟩ = 1 2 (si + si+1) , (15.11) which can be explicitly checked, we obtain ⟨si+1|e−ϵHq |si⟩ ≃ ( 1 2 (si + si+1))2 + ϵα ( 1 2 (si − si+1))2 − ϵγ 1 2 (si + si+1) . (15.12) Let us next see if the right hand side of Eq. (15.12) can be written as an exponential. From the fact that for any i, si = ±1, we also have the following identities.

(15.13) Using the relations in Eq. (15.13), then, we can obtain (for constant parameters δ and Δ) e (Δ( 1 2 (si−si+1))2+δ 1 2 (si+si+1)) =1 + ∞∑ n=1 1 n!

(15.14) Let us now use the algebraic relation ( 1 2 (si + si+1))2 + ( 1 2 (si − si+1))2 =1 , (15.15) which allows us to write Eq. (15.14) also as e (Δ( 1 2 (si−si+1))2+δ 1 2 (si+si+1)) = cosh δ ( 1 2 (si + si+1))2 + eΔ ( 1 2 (si − si+1))2 +sinh δ ( 1 2 (si + si+1)) . (15.16) We note that this has precisely the same form as the transition amplitude between two neighboring sites in Eq. (15.12) provided we make the identiﬁcation cosh δ = eδ + e−δ 2 =1 , eΔ = ϵα , sinh δ = eδ − e−δ 2 = −ϵγ . (15.17) Equivalently, with the identiﬁcation eΔ = ϵα, eδ =1 − ϵγ , (15.18) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 376 366 15 Ising model we can write ⟨si+1|e−ϵHq |si⟩ = e (Δ( 1 2 (si−si+1))2+δ 1 2 (si+si+1)) . (15.19) Consequently, using this identiﬁcation, we obtain (here summation over the end points is assumed) Tr e−THq= ∑ si=±1⟨s1|e−ϵHq |sN ⟩⟨sN |e−ϵHq |sN −1⟩···⟨s2|e−ϵHq |s1⟩ = ∑ si=±1 e ( Δ N∑ i=1( 1 2 (si−si+1))2+δ N∑ i=1 1 2 (si+si+1) ) = ∑ si=±1 e ( Δ N∑ i=1 1 2 (1−sisi+1)+δ N∑ i=1 1 2 (si+si+1) ) = e N Δ 2 ∑ si=±1 e ( − Δ 2 N∑ i=1 sisi+1+δ N∑ i=1 1 2 (si+si+1) ) = e N Δ 2 ∑ si=±1 e ( βJ N∑ i=1 sisi+1−βB N∑ i=1 1 2 (si+si+1) ) = e N Δ 2 ∑ si=±1 e−βH , (15.20) provided we identify Δ= −2βJ, δ = −βB . (15.21) With these identiﬁcations, then we see that we can write Tr e−THq = e−NβJ Z(β) , (15.22) where Z(β) represents the partition function for the one dimensional ising model. Once again, this shows that the quantum ﬂuctuations in a quantum theory can be related to the thermal ﬂuctuations of a classical statistical system. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 377 15.2 The partition function 367 15.2 The partition function To evaluate the partition function for the one dimensional Ising model explicitly, let us rewrite the exponent in Eq. (15.3) in the partition function in a way that is easy to use. Note that e(βJsisi+1−βB 1 2 (si+si+1)) = e(−2βJ× 1 2 (−1+1−sisi+1)−βB 1 2 (si+si+1)) = eβJ e (−2βJ( 1 2 (si−si+1))2−βB 1 2 (si+si+1)) = eβJ [ cosh βB ( 1 2 (si + si+1))2 + e−2βJ ( 1 2 (si − si+1))2 − sinh βB 1 2 (si + si+1)] , (15.23) wherewehaveused theidentitiesinEq. (15.13). Itisnow clearthat if we deﬁne a matrix operator K = eβJ [cosh βB\u0000 + e−2βJ σ1 − sinh βB σ3] , (15.24) then, the matrix element of this operator between the eigenstates |si⟩ and |si+1⟩ of the σ3 operator will be obtained using Eq. (15.11) to be ⟨si+1|K|si⟩ = e(βJsisi+1−βB 1 2 (si+si+1)) . (15.25) Note that K is a 2 × 2 matrix and has the explicit form K = ( eβJ (cosh βB − sinh βB) e−βJ e−βJ eβJ (cosh βB +sinh βB) ) = ( eβ(J−B) e−βJ e−βJ eβ(J+B) ) . (15.26) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 378 368 15 Ising model From this analysis, it is clear that we can derive the partition function for the one dimensional Ising model explicitly as follows. Z(β)= ∑ si=±1 e ( βJ N∑ i=1 sisi+1−βB N∑ i=1 (si+si+1) 2 ) = ∑ si=±1⟨s1|K|sN ⟩⟨sN |K|sN −1⟩···⟨s2|K|s1⟩ =Tr KN = λN 1 + λN 2 , (15.27) where λ1 and λ2 are the two eigenvalues of the matrix K in Eq. (15.26). The eigenvalues of the matrix K can be easily obtained from det(K − λI)=0, or, det ( eβ(J−B) − λe−βJ e−βJ eβ(J+B) − λ ) =0, or,λ2 − 2λeβJ cosh βB + e2βJ − e−2βJ =0 . (15.28) This is a quadratic equation whose solutions are easily obtained to be λ = eβJ cosh βB ± (e2βJ cosh2 βB − e2βJ + e−2βJ ) 1 2 = eβJ cosh βB ± (e2βJ (1 + sinh2 βB) − e2βJ + e−2βJ ) 1 2 = eβJ (cosh βB ± (sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 ) . (15.29) If we identify the two eigenvalues as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 379 15.2 The partition function 369 λ1 = eβJ (cosh βB + (sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 ) , λ2 = eβJ (cosh βB − (sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 ) , (15.30) then, we note that since λ1 >λ2, for large N , we can approximately write Z(β)=Tr KN = λN 1 + λN 2 ≃ λN 1 = [eβJ (cosh βB +(sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 )]N . (15.31) This method of evaluating the partition function is known as the matrix method and we recognize K as the transfer matrix for the system (see also Section 3.3). We can now derive various quantities of thermodynamic inter- est. Let us note from Eq. (15.31) that we can write ln Z(β)= N ln [eβJ (cosh βB +(sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 )] = N [βJ +ln {cosh βB +(sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 }] . (15.32) Therefore, the average magnetization per site deﬁned in Eq. (14.25) can now be derived from Eq. (15.32) to be M = 1 N ∂F ∂B = 1 N ∂ ∂B (− 1 β ln Z(β)) = − 1 Nβ ∂ ln Z(β) ∂B = − 1 Nβ N ( β sinh βB + 1 2 2β sinh βB cosh βB (sinh2 βB+e−4βJ) 1 2 ) cosh βB + (sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 = − sinh βB (sinh2 βB + e−4βJ ) 1 2 . (15.33) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 380 370 15 Ising model It is interesting to note that when the external magnetic ﬁeld is switched oﬀ, the magnetization vanishes. In this one dimensional system, therefore, there is no spontaneous magnetization and con- sequently, it cannot describe the properties of a magnet. The mag- netic susceptibility for such a system can also be easily calculated (see Eq. (14.26)) and takes the form χ = − ∂M ∂B ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣B=0 = βe2βJ . (15.34) This shows that for |2βJ| < 1, the susceptibility obeys Curie’s law. Namely, in this case, χ ≃ β = 1 kT . (15.35) The absence of spontaneous magnetization in the present sys- tem may appear puzzling because naively, we would expect the con- ﬁgurations where all the spins are “up” or “down” to correspond to minimum energy states (for J> 0). These, being ordered, we would have expected a nontrivial spontaneous magnetization for the sys- tem. The lack of magnetization can actually be understood through the instanton calculation which we discussed earlier. Let us recall that for the double-well potential (see Section 7.4 as well as Chapter 8) the two naive ground states would give ⟨x⟩ = ±a. (15.36) On the other hand, as we have seen earlier in Eq. (7.59), the true ground stateisamixtureofthese twostates(thesymmetric state) such that ⟨x⟩true =0 .

In this case, we showed explicitly that the tunneling or the presence of instanton states contributes signiﬁcantly leading to the mixing of the states and restoring the symmetry. In the one dimensional Ising spin system, we can correspond- ingly think of the following two spin conﬁgurations ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑, ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓, as denoting the two ground states for which the magnetization is nonzero ⟨M ⟩β ̸=0 . (15.38) However, in the present case, there are other spin conﬁgurations such as ↑↑↑↑↓↓↓↓↓ −one kink or one instanton, ↑↑↑↓↓↓↑↑↑ −two kinks or one instanton-anti-instanton, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 382 372 15 Ising model and so on which contribute signiﬁcantly. Even though these conﬁg- urations have higher energy, they are also more disordered. Con- sequently, they have a higher entropy and as a result can have a lower free energy. (It is worth recalling that in a thermodynamic ensemble, it is the free energy and not the energy which plays the dominant role.) As a consequence of the contributions from these spin conﬁgurations, the true ensemble average of magnetization van- ishes. Namely, ⟨M ⟩true β =0 . (15.39) This qualitative discussion can actually be made more precise through the use of path integrals. Finally, let us note here that as we have discussed earlier, path integrals are deﬁned by discretizing space-time variables. In fact, space-time lattices are often used to deﬁne a regularized quantum ﬁeld theory. The continuum theory is, of course, obtained in the limit when the lattice spacing goes to zero. Viewed in this way, the spin Hamiltonian is seen to have the continuum limit H = −J ∑ i sisi+1 + B ∑ i si = J 2 ∑ i (si+1 − si)2 + B 2 ∑ i (si + si+1) − NJ −→ continuum ∫ dx( α 2 (∂s(x))2 + γs(x) ) + constant. (15.40) where α and γ are two constants. Namely, we can think of the one dimensional Ising model as corresponding to a one dimensional free scalar ﬁeld theory interacting with a constant external source in the continuum limit. 15.3 Two dimensional Ising model Let us next consider a two dimensional array of spins on a square lattice interacting through nearest neighbors. Once again, let us use periodic boundary conditions along both the axes so that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 383 15.3 Two dimensional Ising model 373 s1,i2 = sN +1,i2,si1,1 = si1,N +1 , (15.41) where we are using the notation that i =(i1,i2) denotes a point on the two dimensional lattice and we are assuming that N denotes the total number of lattice sites along any axis. \u0000 (i1,i2) The total number of points on the lattice is then obtained to be n = N 2 . (15.42) The spins are assumed to take only the values ±1, namely, si = si1,i2 = ±1, for all i1,i2 , (15.43) corresponding to the fact that they can only point “up” or “down”. The Hamiltonian describing the interaction of the spins is given by (see also Eq. (14.20)) H = −J ∑ ⟨ij⟩ sisj = −J N∑ i1,i2=1(si1,i2si1+1,i2 + si1,i2si1,i2+1) . (15.44) The symbol ⟨ij⟩ is introduced as a short hand for sites which are nearest neighbors and the coupling J is assumed to be positive. We can also think of the sum in Eq. (15.44) as being taken over all the January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 384 374 15 Ising model links of the lattice. (Remember that a link connects two nearest neighbors on a lattice.) The partition function for the system described by the Hamil- tonian in Eq. (15.44) can now be deﬁned to be Z(β)= ∑ si=±1 e−βH = ∑ si=±1 e ( βJ ∑ ⟨ij⟩ sisj ) = ∑ si=±1 e ( κ ∑ ⟨ij⟩ sisj ) = ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩ eκsisj , (15.45) where we have deﬁned for simplicity κ = βJ . (15.46) Note that we are discussing the simpler case where the spin system is not interacting with an external magnetic ﬁeld. This partition function, as it stands, appears to be only slightly more complicated than that for the one dimensional case in Eq. (15.3). However, as we will see, this partition function is much more diﬃcult to evaluate in closed form. Before going into the actual evaluation of this partition function, let us discuss some of the symmetries associated with this system. 15.4 Duality Let us note that since si = ±1 , (15.47) we can expand the exponent in the partition function in Eq. (15.45) to obtain eκsisj = cosh κ + sisj sinh κ = cosh κ (1 + sisj tanh κ) . (15.48) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 385 15.4 Duality 375 Therefore, we can also write Z(β)= ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩ eκsisj = ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩ cosh κ (1 + sisj tanh κ) = (cosh κ)2n ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩ (1 + sisj tanh κ) = (cosh κ)2n ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩ 1∑ l=0 (sisj tanh κ)l = (cosh κ)2n ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩ 1∑ l=0 (tanh κ)l(sisj)l . (15.49) We see that we can simplify this expression by assigning a (link) number lk = lij = lji =(0, 1) to each link between the sites i and j and rewriting Z(β) = (cosh κ)2n ∑ lk (tanh κ)l1+l2+··· ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩(sisj)lij . (15.50) Letusnextnotethatthe productonthe righthandsidein Eq. (15.50) can simply be understood as the product of the spins at each lattice site with an exponent corresponding to the sum of the link numbers for the four links meeting at that site. Namely, for nearest neighbors j ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩(sisj)lij = ∑ si=±1 ∏ i (si) ∑ j lij = ∑ si=±1 ∏ i (si)ni , (15.51) where we have deﬁned, for nearest neighbors j, ni = ∑ j lij . (15.52) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 386 376 15 Ising model The sum over the spin values can now be done to give ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩(sisj)lij = ∏ i ∑ si=±1(si)ni = ∏ i (1 + (−1)ni) . (15.53) It is clear that the expression in Eq. (15.53) vanishes when ni is odd. For even ni, on the other hand, it has the value ∑ si=±1 ∏ ⟨ij⟩(sisj)lij =2 n . (15.54) Putting everything back in Eq. (15.50), we obtain Z(β) = (2 cosh2 κ)n ∑ lk (tanh κ)l1+l2+··· = Z(κ) . (15.55) The constraint here is that the lk’s in Eq. (15.55) must satisfy ∑ j lij =0, mod 2 , (15.56) for any four links joining at a site. In other words, if l1, l2, l3 and l4 denote the link numbers for four links meeting at a common site, then l1 + l2 + l3 + l4 =0, mod 2 . (15.57) Let us next consider the dual lattice associated with our original lattice. It is constructed by placing a lattice site at the center of each plaquette of the original lattice. Thus, each plaquette of the dual lattice encloses a given site of the original lattice and intersects the four links originating from that site. Let us also deﬁne a dual variable σi at each site of the dual lattice and assume that it takes values ±1. Denoting by (1, 2, 3, 4) the sites of the dual lattice which enclose the point k of the original lattice, we note that for every link that is intersected by a dual link, we can deﬁne January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 387 15.4 Duality 377 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u000012 34 k Figure 15.2: A plaquette in the dual lattice. l1 = 1 2 (1 − σ1σ2) , l2 = 1 2 (1 − σ2σ3) , l3 = 1 2 (1 − σ3σ4) , l4 = 1 2 (1 − σ4σ1) . (15.58) We see that each of the lk’s have the value 0 or 1 as required. Fur- thermore, we also have l1 + l2 + l3 + l4 = 1 2 (4 − σ1σ2 − σ2σ3 − σ3σ4 − σ4σ1) = 1 2 (4 − (σ1 + σ3)(σ2 + σ4)) =0, mod 2 . (15.59) In other words, the constraint equation in Eq. (15.57) can be natu- rally solved through the dual lattice variables. Going back to the expression for the partition function derived in Eq. (15.55), we note that using Eq. (15.58) we can write (tanh κ)l1 = (tanh κ) 1 2 (1−σ1σ2) = e−κ∗(1−σ1σ2) , (15.60) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 388 378 15 Ising model wherewehavedeﬁned tanh κ = e−2κ∗ . (15.61) We note here that when κ = βJ is large, κ∗ is small and vice versa. Substituting this back into Eq. (15.55), we obtain Z(κ) = (2 cosh2 κ)n ∑ σi=±1 e ( −κ∗ ∑ ⟨ij⟩(1−σiσj ) ) = (2 cosh2 κ)ne−2nκ∗ ∑ σi=±1 e ( κ∗ ∑ ⟨ij⟩ σiσj ) , or, Z(κ) (2 cosh2 κ)n = e−2nκ∗ ∑ σi=±1 e ( κ∗ ∑ ⟨ij⟩ σiσj ) = Z(κ∗) (e2κ∗)n . (15.62) Using trigonometric identities, this can also be written as Z(κ) (sinh 2κ) n 2 = Z(κ∗) (sinh 2κ∗) n 2 . (15.63) The relation in Eq. (15.62) (or Eq. (15.63)) is quite interesting in that the relation tanh κ = e−2κ∗ , (15.64) which can also be written as sinh 2κ sinh 2κ∗ =1 , (15.65) deﬁnes a transformation between strong and weak couplings (or high and low temperatures (see Eq. (15.46))). And we ﬁnd that the cor- responding partition functions are related as well. Consequently, if there exists a single phase transition in this model (which was known from earlier general arguments due to Peirels), it must occur at a January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 389 15.5 High and low temperature expansions 379 uniquepoint where(note that κ or κc is positive as is clear from Eq. (15.64)) κ = κc = κ∗ c, or, sinh2 2κc =1, or, sinh 2κc =1, or,e2κc − e−2κc =2, or,e2κc = √2+1, or,κc = βcJ = 1 2 ln (√2+1) , or,βc = 1 2J ln (√2+1) . (15.66) 15.5 High and low temperature expansions Quite often in statistical mechanics, the partition function cannot be evaluated exactly for an arbitrary temperature. In such a case, we study ensemble averages of observables associated with the system as an expansion in temperature at very high temperatures as well as at very low temperatures to see if any meaningful conclusion regarding the system can be obtained. In the language of ﬁeld theory, we have seen in Eq. (14.55) that temperature can be related to Planck’s con- stant which in some sense measures the quantum coupling. There- fore, high and low temperature expansions are also known as strong and weak coupling expansions (or approximations). Let us go back to the partition function for the two dimensional Ising model Z(κ)= ∑ si=±1 e ( κ ∑ ⟨ij⟩ sisj ) , (15.67) where, as in Eq. (15.46), we have identiﬁed January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 390 380 15 Ising model κ = βJ = J kT . (15.68) We have seen in Eq. (15.55) that we can write Z(κ) (2 cosh2 κ)n = ∑ lk=0,1(tanh κ)l1+l2+··· , (15.69) where the link numbers are assumed to satisfy l1 + l2 + l3 + l4 =0, mod 2 , (15.70) for any four links meeting at a lattice site. If the temperature is high enough, then κ is small and so is tanh κ and the right hand side of Eq. (15.69) can be expanded in a power series in tanh κ. Todothis, let us note that the link numbers, lk’s, can only take values 0 or 1. Accordingly, let us postulate the graphical rule that if lk =0 for a particular link, then we will not draw a bond for the link connecting the two lattice sites whereas if lk = 1, then we will draw a bond. With this rule then, the constraint on the link numbers in Eq. (15.70) simply says that there must be an even number of bonds meeting at a given lattice site. Consequently, we note that the ﬁrst term of the expansion on the right hand side will correspond to the case where there are no bonds on the lattice giving a unit contribution (since this corresponds to the case for which all link numbers vanish). \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ 1. The next term in the series will have the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 391 15.5 High and low temperature expansions 381 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ (tanhκ)4. In other words, the ﬁrst nontrivial term in the series will correspond to the product of the weight factor tanh κ over a single plaquette. The plaquette can be drawn in n-diﬀerent ways on the lattice (recall the periodic boundary condition) and hence this term will come with a multiplicity of n. (It is clear that the constraint in Eq. (15.70) at every site would lead to closed diagrams of connected links.) The next term in the series will represent the product of the weight factor tanh κ over a plaquette involving two lattice lengths \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ (tanhκ)6. It is not hard to see that such a diagram can be drawn in 2n diﬀerent ways and hence this term will come with a multiplicity of 2n.At the next order the diagrams that will contribute are \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ (tanhκ)8, \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ (tanhκ)8, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 392 382 15 Ising model \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ (tanhκ)8, \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ (tanhκ)8. The combinatorics can be worked out in a straightforward manner for these graphs (2n+ 1 2 n(n−5)+4n+n) so that the high temperature expansion of the partition function will have the form Z(κ) (2 cosh2 κ)n =1 + n(tanh κ)4 +2n(tanh κ)6 + 1 2 n(n + 9)(tanh κ)8 + ··· . (15.71) To obtain the low temperature expansion, let us note that when T is small, κ = J kT , (15.72) is large. If T = 0, then we expect all the spins to be frozen along one axis, say up. Therefore, the low temperature expansion would merely measure the deviation from such an ordered conﬁguration. Namely, the low temperature expansion will be a measure of how many spins ﬂip as T becomes nonzero but small. Thus, dividing the partition function by e2nκ (which is the value of the partition function when all the spins are pointing along one direction), we have from Eq. (15.67) Z(κ) e2nκ = ∑ si=±1 e ( κ ∑ ⟨ij⟩(−1+sisj ) ) . (15.73) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 393 15.5 High and low temperature expansions 383 To develop the right hand side diagrammatically, let us draw a cross on the lattice site to represent a ﬂipped spin. Thus, the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq. (15.73) will correspond to a diagram without any ﬂipped spin of the form \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ 1. The next term in the series will correspond to the case where one of the spins on the lattice has ﬂipped and will represent a diagram of the form \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ e−8κ. In other words, a single ﬂipped spin will interact with each of the nearest neighbors with weight e−2κ and since there are four nearest neighbors for any site, the term would lead to a contribution of e−8κ. Furthermore, the ﬂipped spin can occur at any lattice site and hence this term will come with a multiplicity of n. The next term in the series will correspond to two ﬂipped spins. Interestingly enough, this leads to two possibilities. Namely, the ﬂipped spins can be nearest neighbors or they need not be. Dia- grammatically, the two possibilities can be represented as \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ e−12κ, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 394 384 15 Ising model \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ e−16κ. In other words, in the ﬁrst conﬁguration, the interaction between the two nearest neighbor spins which are ﬂipped does not contribute to the partition function. Furthermore, the number of ways a pair of ﬂipped spins can occur as nearest neighbors is 2n. The multiplicity of the second diagram, obviously, will be 1 2 n(n − 5) (this is because once a site with a ﬂipped spin is chosen, the four nearest neighbor sites cannot have another ﬂipped spin). However, that is not the only kind of diagram which contributes an amount e−16κ. In fact, there are other classes of diagrams which also contribute the same amount, namely, ones where there are three or four ﬂipped spins which are nearest neighbors (with multiplicities 2n,4n and n respectively) \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ e−16κ, \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ e−16κ, \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 −→ e−16κ. Thus, we can consistently derive a low temperature expansion of the partition function which has the form Z(κ) e2nκ =1 + ne−8κ +2ne−12κ + 1 2 n(n +9)e−16κ + ··· . (15.74) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 395 15.6 Quantum mechanical model 385 It is clear now that if we denote, for low temperatures, κ = κ∗ , (15.75) then, we can write the low temperature expansion also as Z(κ∗) e2nκ∗ =1 + ne−8κ∗ +2ne−12κ∗ + 1 2 n(n +9)e−16κ∗ + ··· . (15.76) Thus, comparing Eqs. (15.71) and (15.76) we see that under the mapping tanh κ = e−2κ∗ , (15.77) we have Z(κ) (2 cosh2 κ)n = Z(κ∗) e2nκ∗ . (15.78) This is, of course, the duality relation that we had derived earlier in Eq. (15.62). Here we see explicitly that the duality mapping (trans- formation) really takes us from the high temperature expansion to the low temperature expansion and vice versa. 15.6 Quantum mechanical model Before ﬁnding the correspondence between the two dimensional Ising model and a quantum mechanical model, let us derive the transfer matrix for the system. Let us begin by writing the Hamiltonian for the system in a way that is better suited for our manipulations. Let us label the sites on a given row by 1 ≤ i ≤ N and the rows by 1 ≤ m ≤ N . January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 396 386 15 Ising model \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 i m Then, we can write the interaction energy between the spins on a row m as H(m)= −J N∑ i=1 si(m)si+1(m) . (15.79) Similarly, the interaction energy between two adjacent rows, say m and (m + 1), can be written as H(m, m +1) = −J N∑ i=1 si(m)si(m +1) . (15.80) Given this, we can write (see Eq. (15.44)) the total energy of the system as H = N∑ m=1 (H(m)+ H(m, m +1)) = −J N∑ m=1 N∑ i=1 (si(m)si+1(m)+ si(m)si(m +1)) . (15.81) If we desire, we can also introduce an external magnetic ﬁeld at this point. However, let us ignore it for simplicity. The partition function will involve the exponent January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 397 15.6 Quantum mechanical model 387 e−βH = e ( −β N∑ m=1(H(m)+H(m,m+1)) ) . (15.82) Let us, for simplicity, concentrate only on a single factor of this exponent. Namely, let us look at e−β(H(m)+H(m,m+1)) = eβJ ( N∑ i=1(si(m)si+1(m)+si(m)si(m+1)) ) = N∏ i=1 eβJsi(m)si+1(m)eβJsi(m)si(m+1) . (15.83) Let us next note that on every row there are N sites and if we introduce a two component eigenvector of σ3 at every site, then we can deﬁne a 2N dimensional vector space on every row through a direct product as |s(m)⟩ = |s1(m)⟩⊗|s2(m)⟩ ⊗ ···|sN (m)⟩ = |s1,s2,...,sN ⟩ , (15.84) where si represents the eigenvalue of σ3 for the state |si(m)⟩.We can deﬁne an inner product on such states as ⟨s(m +1)|s(m)⟩ = ⟨s′ 1,s′ 2,...,s′ N |s1,s2,...,sN ⟩ = δs1s′ 1δs2s′ 2 ··· δsN s′ N . (15.85) Similarly, the completeness relation will take the form ∑ si=±1 |s(m)⟩⟨s(m)| = \u0000 , (15.86) where \u0000 denotes the 2N × 2N identity matrix. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 398 388 15 Ising model With these preliminaries, let us now introduce the following set of 2N × 2N matrices (there will be N of each) σ1(i)= \u0000 ⊗ \u0000 ⊗· · · ⊗ σ1 ⊗ \u0000 ··· ⊗ \u0000 , σ3(i)= \u0000 ⊗ \u0000 ⊗· · · ⊗ σ3 ⊗ \u0000 ··· ⊗ \u0000 . (15.87) Namely, all the entries in the above expression correspond to the trivial 2 × 2identitymatrixexceptatthe i th entry. Let us also record here the product formula for matrices deﬁned through direct products, namely, (A ⊗ B)(C ⊗ D)= AC ⊗ BD . (15.88) We note that the σ1 in the ith place acts on the vectors |si⟩ and, therefore, as a 2 × 2 matrix, we can write ⟨s′ i|αeθσ1|si⟩ = ⟨s′ i|α cosh θ + ασ1 sinh θ|si⟩ = ( α cosh θα sinh θ α sinh θα cosh θ ) , (15.89) where α is a constant. On the other hand, we note that a term such as eβJsi(m)si(m+1), (15.90) canalsobewrittenasa2 × 2 matrix of the form eβJsi(m)si(m+1) = ( eβJ e−βJ e−βJ eβJ ) . (15.91) Therefore, comparing the two relations in Eqs. (15.89) and (15.91), we note that we can identify ⟨s′ i|αeθσ1|si⟩ = eβJsi(m)si(m+1) , (15.92) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 399 15.6 Quantum mechanical model 389 provided the following relations are true, namely, α cosh θ = eβJ , α sinh θ = e−βJ . (15.93) Equivalently, we can make the above identiﬁcation provided tanh θ = e−2βJ , α =(2 sinh 2βJ) 1 2 . (15.94) Consequently, it is clear that if we deﬁne a 2N × 2N matrix as K1 = αN eθσ1(1) × eθσ1(2) ··· × eθσ1(N ) =(2 sinh 2βJ) N 2 eθ N∑ i=1 σ1(i) , (15.95) with tanh θ = e−2βJ , (15.96) then, we can write ⟨s(m +1)|K1|s(m)⟩ = eβJ ∑ i si(m)si(m+1) . (15.97) Similarly, let us also note that ⟨s(m +1)|e(˜θσ3(i+1)σ3(i))|s(m)⟩ = ⟨s(m +1)| cosh ˜θ + σ3(i +1)σ3(i)sinh ˜θ|s(m)⟩ = ⟨s(m +1)|s(m)⟩ (cosh ˜θ + si+1(m)si(m)sinh ˜θ) = ⟨s(m +1)|s(m)⟩ e˜θsi+1(m)si(m) = ⟨s(m +1)|s(m)⟩ eβJsi(m)si+1(m), (15.98) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 400 390 15 Ising model provided we make the identiﬁcation ˜θ = βJ . (15.99) Thus, deﬁning K2 = eβJ N∑ i=1 σ3(i+1)σ3(i), (15.100) we note that we can write K = K1K2 =(2 sinh 2βJ) N 2 eθ N∑ i=1 σ1(i) × eβJ N∑ i=1 σ3(i+1)σ3(i), (15.101) which deﬁnes the transfer matrix for the system. Namely, ⟨s(m +1)|K|s(m)⟩ = ⟨s(m +1)|K1K2|s(m)⟩ = ⟨s(m +1)|K1|s(m)⟩ eβJ N∑ i=1 si(m)si+1(m) = eβJ N∑ i=1 si(m)si(m+1)eβJ N∑ i=1 si(m)si+1(m) = e−β(H(m)+H(m,m+1)) . (15.102) The partition function can now be written as Z(β)= ∑ si=±1 e−βH = ∑ si=±1⟨s(1)|K|s(N )⟩⟨s(N )|K|s(N − 1)⟩···⟨s(2)|K|s(1)⟩ =Tr KN . (15.103) This, therefore, is the starting point for the Onsager solution of the two dimensional Ising model. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 401 15.6 Quantum mechanical model 391 In ﬁeld theory language, we are looking for a quantum Hamil- tonian whose Euclidean transition amplitude will yield the partition function. Furthermore, in ﬁeld theory, even if we are dealing with a theory on the lattice, we would prefer the time variable to be contin- uous. Thus, let us identify one of the axes, say the vertical one, to correspond to time and we choose the separation between the rows to be ϵ,avery smallquantity. \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 ϵ{ The continuum time limit, of course, will be obtained by choosing ϵ → 0. Let us note that we are only changing the spacing among the rows. The spacing along a row, of course, is unchanged. At ﬁrst sight, this may appear bothersome. But, let us recall that if there is a critical point in the theory, then the correlation lengths become quite large in this limit and in such a limit the lattice structure becomes quite irrelevant. Let us also note here that by making the lattice asymmetric, we have actually destroyed the isotropy of the system and, consequently, the couplings along diﬀerent axes can, in principle, be diﬀerent. Thus, allowing for diﬀerent couplings along the two axes, we can write H = N∑ m=1 N∑ i=1 (−Jsi(m)si+1(m) − J ′si(m)si(m +1)) = N∑ m=1(H(m)+ H(m, m +1)) , (15.104) where January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 402 392 15 Ising model H(m)= −J N∑ i=1 si(m)si+1(m), H(m, m +1) = −J ′ N∑ i=1 si(m)si(m +1) . (15.105) In this case, the partition function will have the form Z(β)= ∑ si=±1 e−βH = ∑ si=±1 e−β N∑ m=1(H(m)+H(m,m+1)) = ∑ si=±1 N∏ m=1 eβJ ∑ i si(m)si+1(m)+βJ ′ ∑ i si(m)si(m+1) . (15.106) In the quantum ﬁeld theory language, we write the Euclidean time interval as TEucl. = Nϵ, (15.107) and assume that there exists a quantum Hamiltonian Hq such that we can write Z(β)=Tr e−TEucl.Hq =Tr e−NϵHq = ∑ si=±1⟨s(1)|e−ϵHq |s(N )⟩···⟨s(2)|e−ϵHq |s(1)⟩ = ∑ si=±1 N∏ m=1⟨s(m +1)|e−ϵHq |s(m)⟩ . (15.108) Thus, comparing Eqs. (15.106) and (15.108), we recognize that the two can be identiﬁed if January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 403 15.7 Duality in the quantum system 393 ⟨s(m +1)|e−ϵHq |s(m)⟩ = eβ ∑ i (Jsi(m)si+1(m)+J ′si(m)si(m+1)) . (15.109) From our discussion of the transfer matrix in Eqs. (15.101) and (15.102), we immediately conclude that Hq = − ∑ i (σ1(i)+ λσ3(i +1)σ3(i)) , (15.110) where λ is a constant parameter and as before, we can identify ϵλ = βJ , tanh ϵ ≃ ϵ = e−2βJ ′ . (15.111) This relation is quite interesting in the sense that it expresses the coupling strengths as functions of the lattice spacing. In particular, we note that as we make the spacing between the rows smaller, the corresponding coupling between the rows becomes stronger. This is renormalization group behavior of the couplings in its crudest form. 15.7 Duality in the quantum system We have been able to relate the 2-d Ising model to a one dimensional quantum mechanical system with a Hamiltonian Hq = − N∑ i=1(σ1(i)+ λσ3(i +1)σ3(i)) .

(15.113) It is easy to see that μ2 1(i)=(σ3(i +1)σ3(i))2 = I, μ2 3(i)= ⎛ ⎝ i∏ j=1 σj ⎞ ⎠ 2 = I. (15.114) These results can be shown to follow from the basic commutation relations of the Pauli matrices, namely, [σ1(i),σ1(j)] = 0 = [σ3(i),σ3(j)], if i ̸= j, σ2 1(i)= \u0000 = σ2 3(i), [σ1(i),σ3(i)]+ =0 . (15.115) Using these, we can also derive that for i ̸= j, [μ1(i),μ1(j)]=[σ3(i +1)σ3(i),σ3(j +1)σ3(j)] = 0, [μ3(i),μ3(j)] = [ i∏ k=1 σ1(k), j∏ l=1 σ1(l) ] =0 . (15.116) On the other hand, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 405 15.7 Duality in the quantum system 395 [μ1(i),μ3(i)]+ = ⎡ ⎣σ3(i +1)σ3(i), i∏ j=1 σ1(j) ⎤ ⎦ + = σ3(i +1) i−1∏ j=1[σ3(i),σ1(i)]+σ1(j) =0 . (15.117) Thus, μ1(i)and μ3(i) also have the same algebraic properties as the Pauli matrices on the original lattice. Furthermore, let us note that by deﬁnition, μ3(i +1)μ3(i)= σ1(i +1) . (15.118) Using these, then, we note that we can write Hq(λ)= − N∑ i=1(σ1(i)+ λσ3(i +1)σ3(i)) = − N∑ i=1(μ3(i +1)μ3(i)+ λμ1(i)) = −λ N∑ i=1 (μ1(i)+ λ−1μ3(i +1)μ3(i)) = λHq(λ−1) . (15.119) This is the self duality relation for this system. Namely, it maps the strong coupling properties of the system to its weak coupling properties. This shows, in particular, that the energy eigenvalues of this system must also satisfy the relation E(λ)= λE(λ−1) . (15.120) For some ﬁnite value of λ, if there is a phase transition such that the correlation lengths become inﬁnite or that some energy eigenvalue January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 406 396 15 Ising model becomes zero (zero mode), then the above duality relation implies that this must happen at λ = 1. This is precisely how we had deter- mined the critical temperature for the 2-d Ising model in Eq. (15.66). Let us also note here that since we have a quantum mechanical de- scription of the 2-d Ising model, we can also develop a perturbation theory in the standard manner. 15.8 References K.

Schwinger used this observation and developed the idea fully to what is now known as the proper time method or the proper time formal- ism. This is quite useful in studying many properties of quantum ﬁeld theories, in particular, gauge theories since it, equivalently, in- troduces a gauge invariant regularization. It can be used at zero temperatureaswellasatﬁnite temperature. Thepropertimefor- malism was the precursor of the zeta function regularization and the heat kernel method which we will discuss in the next chapter. These latter methods are quite useful in the covariant study of quantum ﬁeld theories on nontrivial backgrounds (with or without boundaries) as well as in the study of Casimir energy. 16.1 Scalar propagator in D dimensions To introduce the idea of the proper time method, let us consider a free, massive scalar ﬁeld theory in D (ﬂat) space-time dimensions described by a Lagrangian density L = 1 2 ∂μφ(x)∂μφ(x) − m2 2 φ2(x)= 1 2 φ(x) ˆHφ(x), (16.1) where x denotes the coordinates in D space-time dimensions, m rep- resents the mass of the ﬁeld (particles) and we have identiﬁed (after an integration by parts) ˆH = −(□ + m2), □ = ημν∂μ∂ν. (16.2) 397 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 408 398 16 Proper time formalism Here ημν denotes the Minkowski metric in D dimensions. (We par- enthetically note here that the operator in the quadratic terms of the Lagrangian density is generally denoted by ˆO. However, we have denoted the operator here as ˆH for reasons to become clear shortly.) The tree level Green’s function (propagator), for the massive scalar ﬁeld, satisﬁes the equation (see, for example, Eq. (3.75) in one di- mension) (□ + m2)G(x − x′)= −δD(x − x′). (16.3) Here G(x − x′) denotes the Green’s function of the theory (the prop- agator is given by iG(x − x′)) and can be evaluated in the following way. (There are various ways of determining the Green’s function. The present method introduces the proper time method which is use- ful in various other studies in quantum ﬁeld theory.) Equation (16.3) can be written in the operator form as (\u0000 denotes the identity oper- ator in D dimensions) (□ + m 2) ˆG = −\u0000 , ⟨x| ˆG|x′⟩ = G(x − x′), (16.4) so that we have (see Eq. (16.2)) ˆG = 1 ˆH = lim ϵ→0+ −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτeiτ ( ˆH+iϵ) = lim ϵ→0+ −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτeiτ (−(□+m2)+iϵ) = lim ϵ→0+ −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτeiτ (ˆpμ ˆpμ−m2+iϵ) = lim ϵ→0+ −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτe−ϵτ eiτ (ˆp2−m2), (16.5) wherewehaveidentiﬁed (ℏ =1) ˆpμ = i∂μ, [ˆxμ, ˆpν]= −iδμ ν \u0000 , ˆp2 =ˆpμ ˆpμ. (16.6) We note here that τ in Eq. (16.5) is an auxiliary variable, commonly known as the proper time for reasons to be clear shortly. The “iϵ” January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 409 16.1 Scalar propagator in D dimensions 399 prescription (which leads to the Feynman prescription for the Green’s function) is needed for convergence of the integral at the upper limit. (We point out here that sometimes the proper time is also denoted by s, but we use τ for closer analogy with (proper) time.) Let |x⟩ denote the eigenstates of the coordinate operator in the Schr¨odinger picture, namely, ˆxμ|x⟩ = xμ|x⟩, ⟨x|ˆxμ = xμ⟨x|, (16.7) and let us deﬁne new (time translated) coordinate states |x, τ ⟩ = e−iτ ˆH |x⟩ = e−iτ ˆH |x, 0⟩, ⟨x, τ | = ⟨x|eiτ ˆH = ⟨x, 0|eiτ ˆH , (16.8) wherewehaveused thefactthat ˆH in Eq. (16.2) is Hermitian and we have identiﬁed |x⟩ = |x, 0⟩. These coordinate states are eigenstates of the coordinate operator ˆxμ(τ )= e−iτ ˆH ˆxμeiτ ˆH , ˆxμ(0) = ˆxμ, (16.9) so that ˆxμ(τ )|x, τ ⟩ = e−iτ ˆH ˆxμeiτ ˆH e−iτ ˆH |x⟩ = xμe−iτ ˆH |x⟩ = xμ|x, τ ⟩, ⟨x, τ |ˆxμ(τ )= ⟨x|eiτ ˆH e−iτ ˆH ˆxμeiτ ˆH = xμ⟨x|eiτ ˆH = xμ⟨x, τ |, (16.10) where we have used Eq. (16.7). Similarly, we have (see also Eq. (16.6)) ˆpμ(τ )= e−iτ ˆH ˆpμeiτ ˆH , [ˆxμ(τ ), ˆpν(τ )] = −iδμ ν \u0000 . (16.11) Equations (16.9) and (16.11) lead to the (diﬀerential) time evo- lution equations for the operators as (this is the reason why we have January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 410 400 16 Proper time formalism denoted the quadratic operator as ˆH, namely, it corresponds to the Hamiltonian for proper time evolution of the system) dˆpμ(τ ) dτ = i[ˆpμ(τ ), ˆH]= i[ˆpμ(τ ), ˆp2 − m 2]=0, dˆxμ(τ ) dτ = i[ˆxμ(τ ), ˆp2 − m 2]= i(−2iˆpμ(τ )) = 2ˆpμ(τ ), (16.12) where we have used the commutation relations from Eqs. (16.6) and (16.11). These equations can be easily solved to yield ˆpμ(τ )= ˆpμ(0) = ˆpμ, ˆxμ(τ )= ˆxμ(0) + 2ˆpμτ =ˆxμ +2ˆpμτ, (16.13) leading to ˆpμ = ˆxμ(τ ) − ˆxμ(0) 2τ = ˆxμ(τ ) − ˆxμ 2τ . (16.14) As a result, we obtain ˆH =ˆpμ ˆpμ − m2 = 1 4τ 2 (ˆxμ(τ ) − ˆxμ)(ˆxμ(τ ) − ˆxμ) − m2 = 1 4τ 2 (ˆxμ(τ )ˆxμ(τ ) − 2ˆxμ(τ )ˆxμ +ˆxμ ˆxμ +2iDτ ) − m2, (16.15) where D denotes the number of space-time dimensions and we have used Eq. (16.13) in the intermediate step, namely, (see Eq. (16.6) and the identity operator, \u0000 , is understood here) [ˆxμ, ˆxν(τ )] = [ˆxμ, ˆxν +2ˆpντ ]= −2iημντ. (16.16) From the deﬁnition in Eq. (16.4), we see that we can write the Green’s function as (see also Eq. (16.5)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 411 16.1 Scalar propagator in D dimensions 401 G(x − x′)= ⟨x| ˆG|x′⟩ = −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτe−ϵτ ⟨x|ei ˆHτ |x′⟩ = −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτe−ϵτ ⟨x|ei ˆHτ |x′⟩ = −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτe−ϵτ ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩, (16.17) where the limit ϵ → 0 is understood and we have used the identiﬁ- cation in Eqs. (16.8). We note that the transition amplitude ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = ⟨x, 0|ei ˆHτ |x′, 0⟩ = ⟨x|ei ˆHτ |x′⟩, (16.18) represents the probability that an initial coordinate state |x′⟩ = |x′, 0⟩ would propagate to the state |x, τ ⟩ in a given (proper) time τ . This transition amplitude plays an important role in the proper time method as well as in the heat kernel method (to be discussed in the next chapter). It follows from Eq. (16.18) that ∂τ ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = i⟨x|ei ˆHτ ˆH|x′⟩ = i⟨x, τ | ˆH|x′, 0⟩ = ( i 4τ 2 (x − x′)2 − D 2τ − im2) ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩. (16.19) Here we have used the form of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (16.15) as well as the eigenstate conditions in Eqs. (16.7) and (16.10). Equa- tion (16.19) can be trivially integrated to determine ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = C τ D 2 e− i 4τ (x−x′)2−im2τ , (16.20) where C is a constant determined from the initial (normalization) condition ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ τ →0 −−−→⟨x|x′⟩ = δD(x − x′). (16.21) There are various ways of determining the constant C.We discuss only two (equivalent) methods to bring out some subtleties. We recall that the integral of the one dimensional Gaussian January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 412 402 16 Proper time formalism ∫ ∞ −∞ dxe−αx2 = √ π α ,α > 0, (16.22) leads to the well known Gaussian representation for the Dirac delta function as (area under the delta function has to be unity) √ α π e−αx2 α→∞ −−−→ δ(x). (16.23) The integral in Eq. (16.22) can be easily generalized to the D-dimensional Euclidean space as ∫ ∞ −∞ dDxe−αx·x = ( π α ) D 2 ,α > 0, (16.24) similarly leading to ( α π ) D 2 e−αx·x α→∞ −−−→ δD(x). (16.25) On the other hand, for an oscillatory Gaussian in one dimension of the form e±iαx2,α > 0, the normalization can be obtained in one of two ways as follows. First, we can rotate to “Euclidean space” (for either of the signs in the exponent) as x → √±i ¯x, (16.26) leading to ∫ ∞ −∞ dxe±iαx2 → ∫ ∞ −∞ √±id¯xe±iα(±i¯x2) = √±i ∫ ∞ −∞ d¯xe−α¯x2 = √ ±iπ α . (16.27) This leads to a representation of the one dimensional Dirac delta function in terms of the one dimensional oscillatory Gaussian of the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 413 16.1 Scalar propagator in D dimensions 403 √ ∓iα π e±iαx2 α→∞ −−−→ δ(x). (16.28) Equation (16.27) (and, therefore, Eq. (16.28)) can also be obtained in an alternative manner by introducing a regularization parameter. Namely, we note that we can write (ϵ is a regularization parameter diﬀerent from the one introduced earlier) ∫ dxe±iαx2 = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ dxe−(ϵ∓iα)x2 = lim ϵ→0 √ π ϵ ∓ iα = √ ±iπ α , (16.29) which coincides with Eq. (16.27). This can be generalized to D- dimensional Euclidean space to give ( ∓iα π ) D 2 e±iαx·x α→∞ −−−→ δD(x). (16.30) In a D-dimensional Minkowski space, the invariant length of the form x2 =(x0)2 − (x1)2 − ··· − (xD−1)2, (16.31) on the other hand, has one positive signature and D − 1 negative signatures coming from the structure of the metric. Correspond- ingly, using Eq. (16.27) (or Eq. (16.28)), we conclude that in such a case (we restrict to the negative exponent here which coincides with Eq. (16.20)), ( iα π ) 1 2 ( −iα π ) D−1 2 e−iαx2 =(−i) D 2 −1 ( α π ) D 2 e−iαx2 α→∞ −−−→ δD(x). (16.32) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 414 404 16 Proper time formalism We can now compare Eqs. (16.20) and (16.21) with Eq. (16.32) (with α = 1 4τ ) which determines ( 1 τ D 2 has already been factored out in Eq. (16.20)) C = (−i) D 2 −1 (4π) D 2 . (16.33) As a result, we can write the transition amplitude as (see Eq. (16.20)) ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = (−i) D 2 −1 (4πτ ) D 2 e− i 4τ (x−x′)2−i(m2−iϵ)τ . (16.34) This allows us to write the scalar Green’s function in D-dimensions as (see Eq. (16.17)) G(x − x′) = lim ϵ→0+ −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτe−ϵτ ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = lim ϵ→0+ ( −i 4π ) D 2 ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ D 2 e− i 4τ ((x−x′)2−iϵ)−i(m2−iϵ)τ . (16.35) We note here that we have introduced a regularization parameter for the integral to be convergent at the lower limit τ = 0 in addition to the one that was already there to make the integral well behaved at the upper limit. In principle, the new parameter can be distinct, however, we have chosen them to be the same for simplicity. The integral in Eq. (16.35) can be done with the help of the tables (see, for example, Gradshteyn and Ryzhik 3.471.9) and leads to G(x − x′) = lim ϵ→0+ ( −i 2π ) D 2 ( m2 − iϵ (x − x′)2 − iϵ ) D−2 4 × K D 2 −1(i√(m2 − iϵ)((x − x′)2 − iϵ)), (16.36) where we have used the property of the modiﬁed Bessel function, K−ν = Kν. This is the massive scalar propagator in D space-time dimensions. We can obtain the massless limit of Eq. (16.36) using the Bessel function identity January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 415 16.2 Evaluating determinants 405 Kν(z) z→0 −−−→ 1 2 Γ(ν) ( z 2 )−ν , (16.37) which leads to the massless Green’s function (in D dimensions) of the form G(x − x′) = lim ϵ→0+ (−i)D−1 4π D 2 Γ( D 2 − 1) ((x − x′)2 − iϵ) D 2 −1 . (16.38) In particular, for D = 4, this leads to the well known coordinate space result G(x − x′) = lim ϵ→0+ i 4π2 1 (x − x′)2 − iϵ , (16.39) while, for D =3, we have G(x − x′) = lim ϵ→0+ − 1 4π 1 √ (x − x′)2 − iϵ . (16.40) Both of these results can be readily checked with the Fourier trans- forms of the corresponding momentum space Feynman Green’s func- tions. 16.2 Evaluating determinants Determinants arise quite regularly in quantum theories, as we have seen earlier. For example, if we have a quadratic Lagrangian den- sity, as in Eq. (16.1), and we integrate out the ﬁeld variables in the path integral formalism, then it leads to the determinant (det ˆH)− 1 2 (see, for example, Eq. (4.3)) which is a constant. If the quantum me- chanical system is in equilibrium at a ﬁnite temperature, then this determinant is a temperature dependent quantity (constant for a given temperature) leading to the partition function (free energy) of the theory. When we have a quantum ﬁeld theory which is quadratic in the basic ﬁeld variables, but is interacting with an external ﬁeld nontrivially, then integrating out the basic ﬁeld variables leads to January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 416 406 16 Proper time formalism a determinant which is a functional of the external ﬁelds. Such a determinant leads naturally to an eﬀective action for the external ﬁeld. We will talk about determining the eﬀective action in the proper time formalism in the next section. Here we indicate how the proper time formalism can be used to calculate the partition functions of various quantum mechanical systems. 16.2.1 Bosonic oscillator Let us consider a bosonic oscillator which is a 0+1 dimensional quan- tum ﬁeld theory and which we have studied in detail in Chapters 3 and 4 (we have also calculated the partition function for the oscil- lator in Chapter 14). The partition function is best studied in the imaginary time (Euclidean space) (see, for example, Eqs. (4.8) and (14.40)) where the Lagrangian for the oscillator has the form (see Eq. (4.9) with ℏ =1= m) L = 1 2 (( dx dt )2 − ω2x2) = − 1 2 x ( d2 dt2 + ω2) x →− 1 2 x (− d2 dt2 + ω2) x = −LE, (16.41) where ω denotes the natural frequency of the oscillator. (Here we have neglected a total derivative term, rotated to imaginary time t →−it and do not use τ to denote the imaginary time as in Eq. (4.8) sinceweare using τ for the proper time in this chapter. Therefore, t in the following is really the imaginary time.) Integrating out the ﬁeld variable x(t) in the path integral leads to the partition function for the bosonic oscillator Z(β)= [det (− d2 dt2 + ω2)]− 1 2 =exp {− 1 2 Tr ln (− d2 dt2 + ω2)} , (16.42) where β = 1 kT with k denoting the Boltzmann constant (see Eq. (14.6)) and “Tr” stands for the trace to be taken in any complete basis (remember also that det A = eTr ln A). The determinant has to be January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 417 16.2 Evaluating determinants 407 evaluated in the space of periodic functions with a time interval β (partition function involves a trace, see Eq. (14.5)). We point out here that Eq. (16.42) incorporates two results derived earlier. Namely, the generating functional for an action quadratic in the dy- namical variables is proportional to the determinant of the quadratic operator in the action (see Eq. (4.19)) as well as the fact that the par- tition function is the generating functional of the system evaluated on the periodic space with the end points identiﬁed and integrated (see Eq. (14.47)). We recall from the deﬁnition of the Gamma function (s is as- sumed to be a real parameter) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 e−ατ = α−s Γ(s),α > 0,s > 0, (16.43) that, in the limit s → 0, the right hand side of Eq. (16.43) leads to lim s→0 α−sΓ(s) = lim s→0 (1 − s ln α + O(s2)) ( 1 s + O(s0)) = C − ln α, (16.44) where C is an uninteresting divergent constant. Therefore, up to an uninteresting, additive constant, we can write ln α = − ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ e−ατ , (16.45) which can also be generalized to any positive operator as ln ˆH = − ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ e−τ ˆH . (16.46) Therefore, we can write Tr ln ˆH = − ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ Tr e−τ ˆH , (16.47) where the “trace” can be evaluated in any basis. In particular, in the coordinate basis, we can write January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 418 408 16 Proper time formalism Tr e−τ ˆH = ∫ dt ⟨t|e−τ ˆH |t⟩, (16.48) where the limits of integration depend on the particular problem being studied (for example, zero temperature or ﬁnite temperature). To determine the partition function in Eq. (16.42), let us iden- tify ˆH = (− d2 dt2 + ω2) =(ˆp2 + ω2), (16.49) with (see Eq. (16.6)) ˆp = i d dt , [ˆt, ˆp]= −i, (16.50) Furthermore, we deﬁne as before (see Eq. (16.8) with τ → iτ ) |t, τ ⟩ = eτ ˆH |t, 0⟩ = eτ ˆH |t⟩, ⟨t, τ | = ⟨t, 0|e−τ ˆH = ⟨t|e−τ ˆH , (16.51) where ˆt|t⟩ = t|t⟩. This allows us to write (see Eqs. (16.9), (16.11) and (16.12)) ˆt(τ )= eτ ˆH ˆte−τ ˆH , ˆp(τ )= eτ ˆH ˆpe−τ ˆH , [ˆt(τ ), ˆp(τ )] = −i, (16.52) with ˆt(0) = ˆt,ˆp(0) = ˆp and it follows that ˆt(τ )|t, τ ⟩ = t|t, τ ⟩, ⟨t, τ |ˆt(τ )= t ⟨t, τ |. (16.53) Therefore, we can write ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = ⟨t|e−τ ˆH |t′⟩,∂τ ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = −⟨t, τ | ˆH|t′, 0⟩. (16.54) As before, the transition amplitude can be determined by solv- ing the time evolution equations (see Eq. (16.52)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 419 16.2 Evaluating determinants 409 dˆp(τ ) dτ = −[ˆp(τ ), ˆH]= −[ˆp(τ ), ˆp2 + ω2]=0, dˆt(τ ) dτ = −[ˆt(τ ), ˆH]= −[ˆt(τ ), ˆp 2 + ω2]=2iˆp(τ )=2iˆp, (16.55) which lead to ˆp(τ )= ˆp, ˆt(τ )= ˆt +2iˆpτ. (16.56) This, in turn, determines ˆp = ˆt(τ ) − ˆt 2iτ , [ˆt, ˆt(τ )] = 2τ. (16.57) Using these, as discussed in the last section, we now obtain ˆH = (ˆt(τ ) − ˆt )2 −4τ 2 + ω2 = − 1 4τ 2 ((ˆt(τ ))2 − 2ˆt(τ )ˆt +(ˆt )2 − 2τ )+ ω2. (16.58) Substituting this into Eq. (16.54) we obtain ∂τ ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = [ 1 4τ 2 (t − t ′)2 − 1 2τ − ω2] ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩, (16.59) which can be integrated to give (together with a normalizing constant discussed in the last section) ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = K(t − t′,τ )= 1 √4πτ e− (t−t′)2 4τ −ω2τ . (16.60) This can be compared with Eq. (16.34) for D = 1 andwithappro- priate analytic continuation of τ (namely, τ → iτ ) as can be seen from Eq. (16.51) as well as m2 →−ω2. The transition amplitude in Eq. (16.60) has been derived with- out any reference to the periodicity condition that we need at ﬁnite January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 420 410 16 Proper time formalism temperature. A periodic ﬁnite temperature transition amplitude can be obtained from Eq. (16.60) through the linear superposition ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩(β) = K(β)(t − t ′,τ )= ∞∑ n=−∞ K(t − t′ − nβ, τ ) = K(β)(t − t ′ − β, τ ). (16.61) Therefore, on the space of periodic functions, we can write (see Eq. (16.48)) Tr ln ˆH = − ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ Tr e−τ ˆH = − ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ ∫ β 0 dt ⟨t|e−τ ˆH |t⟩(β) = − ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ ∫ β 0 dt ⟨t, τ |t, 0⟩(β) = − ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ ∫ β 0 dt ∞∑ n=−∞ K(−nβ, τ ) = −β ∞∑ n=−∞ ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ K(−nβ, τ ), (16.62) where the integral over t is trivial (since there is no t dependence in the integrand) and we have also interchanged the summation and integration in the last step. Using the form of K from Eq. (16.60), we have Tr ln ˆH = − β √4π ∞∑ n=−∞ ∫ ∞ 0 dττ − 3 2 e− n2β2 4τ −ω2τ = − 2β √4π ∞∑ n=1 ∫ ∞ 0 dττ − 3 2 e− n2β2 4τ −ω2τ − β √4π ∫ ∞ 0 dττ − 3 2 e−ω2τ . (16.63) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 421 16.2 Evaluating determinants 411 The ﬁrst of these integrals gives the modiﬁed Bessel function (see, for example, Gradshteyn and Ryzhik 3.471.9) while the second is a Gamma function leading to Tr ln ˆH = − 2β √4π ∞∑ n=1 2 ( nβ 2ω )− 1 2 K 1 2 (nβω) − β √4π ωΓ (− 1 2 ) = −2 ∞∑ n=1 1 n e−nβω + βω. (16.64) Here we have used the particular form of K 1 2 (z) as well as the prop- erties of the Gamma function. The sum in the ﬁrst term in Eq. (16.64) can be evaluated in a simple manner as follows. ∞∑ n=1 1 n e−nβω = ∞∑ n=1 ∫ ∞ βω dze−nz = ∫ ∞ βω dz ∞∑ n=1 e−nz = ∫ ∞ βω dz e−z 1 − e−z =ln(1 − e−z)∣ ∣∞ βω = − ln(1 − e−βω)= − ln (2sinh βω 2 ) + βω 2 . (16.65) Substituting this result into Eq. (16.64), we obtain Tr ln ˆH =2 ln (2sinh βω 2 ) . (16.66) The partition function now follows from Eq. (16.42) to have the form Z(β)= e− 1 2 Tr ln ˆH = (2sinh βω 2 )−1 = 1 2sinh βω 2 , (16.67) which is the well known partition function for the bosonic oscillator (also derived in Eqs. (14.35) and (14.41) in diﬀerent ways). January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 422 412 16 Proper time formalism 16.2.2 Fermionic oscillator The fermionic oscillator, as we have seen in Chapter 5,is a ﬁrst order system which is described by the Euclidean Lagrangian (see Eq. (5.45)) LE = ¯ψ ( d dt + ω) ψ, ω > 0, (16.68) where t denotes the imaginary (Euclidean) time. If we naively iden- tify the operator in the quadratic term to be ˆH = d dt + ω, (16.69) then, we will conclude that the partition function is given by (we have a fermionic system so that the power of the determinant is positive and there are two degrees of freedom making the power unity) ZF (β)=det ( d dt + ω) = eTr ln( d dt +ω). (16.70) This would lead to proper time evolution equations (see, for example, Eq. (16.55)) with the solutions p(τ )= p(0) = p, t(τ )= t(0) + τ, (16.71) which do not allow us to express p in terms of t. As a result, the evaluation of the transition amplitude becomes diﬃcult. Therefore, we will try another method to evaluate the determinant (partition function). As we have emphasized in Chapter 5, a fermionic (Grassmann) system is inherently a matrix system and we can combine the two dynamical variables into the two component matrices (see Eq. (5.61)) Ψ= (ψ ¯ψ ) , ¯Ψ=Ψ†σ3 = ( ¯ψ −ψ) . (16.72) Here σ3 denotes the diagonal Pauli matrix. With this, the Hermitian Lagrangian Eq. (5.44) (see also Eq. (5.53)) rotates to imaginary time as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 423 16.2 Evaluating determinants 413 LE = 1 2 ¯Ψ (σ3 d dt + ω) Ψ, (16.73) which can also be seen from Eq. (5.64) (with the source Θ = 0). As a result, the operator in the quadratic terms can be identiﬁed with the matrix operator ˆH = σ3 d dt + ω. (16.74) Correspondingly, the partition function can be written as (the system has a single fermionic matrix degree of freedom, but the quadratic operator is a 2 × 2 matrix) Z(β)= [det (σ3 d dt + ω)] 1 2 = [det (− d2 dt2 + ω2)] 1 2 = e 1 2 Tr ln(− d2 dt2 +ω2). (16.75) Here we have used the fact that the determinant involves both a coordinate part as well as a matrix part and the matrix part of the determinant is trivial since the two matrices (σ3 and \u0000 ) are diagonal. What remains, therefore, is only a determinant over any complete basis states (such as coordinate states). There are several things to note from Eq. (16.75). First, the operator in the exponent is what we had dealt with earlier in the bosonic oscillator case (see Eq. (16.49)) so that the analysis of proper time evolution and the determination of the transition amplitude can be carried over completely from Eqs. (16.49)–(16.60). There is a sign diﬀerence in the exponent in Eq. (16.75) (compared with Eq. (16.42)) which results from the fermionic nature of the system and should be kept in mind. Most importantly, we should remember that at ﬁnite temperature fermions obey anti-periodicity conditions (see Eq. (14.50)) so that the determinant (and, therefore, the tran- sition amplitude) in this case has to be evaluated over anti-periodic functions. We can determine the transition amplitude over the space of anti-periodic functions as (compare with Eq. (16.61)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 424 414 16 Proper time formalism ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩(β) = ¯K(β)(t − t ′,τ )= ∞∑ n=−∞(−1)nK(t − t ′ − nβ, τ ) = − ¯K(β)(t − t′ − β, τ ), (16.76) where K(t − t′,τ ) is already determined in Eq. (16.60). There- fore, in the space of anti-periodic functions, we have (compare with Eqs. (16.62) and (16.63)) Tr ln (− d2 dt2 + ω2) = −β ∞∑ n=−∞(−1)n ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ K(−nβ, τ ) = − 2β √4π ∞∑ n=1(−1)n ∫ ∞ 0 dττ − 3 2 e− n2β2 4τ −ω2τ − β √4π ∫ ∞ 0 dττ − 3 2 e−ω2τ . (16.77) The τ integral can be evaluated as in Eq. (16.64) and leads to Tr ln (− d2 dt2 + ω2) =2 ∞∑ n=1 (−1)n+1 n e−nβω + βω. (16.78) As in Eq. (16.65), we can write ∞∑ n=1 (−1)n+1 n e−nβω = ∞∑ n=1(−1)n+1 ∫ ∞ βω dze−nz = ∫ ∞ βω dz ∞∑ n=1(−1)n+1e−nz = ∫ ∞ βω dz e−z 1+ e−z = − ln(1 + e−z)∣ ∣∞ βω =ln (2 cosh βω 2 ) − βω 2 . (16.79) Substituting this back into Eq. (16.78), we obtain Tr ln (− d2 dt2 + ω2) =2 ln (2 cosh βω 2 ) , (16.80) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 425 16.3 Effective actions 415 so that the partition function (see Eq. (16.75)) can be determined to have the form Z(β)= e 1 2 Tr ln(− d2 dt2 +ω2) =2 cosh βω 2 , (16.81) which coincides with Eqs. (14.57) and (14.59). 16.3 Eﬀective actions In the last section, we evaluated the partition functions (determi- nants with periodicity) for two simple systems, namely, the bosonic and the fermionic oscillator. The Lagrangians for these two systems were quadratic in the dynamical variables with a constant quadratic operator which is why they could be exactly evaluated. However, when a dynamical system, say, a fermion, is interacting with a space- time dependent external ﬁeld (say, an external gauge ﬁeld), even though the system is quadratic in the dynamical variables, the de- terminant becomes a functional of the external ﬁeld and leads to an eﬀective action for the external ﬁeld. We may or may not be able to determine the determinant (and, therefore, the eﬀective action) exactly in a closed form in such a case. When we cannot evaluate it exactly, we resort to a perturbative determinantion of the eﬀective action. In this section, we explain this idea (within the context of proper time formalism) with two examples at zero temperature and one example at ﬁnite temperature. First, let us recall some deﬁnitions. The Lagrangian density for a fermion interacting with an external gauge ﬁeld in an arbitrary dimension is given by L = ¯ψ(γμ(i∂μ − Aμ(x)) − m)ψ, μ =0, 1, 2, ··· ,D − 1, (16.82) where D> 1 denotes the number of space-time dimensions and we have set the coupling constant to unity for simplicity. (We will treat the 0 + 1 dimensional case separately in the following.) This La- grangian density is quadratic in the dynamical ﬁeld variables and, therefore, the generating functional can be formally determined to be (ℏ =1) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 426 416 16 Proper time formalism Z[A]= eiW [A] = N [det(i∂/ − m − A/)], (16.83) where N is a normalization constant (normally divergent beyond 0 + 1 dimension). This determines the generating functional for the connected Green’s functions (or the eﬀective action) to be W [A]= −i ln Z[A]= −i ln[N det(i∂/ − m − A/)]. (16.84) Subtracting out the value at Aμ = 0, we obtain the normalized ef- fective action to be Γ[A]= W [A] − W [A =0]= −i ln [det(i∂/ − m − A/)] [det(i∂/ − m)] = −i ln det (\u0000 − S(i∂/)A/) = −iTr ln (\u0000 − S(i∂/)A/) , (16.85) where S(i∂/)=(i∂/ − m)−1 is the free fermion Green’s function oper- ator with momentum vector replaced by i∂μ. Clearly, this eﬀective action is normalized so as to vanish when the external source is set to zero, namely, Γ[A = 0] = 0. At this point, we can Taylor expand the logarithm and evaluate the trace using the coordinate basis. This wouldleadtothe oneloopeﬀectiveactioninthe usualperturbation theory. However, we will describe how to evaluate the eﬀective action through the use of the proper time formalism. Using Eq. (16.46), we can give an integral representation to Γ[A] Γ[A]= i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ Tr e−τ (\u0000 −S(i∂/)A/) = i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ e−τ Tr e−τ ˆH , (16.86) wherewehaveused theidentity e−τ \u0000 = e−τ \u0000 . January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 427 16.3 Effective actions 417 Furthermore, we have denoted ˆH = −S(i∂/)A/ = −S(ˆp/)A/(ˆx), (16.87) wherewehaveidentiﬁed, asinEq. (16.6), ˆpμ = i∂μ and the free (operator) Green’s function for a massive fermion (in D dimensions) has the form S(ˆp/)=(ˆp/ − m)−1 = ˆp/ + m ˆp2 − m2 . (16.88) The Feynman prescription is understood here although we do not write it explicitly for simplicity. Choosing the trace (trace has two parts, a matrix trace and a coordinate trace) to be evaluated in the coordinate basis states we can write Γ[A]= i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ e−τ ∫ dDx tr ⟨x|e−τ ˆH |x⟩, (16.89) where “tr” stands for trace over Dirac (or other) matrix indices. This one loop eﬀective action is regularized in a gauge invariant manner through the use of the proper time method (regularization). Unlike the other cases which we have studied earlier, ˆH now contains both coordinates and momenta (in a mixed manner). As a result, the proper time Hamiltonian equations (see, for example, Eq. (16.12) or (16.55)) can not be solved in a simple manner. There- fore, we try to solve the (proper) time evolution equation for the transition amplitude directly (see, for example, Eq. (16.54) for 0 + 1 dimension and the discussions in that section), namely, ∂τ ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = −⟨x, τ | ˆH|x′, 0⟩ = ⟨x, τ |S(ˆp/)A/(ˆx)|x′, 0⟩, (16.90) where we have used the identiﬁcation in Eq. (16.87). If this equa- tion will have a closed form solution, there will be a corresponding exact (closed form) eﬀective action. If not, then the solution of this equation will lead to a perturbative solution for the eﬀective action (which, of course, completely agrees with the form obtained from a perturbative diagrammatic calculation). We will now illustrate how this method leads to exact eﬀective actions in two cases at zero tem- perature. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 428 418 16 Proper time formalism 16.3.1 Zero temperature To start with, let us analyze the 0 + 1 dimensional fermion interact- ing with an external electromagnetic ﬁeld through minimal coupling (coupling constant set to unity). The minimally coupled Lagrangian has the form (see also Eq. (16.68) and remember that e =1) L = ¯ψ((i∂t − A(t)) − m)ψ, m > 0, (16.91) where ψ and ¯ψ are two fermion ﬁelds. Here the external gauge ﬁeld A(t) is an arbitrary function of t. This system can be described also as a two component matrix system as in Eq. (16.72) and would lead to equivalent results, but we will continue with Eq. (16.91) for simplicity. Following Eqs. (16.85) and (16.86), we can write Γ[A]= −i ln det(i∂t − m − A) det(i∂t − m) = −i ln det(1 − S(i∂t)A(t)) = −i Tr ln(1 − S(i∂t)A(t)) = i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ e−τ Tr eτS(i∂t)A(t) = i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ e−τ Tr e−τ ˆH , (16.92) wherewehaveidentiﬁed ˆH = −S(i∂t)A(ˆt )= −S(ˆp)A(ˆt ), (16.93) with the identiﬁcation, as in Eq. (16.6), ˆp = i∂t. The free Green’s function, in this case, is given by S(ˆp)=(ˆp − m)−1 = 1 ˆp − m + iϵ . (16.94) In this case, Eq. (16.90) takes the form January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 429 16.3 Effective actions 419 ∂τ ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = −⟨t, τ | ˆH|t′, 0⟩ = ⟨t, τ |S(ˆp)A(ˆt )|t ′, 0⟩ = ⟨t, τ |S(ˆp)|t′, 0⟩A(t′). (16.95) For later use, let us calculate the matrix element ⟨t, 0|S(ˆp)|t′, 0⟩ = ∫ dp ⟨t, 0|p⟩⟨p|S(ˆp)|t ′, 0⟩ = ∫ dp 1 p − m + iϵ ⟨t, 0|p⟩⟨p|t ′, 0⟩ = ∫ dp 2π 1 p − m + iϵ e−ip(t−t′) = −iθ(t − t′) e−im(t−t′). (16.96) Namely, we see that in 0+1 dimension, the Feynman Green’s function coincides with the retarded Green’s function. This can be understood simply from the fact that, in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, time only ﬂows forward. Using this as well as introducing a complete set of coordinate states, we can write Eq. (16.95) as ∂τ ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = ∫ dt1 ⟨t, τ |t1, 0⟩⟨t1, 0|S(ˆp)|t′, 0⟩A(t′) = −i ∫ dt1 ⟨t, τ |t1, 0⟩θ(t1 − t′)A(t′)e−im(t1−t′). (16.97) This equation can be formally integrated leading to ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = δ(t − t′) − i ∫ τ 0 dτ ′ ∫ dt1 ⟨t, τ ′|t1, 0⟩θ(t1 − t′)A(t′)e−im(t1−t′). (16.98) Here the homogeneous term on the right hand side is needed to ensure the normalization condition (see Eq. (16.21)) ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ τ →0 −−−→ δ(t − t′). January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 430 420 16 Proper time formalism The integral equation in Eq. (16.98) can be solved iteratively and may not have a closed form in general. However, in the present case it does have a closed form expression which can be seen as follows ⟨t, τ |t′, 0⟩ = δ(t − t′) − i ∫ τ 0 dτ ′θ(t − t′)A(t′)e−im(t−t′) +(−i)2 ∫ τ 0 dτ ′ ∫ τ ′ 0 dτ ′′ ∫ dt1 × θ(t − t1)θ(t1 − t′)A(t1)A(t′)e−im(t−t′) + ··· = δ(t − t′) − iτ θ(t − t′)A(t′)e−im(t−t′) + (−iτ )2 2 ∫ dt1θ(t − t1)θ(t1 − t′)A(t1)A(t′)e−im(t−t′) + ··· . (16.99) In taking the trace (see Eq. (16.92)), we have to identify t′ = t and integrate over t. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (16.99) gives an unimportant constant which can be neglected. Furthermore, the theta function in the second term leads to θ(0) = 1 2 . The higher order terms all vanish because of opposing theta functions, namely, θ(t − t1)θ(t1 − t2) ··· θ(tn − t)=0. (16.100) Consequently, in this case, we can determine the eﬀective action exactly (see Eq. (16.92)) Γ[A]= i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ ∫ dte−τ (− iτ 2 ) A(t)= 1 2 ∫ dtA(t). (16.101) This indeed coincides with the perturbative calculation of the eﬀec- tive action for this system at zero temperature. The second model, which we would like to discuss, is the theory of massless fermions interacting with an external gauge ﬁeld in 1 + 1 dimensions (namely, it is the Schwinger model, discussed extensively in Section 13.2 from various points of view, without the kinetic term for the gauge ﬁeld). It is an exactly soluble model at zero tempera- ture implying that the eﬀective action can be obtained in exact closed January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 431 16.3 Effective actions 421 form. Here we derive the exact eﬀective action at zero temperature in the proper time formalism. The Lagrangian density is given by (see Eq. (16.82) with m = 0 and recall that we have set the coupling strength e =1) L = ¯ψγμ(i∂μ − Aμ)ψ, μ =0, 1, (16.102) where a standard representation for the two dimensional Dirac ma- trices is given in Eq. (13.52). Exploiting the gauge invariance of the theory (Schwinger model), we choose the gauge condition ∂μAμ =0, (16.103) for simplicity which allows us to write the gauge ﬁeld, in 1 + 1 di- mensions, as (see, for example, Eq. (13.62)) Aμ = ϵμν∂νφ, A/ = γμAμ = −γ5∂/φ, (16.104) where φ denotes a scalar ﬁeld. Furthermore, the free fermion propa- gator, in this massless case, can be written as (see also Eq. (16.88)) S(ˆp/)= 1 ˆp/ = ˆp/ ˆp2 , (16.105) where the Feynman prescription is understood. Introducing a complete set of coordinate and momentum basis states, Eq. (16.90) takes the form ∂τ ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = ∫ d2x1d2p1⟨x, τ |x1, 0⟩⟨x1, 0|p1⟩ 〈 p1| ˆp/ ˆp2 A/(ˆx)|x′, 0 〉 = ∫ d2x1 d2p1 (2π)2 ⟨x, τ |x1, 0⟩ p1/ p2 1 A/(x′) e−ip1·(x1−x′). (16.106) This can be integrated to give January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 432 422 16 Proper time formalism ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = δ2(x − x′)+ ∫ τ 0 dτ ′ ∫ d2x1 d2p1 (2π)2 ⟨x, τ |x1, 0⟩ × p/1A/(x′) p2 1 e−ip1·(x1−x′), (16.107) where the ﬁrst homogeneous term is needed for the normalization of the state (see Eq. (16.21)). As before, this integral equation can be iterated to give ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = δ2(x − x′)+ ∫ τ 0 dτ ′ ∫ d2p1 (2π)2 p/1A/(x′) p2 1 e−ip1·(x−x′) + ∫ τ 0 dτ ′ ∫ τ ′ 0 dτ ′′ ∫ d2x1 d2p1 (2π)2 d2p2 (2π)2 p/2A/(x1) p2 2 p/1A/(x′) p2 1 × e−ip2·(x−x1)−ip1·(x1−x′) + ··· . (16.108) We note here that at the end, we have to take a trace which involves aDirac traceaswellassetting x = x′ and integrating over x.In this limit, the ﬁrst term gives an unimportant constant which can be neglected. The linear term (in A) vanishes because the integrand is odd in p1. The terms higher than quadratic (in A) can also be shown to vanish so that the only meaningful nontrivial term on the right hand side is the term quadratic in the ﬁelds. Using the properties of the Dirac matrices in two dimensions (see Section 13.2), we can evaluate the Dirac trace (remember also to use the gauge condition Eq. (16.103)) and carrying out the momentum integral, we ﬁnally obtain Tr ⟨x, τ |x, 0⟩ = − iτ 2 π ∫ d2xAμ(x)Aμ(x), (16.109) Therefore, the eﬀective action, Eq. (16.89), is determined to be Γ[A]= i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ e−τ (− iτ 2 π ) ∫ d2xAμ(x)Aμ(x) = 1 2π ∫ d2xAμ(x)A μ(x). (16.110) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 433 16.3 Effective actions 423 This is exactly the eﬀective action for the Schwinger model (in gauge Eq. (16.103) and with e = 1) evaluated in, see for example, Eq. (13.111). (If we had not used the gauge condition Eq. (16.103) in evaluating the trace in Eq. (16.108), we would have obtained exactly the same gauge invariant eﬀective action as in Eq. (13.111).) The simplest way to see that the higher order terms in A in Eq. (16.108) vanish is as follows. Let us recall from Eq. (16.104) that, in the gauge Eq. (16.103), we can write (remember Eq. (16.6)) A/(ˆx)= −γ5∂/φ(ˆx)= iγ5[ˆp/, φ(ˆx)]. (16.111) As a result, we can write (remember that ˆp/ ˆp2 = 1 ˆp/ ) 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx)= −iγ5 1 ˆp/ [ˆp/, φ(ˆx)] = −iγ5 (φ(ˆx) − 1 ˆp/ φ(ˆx)ˆp/), (16.112) wherewehaveused thefactthat γ5 and γμ,μ =0, 1 anti-commute. This leads to 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx) 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx)= −iγ5(φ(ˆx) − 1 ˆp/ phi(ˆx)ˆp/) 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx), = −iγ5(φ(ˆx) 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx) − 1 ˆp/ φ(ˆx)A/(ˆx)) = −iγ5[φ(ˆx), 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx)], (16.113) where, in the last line, we have used the fact that φ(ˆx)and A/(ˆx) commute (since both of them are functions of ˆx). Using this, we can now show that Tr ( 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx) )n+1 =Tr ( − iγ5 n [ φ(ˆx), ( 1 ˆp/ A/(ˆx) )n]) , (16.114) where n> 0. For n> 1, the momentum integrals in the trace are ﬁnite and, then, the trace vanishes because of cyclicity. For n =1, the momentum integrals are divergent and one can not use the cyclicity of the trace and, therefore, the terms for n =0, 1needtobeevaluated explicitly which we have done in arriving at Eq. (16.110). January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 434 424 16 Proper time formalism 16.3.2 Finite temperature At ﬁnite temperature, the Green’s functions (boson/fermion) become temperature dependent and more complicated in order to incorporate the periodicity/anti-periodicity properties. That makes the proper time evaluation of the eﬀective action (for interacting theories) quite diﬃcult and one way to evaluate the eﬀective action in Eq. (16.85) is through a Taylor expansion of the logarithm which coincides with the perturbative calculation. Here we will describe an alternative method for evaluation of eﬀective actions at ﬁnite temperature. (It is also worth noting here that the proper time formalism naturally introduces a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization at zero tem- perature. At ﬁnite temperature, on the other hand, the temperature dependent part of the amplitudes are ultraviolet ﬁnite and, therefore, there is no need for regularization.) We recall from discussions in Chapter 14 that there are two ma- jor formalisms to describe ﬁeld theories at ﬁnite temperature. The imaginary time formalism (also known as the Matsubara formalism), where time is rotated to the imaginary axis and the time (interval) is traded for temperature, is quite useful in calculating partition func- tions (as we have done in Section 16.2 (aswellasinChapter 14)). However, they are not so useful in calculating eﬀective actions. The reason is simple. The eﬀective actions give rise to Feynman (time or- dered) correlation functions whereas the imaginary time formalism leads naturally to retarded and advanced Green’s functions. As a result, we need to use the real time formalism where both time and temperature are present. The price one has to pay for this is that the (dynamical) ﬁeld degrees of freedom in the theory are doubled. We will use the closed time path formalism in our discussion for its simplicity and versatility. The formalism is characterized by a path in the complex time plane as shown in Fig. 16.1, with the original ﬁelds on the C+ branch and the doubled ﬁelds on the C− branch. The vertical branch C⊥ decouples from the correlation functions. We recall from Eq. (16.85) that since Γ[A]= −i Tr ln(i∂/ − m − A/) − i Tr ln(i∂/ − m), (16.115) taking the functional derivative with respect to the external ﬁeld, we obtain (remember that the coupling constant has been set to unity) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 435 16.3 Effective actions 425 C+ C− TT ′ T − iβ C⊥ Figure 16.1: The closed time path contour in the complex t plane. Here T →−∞, while T ′ →∞ and β denotes the inverse temperature (in units of the Boltzmann constant k). δΓ[A] δAμ(t, x) = i tr (γμS(t, x; t, x)), δΓ[A] δAμ(t, −p) = i tr (γμS(t, t; p)). (16.116) Here “tr” denotes the Dirac trace in higher dimensions (in 0 + 1 dimension, as we see from Eq. (16.91), there is no Dirac trace since there are no gamma matrices) and the quantity on the right hand side in Eq. (16.116) is the complete current of the theory which is related to the exact fermion Green’s function (not the free Green’s func- tion) for the interacting theory at coincident points. Therefore, if we can determine the complete fermion Green’s function of the theory, which satisﬁes the complete dynamical equations of motion, satisﬁes the relevant symmetry properties as well as the anti-periodicity con- dition needed at ﬁnite temperature (for fermions), we can determine the complete eﬀective action by integrating either of the equations in Eq. (16.116). Let us illustrate this with a simple example, namely, the 0+1 dimensional fermion in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld dis- cussed in Eq. (16.91) (it can also be carried out in more complicated theories, at least formally). At ﬁnite temperature, the theory deﬁned on the contour in Fig. 16.1 has doubled ﬁelds. In particular, there are two external ﬁelds A± on the two real branches C± of the contour and the com- plete fermion Green’s function Sc(t, t′) satisﬁes the dynamical equa- tions January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 436 426 16 Proper time formalism (i∂t − m − Ac(t))Sc(t, t ′)= δc(t − t ′), Sc(t, t ′)(i ←− ∂t′ + m + Ac(t′)) = −δc(t − t ′). (16.117) Here the subscript c denotes a function deﬁned on the contour in Fig. 16.1 and the step function on the contour is deﬁned as θc(t − t ′)= ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ θ(t − t′) if both t, t′ ∈ C+, θ(t′ − t) if both t, t′ ∈ C−, 1if t ∈ C− and t′ ∈ C+, 0if t ∈ C+and t′ ∈ C−, (16.118) leading to the delta function on the contour in the standard manner as δc(t − t′)= ∂tθc(t − t′). (16.119) Equation (16.117) can be exactly solved and the Green’s function can determined to be Sc(t, t ′)= −i(θc(t − t′)C − θc(t′ − t)D) × e−im(t−t′)−i ∫ t t′ dt′′ c Ac(t′′ c ), (16.120) where C and D are two constants (to be determined) satisfying C + D =1, (16.121) for Eq. (16.117) to hold. Furthermore, the anti-periodicity of the fermion Green’s function, namely, Sc(−∞,t ′)= −Sc(−∞ − iβ, t′), (16.122) where β is deﬁned in Eq. (14.6) leads to January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 437 16.3 Effective actions 427 D = Ce−βm−i ∫ −∞−iβ −∞ dtc Ac(tc) = Ce−βm−iac = Ce−βm−i(a+−a−). (16.123) Here we have used the fact that the vertical branch of the contour decouples and have deﬁned ac = ∫ −∞C− −∞C+ dtc Ac(tc) = ∫ ∞ −∞ dtA+(t) − ∫ ∞ −∞ dtA−(t)=(a+ − a−), (16.124) where in the ﬁrst line, the lower limit of integration corresponds to the left most point on C+ while the upper limit corresponds to the left most point on C− (see Fig. 16.1). (The relative negative sign in the second term arises because the sense of time ﬂow on C− is opposite to that on C+.) Equations (16.121) and (16.123) determine C =1 − nF (m + iac β ) =1 − nF (m + i β (a+ − a−)) , D =1 − C = nF (m + iac β ) = nF (m + i β (a+ − a−)), (16.125) where nF denotes the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and this de- termines the complete fermion Green’s function, for this theory, to be (see Eq. (16.120)) Sc(t, t ′)= −i (θc(t − t′) − nF (m + iac β )) × e−im(t−t′)−i ∫ t t′ dt′′ c Ac(t′′ c ). (16.126) It is easy to check that this Green’s function also satisﬁes the anti- periodicity condition Sc(t, −∞)= −Sc(t, −∞ − iβ), (16.127) as it should.

(16.116) takes the form (there is no Dirac trace) δΓ[ac] δAc(t) = ∂Γ[ac] ∂ac δac δAc(t) = ∂Γ[ac] ∂ac = 1 2 tanh βm + iac 2 , (16.129) wherewehaveused thedeﬁnition of ac in Eq. (16.124) in the inter- mediate step. This can be easily integrated to give Γ[ac]= −i ln cosh βm + iac 2 = −i ln cosh βm + i(a+ − a−) 2 . (16.130) We can subtract out the value of the action at zero ﬁelds to obtain the normalized eﬀective action as Γ[ac]= −i ln cosh βm+iac 2 cosh βm 2 = −i ln (cos ac 2 + i tanh βm 2 sin ac 2 ) = −i ln (cos a+ − a− 2 + i tanh βm 2 sin a+ − a− 2 ) . (16.131) If we now restrict the eﬀective action to only the original ﬁelds (on the C+ branch), this leads to Γ[a+,a− =0]= −i ln (cos a+ 2 + i tanh βm 2 sin a+ 2 ) .

However, Eq. (16.131) describes the complete eﬀective action at ﬁnite tempera- ture which contains a lot more information. (Note that this eﬀective action reduces to Eq. (16.101) at zero temperature, β →∞,as it should. 16.4 References A. Das, Finite Temperature Field Theory, World Scientiﬁc Pub- lishing (1997). A. Das and G. V. Dunne,Phys. Rev. D 57, 5023 (1998) . A.

Euler studied this function for real parameters s because complex analysis had not yet been developed. This series is convergent only for s> 1 as can be seen below. The ratio test for a series of the form ∑∞ n=1 an is inconclusive in this case since lim n→∞ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ an+1 an ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = lim n→∞ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ( n n +1 )s∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ → 1. (17.2) Note that for convergence of the series, this ratio should be (< 1). Therefore, one has to go to another test. There are many, but let us consider the Cauchy condensation test where, given the series in Eq. (17.1), we look at the series ∞∑ n=0 2 na2n = ∞∑ n=0 2n × 1 (2n)s = ∞∑ n=0 2 (1−s)n. (17.3) 431 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 442 432 17 Zeta function regularization This is a geometric series with ratio 21−s which is smaller than 1 for s> 1. Therefore, for s> 1, this series will be ﬁnitely convergent and ζ(s) is (absolutely) convergent for s> 1. The reason Euler wanted to study this series is because he was interested in the prime numbers. (Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 which are divisible only by 1 and the number itself.) Euler showed that the zeta function can also be written as a product in- volving only prime numbers as ζ(s)= ∏ p (1 − 1 ps )−1 ,s > 1, (17.4) where p stands for a prime number and the product is over all the prime numbers. This can be seen as follows ∏ p (1 − 1 ps )−1 = (1 − 1 2s )−1 (1 − 1 3s )−1 (1 − 1 5s )−1 ··· = (1+ 1 2s + 1 22s + ··· )( 1+ 1 3s + 1 32s + ··· ) × (1+ 1 5s + 1 52s + ··· ) ··· =1 + 1 2s + 1 3s + 1 4s + 1 5s + 1 6s + 1 7s + ··· = ∞∑ n=1 1 ns = ζ(s). (17.5) Basically, this uses the fact that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers and the product on the right hand side of Eq. (17.4) generates the inverse of all possible products of primes raised to the power s. This is a fundamental relation in the sense that the zeta function, which is deﬁned in terms of natural numbers, can also be written in terms of prime numbers. This connection opened up a new branch of mathematics known as analytic number theory. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 443 17.1 Riemann zeta function 433 Euler evaluated the exact values of ζ(2k) in a remarkable man- ner. For example, let us look at ζ(2) = ∞∑ n=1 1 n2 . (17.6) To evaluate this, let us recall that any quadratic polynomial can be written as a product ax2 + bx + c = c (1 − x x1 )( 1 − x x2 ) , (17.7) where x1, x2 are the two roots of the quadratic polynomial equation, x1 + x2 = − b a , x1x2 = c a . This can be generalized to any polynomial in that any polynomial can be factored in terms of its roots (values where the function vanishes). Let us consider now the ratio sin x x which can be written in terms of its roots as sin x x = (1 − x2 π2 )( 1 − x2 (2π)2 )( 1 − x2 (3π)2 ) ··· × (1 − x2 (nπ)2 ) ··· . (17.8) Here we have used the fact that any function can be factorized in terms of its roots and that the roots of sin x x are given by x = ±nπ, n = 1, 2, 3, ··· . The overall multiplicative constant is ﬁxed from the nor- malization to be lim x→0 sin x x =1. (17.9) Multiplying out all the factors in Eq. (17.8), we obtain sin x x =1 − x2 ( 1 π2 + 1 (2π)2 + 1 (3π)2 + ··· ) + O(x4) =1 − x2 π2 ∞∑ n=1 1 n2 + O(x4)=1 − x2 π2 ζ(2) + O(x4). (17.10) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 444 434 17 Zeta function regularization On the other hand, we can Taylor expand and write sin x x = 1 x (x − x3 3! + x5 5! − x7 7! + ··· ) =1 − x2 3! + x4 5! − x6 7! + ··· . (17.11) Comparing the coeﬃcients of the x2 terms in Eqs. (17.10) and (17.11) we obtain − 1 π2 ζ(2) = − 1 6 , or,ζ(2) = π2 6 . (17.12) In fact, using this logic, Euler evaluated all the ζ(2k) func- tions in terms of Bernoulli’s numbers as follows. Note that the se- ries representation of x cot x leads to (actually, we have x cot x = ∑∞ n=−∞ x2 x2−n2π2 ) x cot x =1 − 2 ∞∑ n=1 x2 n2π2 − x2 =1 − 2 ∞∑ n=1 x2 n2π2 1 1 − x2 n2π2 =1 − 2 ∞∑ n=1 x2 n2π2 ∞∑ k=0 ( x2 n2π2 )k =1 − 2 ∞∑ k=1 ( ∞∑ n=1 1 n2k ) ( x2 π2 )k =1 − 2 ∞∑ k=1 ζ(2k) ( x2 π2 )k . (17.13) On the other hand, Euler knew (from his friend Bernoulli) that we can write x cot x =1 − ∞∑ k=1 22k|B2k| (2k)! (x2)k, (17.14) where B2k denote the even Bernoulli’s numbers. Therefore, compar- ing the two expressions in Eqs. (17.13) and (17.14), we determine January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 445 17.1 Riemann zeta function 435 ζ(2k)= (2π)2k 2(2k)! |B2k| = (2π)2k 2(2k)! (−1)k+1B2k. (17.15) Here we have used the property of the Bernoulli’s numbers that B2k is positive (negative) for k odd (even) for k ≥ 1. These values are related to moments (Mellin transformation) of the Einstein integral (involving Bose-Einstein distribution functions). The values of the zeta function for a few of the odd integer values, ζ(2k +1), can also be calculated, but they are not very interesting. (ζ(3) is known to be irrational.) Euler’s zeta function diverges for s = 1 (remember ln(1 − x)= − ∑∞ n=1 xn n ) ζ(1) = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + ··· = − ln(1 − 1) →∞. (17.16) Even though the divergence appears to be logarithmic, we will see later that there is a simple pole singularity at s = 1 when viewedina regularized manner. A simple example of how a naively logarithmic singularity may manifest as a pole when regularized is as follows ∫ 1 0 dt t =ln t∣ ∣ ∣1 0 =ln 1 − ln 0 = − ln 0 →∞, (17.17) which is a logarithmic singularity. However, if we view the integral in a limiting (regularized) manner, we obtain lim ϵ→0+ ∫ 1 0 dt t1−ϵ = lim ϵ→0+ ∫ 1 0 dtt ϵ−1 = lim ϵ→0+ tϵ ϵ ∣ ∣ ∣1 0 = lim ϵ→0+ 1 ϵ , (17.18) which has a simple pole behavior. Euler’s zeta function also diverges for s = 0 (of course, the series is deﬁned only for s> 1) ζ(0) = 1+1+1+1+ ··· → ∞. (17.19) In fact, it diverges for all negative integer values of s January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 446 436 17 Zeta function regularization ζ(−1) = 1 +2+3+4+ ··· → ∞, ζ(−2) = 1 + 22 +32 +42 + ··· → ∞, ... ζ(−n)=1 + 2 n +3n +4n + ··· → ∞. (17.20) 17.1.2 Riemann’s zeta function During the time of Riemann, complex analysis had been developed fully and so he viewed Euler’s zeta function as a holomorphic function in the parameter s and analytically continued it to the entire complex plane. He did this in three essential steps and this regularized away the divergences in Eqs. (17.19) and (17.20) except for the one at s = 1 in Eq. (17.16). As the ﬁrst step he deﬁned the zeta function for complex values of s as (see Eq. (17.1)) ζ(s)= ∞∑ n=1 1 ns ,s = σ + iλ, Re s> 1. (17.21) Here σ, λ are assumed to be real. This series can be given an integral representation ζ(s)= ∞∑ n=1 1 ns = ∞∑ n=1 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−1e−nx, Re s> 1 = 1 Γ(s) ∞∑ n=0 ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−1e−(n+1)x = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−1e−x (1 − e−x)−1 = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dx xs−1 ex − 1 , Re s> 1. (17.22) This integral representation is known as the Mellin transform of the Bose-Einstein distribution function (Mf (s)= ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−1f (x)). (We note parenthetically that the Gamma function is deﬁned for Re s> 0 January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 447 17.1 Riemann zeta function 437 which is compatible with our function deﬁned for Re s> 1. When Re s is not greater than 1, interchanging the sum and integral in the intermediate step in Eq. (17.22) is not permitted. Therefore, Riemann’s zeta function coincides with Euler’s only in the region where the series is convergent, namely, Re s> 1.) The next step is to deﬁne this function for Re s> 0 except at s = 1 (namely, on the right half of the complex parameter space except for the point s = 1). To do this, we note that the zeta function in Eq. (17.21) can be written in terms of the alternating zeta function in the following way ∞∑ n=1 (−1)n ns + ζ(s)= ∞∑ n=1 ((−1)n +1) 1 ns =2 ∞∑ n=1 1 (2n)s =2 1−s ∞∑ n=1 1 ns =2 1−sζ(s), (17.23) so that we can write ζ(s)= 1 1 − 21−s ∞∑ n=1 (−1)n+1 ns = 1 1 − 21−s η(s), (17.24) where η(s) is known as the alternating zeta function. Here the singu- larity at s = 1 has been explicitly factored out and the pole structure at s = 1 is already manifest. Alternating series, in general, have much better convergence properties and it can be checked that the series in Eq. (17.24) is deﬁned for Re s> 0,s ̸=1. This has the integral representation in terms of the Mellin trans- form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function. In fact, following the same steps as in Eq. (17.22), we obtain ζ(s)= 1 1 − 21−s ∞∑ n=1 (−1)n+1 ns = 1 (1 − 21−s) ∞∑ n=1(−1)n+1 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−1e−nx = 1 (1 − 21−s)Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−1 ∞∑ n=0(−1)ne−(n+1)x January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 448 438 17 Zeta function regularization = 1 (1 − 21−s)Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−1e−x (1+ e−x)−1 = 1 (1 − 21−s)Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dx xs−1 ex +1 . (17.25) This gives an integral representation for the Riemann zeta function on the right half of the complex plane except at s =1. The last step involves analytically continuing the function to the left half of the complex plane. To this end, Riemann derived two equivalent functional relations of the forms ζ(1 − s) = 2(2π)−s cos πs 2 Γ(s) ζ(s), Re s> 0, ζ(s) = 2(2π)s−1 sin πs 2 Γ(1 − s) ζ(1 − s), Re s< 1. (17.26) The two relations are obtained from each other by letting s → 1 − s and they allow us to extend the zeta function to the left half of the complex plane. The zeta function is now deﬁned on the entire complex plane except at s = 1. (It coincides with the series representation only when the series does not diverge, otherwise it is a diﬀerent function which is holomorphic everywhere in the complex parameter space except for a simple pole at s = 1 which we show next.) Let us evaluate ζ(s) from its integral representation in Eq. (17.22), ζ(s)= 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dx xs−1 ex − 1 = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dx xs−1e−x 1 − e−x = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dxxs−2e−x (1+ x 2 + x2 12 + ··· ) = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dx (xs−2 + xs−1 2 + xs 12 + ··· ) e−x = 1 Γ(s) (Γ(s − 1) + 1 2 Γ(s)+ 1 12 Γ(s +1)+ ··· ) = 1 s − 1 + 1 2 + s 12 + 1 Γ(s) ∞∑ n=2 anΓ(s + n). (17.27) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 449 17.1 Riemann zeta function 439 This shows that the zeta function has only a simple pole at s =1 with residue 1. In fact, the series of terms in Eq. (17.27) can be summed exactly as s → 1 and leads to ζ(s) s→1 −−−→ 1 s − 1 + γ + O(s − 1), (17.28) where γ denotes Euler’s constant. This relation can also be obtained from the (second) functional relation in Eq. (17.26) which we don’t go into. We also note from Eq. (17.27) that ζ(0) = −1+ 1 2 = − 1 2 , (ζ ′(0) = − 1 2 ln 2π) . (17.29) Here we have used the fact that Γ(0) →∞ so that the remainder of the terms in Eq. (17.27) vanish. Therefore, the singular behavior of ζ(0) (see Eq. (17.19)) has been regularized and it is well behaved there. Note also from Eq. (17.27) that ζ(−1) = − 1 2 + 1 2 − 1 12 = − 1 12 , (17.30) which is useful in the studies of string theory, Casimir energy and other physical problems. We note from the second functional relation in Eq. (17.26) that, for s = −2k with k a positive integer, we have ζ(−2k) = 2(2π)−2k−1 sin π 2 (−2k)Γ(1 + 2k)ζ(1 + 2k) = −2(2π)−2k−1 sin kπΓ(1 + 2k)ζ(1 + 2k)=0, (17.31) wherewehaveused thefactthatΓ(1 + 2k)and ζ(1 + 2k)are both ﬁnite for k positive. Similarly, for s =1−2k with k a positive integer, the second functional relation leads to ζ(1 − 2k) = 2(2π)−2k sin π 2 (1 − 2k)Γ(2k)ζ(2k) =2(2π)−2k(−1)k(2k − 1)!ζ(2k)= − B2k 2k , (17.32) where we haves used Eq. (17.15). This analysis shows that all the divergences of the zeta function have been regularized except for the one at s =1. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 450 440 17 Zeta function regularization 17.2 Zeta function regularization We have seen that the Riemann zeta function regularizes all the sin- gularities of the Euler zeta function, except for the one at s =1, through analytic continuation. In quantum ﬁeld theory, we know that there are divergences and the idea is to explore if the techniques of the zeta function can be applied there as well providing a regular- ization for the singularities. If this can be done, it will correspond to a gauge invariant regularization. To proceed, let us recall from Eq. (17.22) that we can write (we have changed the integration variable from x to τ for reasons that will be clear shortly) ζ(s)= 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ s−1 eτ − 1 = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 ∞∑ n=1 e−nτ , (17.33) so that if we deﬁne a diagonal matrix, ¯A, of the form ¯A = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ 1 2 3 . . . ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , (17.34) then, we can write Eq. (17.33) also as ζ(s)= 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 Tr e− ¯Aτ . (17.35) This suggests that we can deﬁne a zeta function associated with a N × N Hermitian matrix A with real, positive eigenvalues λ1,λ2, ··· ,λN as ζA(s)= N∑ n=1 1 λs n = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 Tr e−Aτ . (17.36) Here the eigenvalues are assumed to be real and positive, but are not necessarily nondegenerate. Looking back at Eq. (16.43) for matrices, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 451 17.2 Zeta function regularization 441 we recognize that we can identify from Eq. (17.36) that the zeta function for such a matrix can also be written as ζA(s)=Tr A−s = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 Tr e−Aτ . (17.37) Either from the deﬁnition in Eq. (17.36) in terms of the series or from Eq. (17.37) we can derive the following properties (for example, using Eq. (17.37)) ζ A λ (s)=Tr ( A λ )−s = λs Tr A −s = λsζA(s), ζA(0) = Tr \u0000 = N = dimension of the matrix, ζ ′ A(0) = dζA(s) ds ∣ ∣ ∣s=0 =Tr d ds e−s ln A∣ ∣ ∣s=0 = −Tr ln A = − ln det A, (17.38) wherewehaveused thedeﬁnition of ζA(s) in Eq. (17.37) as well as the relation det A = eTr ln A in the last step. Although we have derived these properties for ﬁnite dimensional matrices, they hold equally well in the inﬁnite dimensional case and are useful in various calculations. In quantum mechanics as well as in quantum ﬁeld theory, square matrices are associated with operators and, in this way, one can also deﬁne zeta functions associated with inﬁnite dimensional operators. This leads naturally to what is commonly known as the zeta function regularization in quantum ﬁeld theory. For example, for an inﬁnite dimensional self-adjoint operator ˆO with (real) positive eigenvalues, we can deﬁne the zeta function as ζ ˆO(s)=Tr ( ˆO)−s = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 Tr e− ˆOτ , (17.39) where the “Trace” can be taken in any complete basis, as we have discussed earlier. (For continuum operators, trace involves an inte- gral as we have already discussed in Eq. (16.48) in addition to a sum over any matrix indices.) All the properties derived in Eq. (17.38) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 452 442 17 Zeta function regularization carry over to this inﬁnite dimensional case as well. In particular, we note that, in an inﬁnite dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory, ζ(0) is divergent and if it does not depend on the dynamics, it can be neglected in various calculations. As is clear from Eq. (17.38), zeta function can easily calculate det ˆO or Tr ln ˆO of any operator ˆO.This is what is involved in the calculation of a partition function at ﬁnite temperature or the eﬀective action in a theory interacting with a background ﬁeld. Let us next show an example of how the partition function of the simple bosonic harmonic oscillator can be calculated using this method. 17.2.1 Partition function for the bosonic oscillator Let us start with the simple example of the bosonic harmonic os- cillator which is already discussed in Section 16.2.1. The partition function is already deﬁned in Eq. (16.42) to be Z(β)= [det (− d2 dt2 + ω2)]− 1 2 , (17.40) where, as explained in the last chapter, t is the imaginary (Euclidean) time. Therefore, the relevant operator, in this case, is ˆO = − d2 dt2 +ω2. To calculate the zeta function (determinant) associated with this op- erator, we need the eigenvalues of the operator ˆO on the space of pe- riodic eigenfunctions (see discussion following Eq. (16.42)), namely, we are looking for solutions to (− d2 dt2 + ω2) ψn(t)= λnψn(t),ψn(t + β)= ψn(t). (17.41) Clearly, there are two general solutions to this second order equation ψn(t) ∼ {sin 2πnt β cos 2πnt β ,n =0, ±1, ±2, ··· , (17.42) which satisfy the periodicity condition and lead to the eigenvalues λn = ( 2πn β )2 + ω2 = ( 2π β )2 (n2 + ν2),ν = βω 2π , (17.43) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 453 17.2 Zeta function regularization 443 where n =0, ±1, ±2, ··· . As a result, we can write the zeta function for the harmonic oscillator to be (see Eq. (17.36)) ζHO(s)= ∞∑ n=−∞ 1 λs n = ( β 2π )2s ∞∑ n=−∞ 1 (n2 + ν2)s = 1 ω2s +2 ( β 2π )2s ∞∑ n=1 1 (n2 + ν2)s = 1 ω2s +2 ( β 2π )2s Eν2 1 (s;1), (17.44) where the Epstein function Eν2 1 (s;1) is given by Eν2 1 (s;1) = − ν−2s 2 + √πΓ(s − 1 2 ) 2Γ(s)ν2s−1 + 2√π Γ(s) ∞∑ n=1 ( nπ ν )s− 1 2 Ks− 1 2 (2πnν), (17.45) with Kν(z) denoting the modiﬁed Bessel function. Equation (17.44), together with Eq. (17.45), can now be written as ζHO(s)= 1 Γ(s) F (s), (17.46) where F (s)= √π ( β 2π )2s [ν1−2sΓ (s − 1 2 ) +4 ∞∑ n=1 ( nπ ν )s− 1 2 Ks− 1 2 (2πnν)]. (17.47) We note that F (s) is an analytic function near the origin (s → 0). We also recall that as s → 0, Γ(s) → 1 s , ( 1 Γ(s) )′ → 1, (17.48) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 454 444 17 Zeta function regularization so that ∂ζHO(s) ∂s ∣ ∣ ∣s=0 = [( 1 Γ(s) )′ F (s)+ 1 Γ(s) F ′(s)] s=0 = F (0). (17.49) F (0) can be calculated from Eq. (17.47) and with a little bit of alge- bra, as in Section 16.2.1,leads to F (0) = −2ln(2sinh πν)=2 ln (2 sinh πν)−1 =2 ln (2sinh βω 2 )−1 = ∂ζHO(s) ∂s ∣ ∣ ∣s=0, (17.50) wherewehaveused thedeﬁnition K− 1 2 (z)= √ π 2z e−z as well as rela- tions derived earlier such as Eq. (16.65) (and made the identiﬁcation in Eq. (17.49) in the last step). Using Eqs. (17.38) and (17.40), we now obtain Z(β)= [det (− d2 dt2 + ω2)]− 1 2 =exp [ 1 2 ∂ζHO(s) ∂s ] s=0 = 1 2sinh βω 2 , (17.51) which was already derived in Eq. (16.67) in the proper time formal- ism. This illustrates how partition functions can be obtained with zeta function regularization. 17.3 Heat kernel method In the last chapter, we calculated the Green’s function and the ef- fective action for simple theories through the proper time method. This method, however, becomes complicated when there are nontriv- ial backgrounds present. For example, a quantum ﬁeld theory may be deﬁned on a curved manifold (namely, interacting with a background gravitational ﬁeld) with or without boundaries; if it is charged, it may be interacting with a background electromagnetic ﬁeld or any other kind of external sources. In these cases, the solutions of the proper January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 455 17.3 Heat kernel method 445 time evolution equations may be diﬃcult to obtain in a useful form and the heat kernel method comes in handy. It leads to the one loop Green’s function as well as the one loop eﬀective action for the theory interacting with a background in a standard manner which we will describe in this section. Suppose, we have a quantum mechanical operator ˆO in the co- ordinate representation. Then the heat kernel associated with this operator is deﬁned as (see also Eq. (17.39)) K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= ⟨x|e−τ ˆO|x′⟩ = ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩, (17.52) where τ represents the proper time introduced earlier, with the evo- lution generated by the Hamiltonian ˆO. The name “heat kernel” arises because this quantity satisﬁes the evolution equation ∂τ K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= −O(x)K ˆO(x, x′; τ ), (17.53) with the initial condition (see Eq. (17.52)) K ˆO(x, x′;0) = δ(x − x′). (17.54) O(x), in Eq. (17.53), represents the coordinate representation of ˆO and this equation resembles the heat diﬀusion equation. Let us recall from Eq. (17.39) that, in the coordinate basis, we can write ζ ˆO(s)= 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 Tr e−τ ˆO = ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1⟨x|e−τ ˆO|x⟩ = ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 K ˆO(x, x; τ ) = ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 ζ ˆO(s, x), (17.55) where D denotes the number of space-time dimensions and we have used the deﬁnition of the heat kernel in Eq. (17.52). In addition, we January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 456 446 17 Zeta function regularization have allowed for the space to be curved with a metric gμν(x)which leads to a factor of |g(x)| 1 2 in the integration measure and makes the volume element invariant under diﬀeomorphisms. (Depending on the number of dimensions g(x)=det gμν(x) can be positive or negative in a space with Minkowski signatures which is why we have the magnitude of |g(x)|. In ﬂat space-time, |g(x)| =1.) We have also deﬁned a generalized zeta function as ζ ˆO(s, x)= 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1⟨x|e−τ ˆO|x⟩ = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 K ˆO(x, x; τ ). (17.56) Furthermore, introducing a complete set of basis states of the oper- ator ˆO,namely, ˆO|ψn⟩ = λn|ψn⟩, (17.57) we can write Eq. (17.56) as ζ ˆO(s, x)= 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 ∑ n ⟨x|ψn⟩⟨ψn|e−τ ˆO|x⟩ = 1 Γ(s) ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s−1 ∑ n e−τλn⟨x|ψn⟩⟨ψn|x⟩ = ∑ n ψn(x)ψ∗ n(x) λs n , (17.58) which is also known as the spectral resolution of the generalized zeta function. Let us consider a real, massive scalar ﬁeld interacting with a gravitational background ﬁeld (in arbitrary dimensions), we can write the action as S = 1 2 ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 (gμν∂μφ∂νφ − m2φ2) = − 1 2 ∫ dDx|g(x)| 1 2 φ ( 1 |g| 1 2 ∂μ(|g| 1 2 gμν∂ν)+ m2) φ, (17.59) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 457 17.3 Heat kernel method 447 where we have integrated the ﬁrst term by parts and have neglected the surface term. Here gμν(x) denotes the contravariant metric tensor of the manifold (and g(x)=det gμν(x)). Furthermore, if we identify O(x)= − ( 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ∂μ(|g(x)| 1 2 gμν(x)∂ν)+ m2) = −(DμDμ + m2), (17.60) where Dμ denotes the gravitational covariant derivative, then this is simply the inverse of the Green’s function (see also Eqs. (16.4) and (16.5)) in the presence of gravitational background ﬁelds, namely, ˆG = 1 ˆO = ∫ ∞ 0 dτe−τ ˆO. (17.61) Therefore, it follows that the Green’s function can be identiﬁed with (recall Eqs. (16.4), (16.5) and (17.52)) G(x − x′)= ⟨x| ˆG|x′⟩ = ∫ ∞ 0 dτK ˆO(x, x′; τ ), (17.62) and satisﬁes the equation O(x)G(x − x′)= 1 |g| 1 2 δD(x − x′). (17.63) The factor of |g|− 1 2 on the right hand side (which can be written in a more symmetric form as well) arises from the fact that, in a curved manifold, ⟨x|x′⟩ = 1 |g| 1 2 δD(x − x′), ∫ dDx |g| 1 2 |x⟩⟨x| = \u0000 , (17.64) so that we naturally have January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 458 448 17 Zeta function regularization ⟨x|x′⟩ = ⟨x|\u0000 |x′⟩ = ∫ dDy |g| 1 2 ⟨x|y⟩⟨y|x′⟩ = ∫ dDy |g| 1 2 1 |g| 1 2 δD(x − y) 1 |g| 1 2 δD(y − x′) = 1 |g| 1 2 δD(x − x′). (17.65) Here we have suppressed the coordinate dependencies of the factors |g| 1 2 for simplicity which are quite easy to ﬁgure out. (We parenthet- ically note here that the operator O(x) in Eq. (17.60) is self-adjoint only with an integration measure ∫ dDx |g| 1 2 .) Furthermore, we note that, since the action in Eq. (17.59) is quadratic in the ﬁeld variables φ(x), the generating functional is given by Z[gμν]= eiW [gμν ] = N [det ˆO]− 1 2 , (17.66) so that, up to a constant, the eﬀective action is given by (see, for example, Eq. (16.84)) W [gμν]= i 2 ln det ˆO = i 2 Tr ln ˆO = − i 2 dζ ˆO(s) ds ∣ ∣ ∣s=0 = − i 2 ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ Tr e−τ ˆO = − i 2 ∫ dDx|g(x)| 1 2 dζ ˆO(s, x) ds ∣ ∣ ∣s=0 = − i 2 ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ K ˆO(x, x; τ ). (17.67) Here we have used Eqs. (16.47) and (17.52) (see also Eqs. (17.38), (17.49), (17.55) and (17.56)). From Eqs. (17.62) and (17.67) we see that we can determine the one loop Green’s function of the theory as well as the one loop eﬀective action if we know the heat kernel K ˆO(x, x′; τ ) of the theory. Some comments are in order here. We have used the Minkowski space form of the generating functional in Eq. (17.66). However, if the positivity requirement for the operator ˆO needs to analytically continue it to the Euclidean space, that can also be done without any problem. We will next illustrate these ideas with some simple examples which will also make some aspects of this formulation more clear. January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 459 17.3 Heat kernel method 449 17.3.1 Bosonic propagator in ﬂat space-time We have already calculated the bosonic propagator in ﬂat space-time using the proper time method in Section 16.1. Herewewill rederive the results using the heat kernel in two diﬀerent ways to stress some of the aspects of this method. In ﬂat space-time, gμν = ημν, |g| = 1 so that the operator O(x) in Eq. (17.60) takes the simple form O(x)= −(□ + m2). This oper- ator is not positive deﬁnite and there are two ways we can proceed. We can either analytically continue the operator in Eq. (17.52) (and Eq. (17.61)) to the Euclidean space as (see, for example, Eq. (4.9) or Eq. (8.5) or Eq. (16.41)) O(x) → OE(xE)=(−□E + m2), (17.68) and at the end of the calculations rotate back to Minkowski space. Or the alternative is to let τ → ¯τ = iτ, O(x) → (O(x)+ iϵ), (17.69) in Eq. (17.52) (and Eq. (17.61)), where it is understood that ϵ → 0+ at the end as in Eq. (16.5). Here, we will rotate the operator to the Euclidean space as in Eq. (17.68) and rotate back the re- sults to Minkowski space at the end. (Afterwards, we will evaluate the heat kernel also doing the analytic continuation as described in Eq. (17.69).) The operator OE(xE) is a positive operator and the nor- malized eigenfunctions of this operator are the plane waves, namely, OE(xE)ψkE (xE)= λkE ψkE (xE), (17.70) with ψkE (xE)= ⟨xE|kE⟩ = e−ikE ·xE (2π) D 2 ,λkE =(k2 E + m 2) > 0. (17.71) Following Eq. (17.52), we now obtain K ˆOE (xE,x′ E; τ )= ∫ dDkE ⟨xE|kE⟩⟨kE|e−τOE (xE )|x′ E⟩ = ∫ dDkE ψkE (xE)ψ∗ kE (x′ E)e−τλkE , (17.72) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 460 450 17 Zeta function regularization and this leads to (see Eq. (17.62)) GE(xE − x′ E)= ∫ ∞ 0 dτ ∫ dDkE ψkE (xE)ψ∗ kE (x′ E)e−τλkE = ∫ dDkE ψkE (xE)ψ∗ kE (x′ E) λkE = ∫ dDkE ψkE (xE)ψ∗ kE (x′ E) k2 E + m2 , (17.73) which describes the spectral resolution of the heat kernel (see also Eq. (17.58)). It is straightforward to check from the spectral decom- position in Eq. (17.74) (using Eq. (17.70) and the completeness of the eigenfunctions) that OE(xE)GE(xE − x′ E)= δD(xE − x′ E). (17.74) The heat kernel, in the present simple case, can be exactly eval- uated (substituting the eigenfunctions ψkE (x) and the eigenvalues λkE into Eq. (17.71) in Eq. (17.72)) K ˆOE (xE,x′ E; τ )= ∫ dDkE (2π)D e−ikE ·(xE −x′ E ) e−τ (k2 E +m2) = e−τm2− (xE −x′ E )2 4τ (2π)D ∫ dD˜kE e−τ ˜k2 E = e−τm2− (xE −x′ E )2 4τ (2π)D ( π τ ) D 2 = e−τm2− (xE −x′ E )2 4τ (4πτ ) D 2 , (17.75) which can be compared with Eq. (16.34) with appropriate analytic continuation. It follows from Eq. (16.25) that K(xE,x′ E; τ ) τ →0 −−−→ δD(xE − x′ E), (17.76) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 461 17.3 Heat kernel method 451 as it should (see Eq. (17.54)). Furthermore, it can be checked in a straightforward manner now that Eq. (17.53) holds, namely, ∂τ K ˆOE (xE − x′ E; τ )= − ˆOE(x)K ˆOE (xE − x′ E; τ ). (17.77) The Green’s function can also be exactly evaluated in this simple case as (see Eq. (17.62)) GE(xE − x′ E)= ∫ ∞ 0 dτK ˆOE (x − x′; τ ) = ∫ ∞ 0 dτ e−τm2− (xE −x′ E )2 4τ (4πτ ) D 2 , (17.78) which can be evaluated in terms of (modiﬁed) Bessel functions (see, for example, Eqs. (16.35)–(16.36)). We will now evaluate the heat kernel by analytically continuing the τ parameter as discussed in Eq. (17.69) for later use. Under the analytic continuation, the heat kernel associated with O(x)= −(□ + m2)isdeﬁnedas(we arerenaming ¯τ in Eq. (17.69) as τ for simplicity) K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= ⟨x|eiτ ˆO|x′⟩, (17.79) where the iϵ prescription is understood and this can be compared with Eq. (16.18). This heat kernel satisﬁes the equation ∂τ K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= i⟨x| ˆOeiτ ˆO|x′⟩ = iO(x)K ˆO(x, x′; τ ), (17.80) which can be compared with Eq. (16.19). The constant term in the operator O(x)= −(□ + m2) can be factored out by redeﬁning K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= e−im2τ ˜K−□(x, x′; τ ), (17.81) which leads to the equation (see Eq. (17.80)) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 462 452 17 Zeta function regularization ∂τ ˜K−□(x, x′; τ )= −i□ ˜K−□(x, x′; τ ) = −i∂μ∂μ ˜K−□(x, x′; τ ). (17.82) Equation (17.82) simply corresponds to the quantum mechanical free particle equation in D dimensional (Minkowski) space so that we can write the wave packet solution as K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= ⟨x, τ |x′, 0⟩ = e−im2τ ˜K−□(x, x′; τ ) = i (4πiτ ) D 2 e−im2τ − i(x−x′)2 4τ . (17.83) Here the constant i ( −i 4π ) D 2 has been ﬁxed from the initial condition in Eq. (17.54) (see also Eq. (16.32)) and Eq. (17.83) can be compared with Eq. (16.34). Furthermore, this leads to the Green’s function as (see Eqs. (17.61)–(17.62) with appropriate analytic continuation) G(x − x′)= −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτK ˆO(x, x′; τ ) = 1 (4πi) D 2 ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ D 2 e−im2τ − i(x−x′)2 4τ , (17.84) which coincides with Eq. (16.35) (remember Eq. (17.81) as well as the iϵ prescription that is understood). We will see in the next section how such a form becomes useful in the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel. To conclude this discussion, let us deﬁne a parameter related to the geodesic distance between the two coordinates (remember, we are in ﬂat space-time, otherwise we have to consider the geodetic interval or the world function) as σ(x, x′)= 1 2 (x − x′)2,σ(x, x′)∣ ∣x′=x =0, ∂σ(x, x′) ∂xμ =(x − x′)μ, ∂2σ(x, x′) ∂xμ∂xν = ημν,ημν ∂2σ(x, x′) ∂xμ∂xν = D, ημν ∂σ(x, x′) ∂xμ ∂σ(x, x′) ∂xν =2σ(x, x′). (17.85) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 463 17.4 Expansion of the heat kernel 453 In terms of this new variable, the operator O(x) takes the form O(x)= −(□ + m2)= − (2σ ∂2 ∂σ2 + D ∂ ∂σ + m 2) , (17.86) and the solutions in Eqs. (17.83) and (17.84) can be rewritten in terms of the variable σ(x, x′)as K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= i (4πiτ ) D 2 e−im2τ − iσ(x,x′) 2τ , G(x − x′)= 1 (4πi) D 2 ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ D 2 e−im2τ − iσ(x,x′) 2τ . (17.87) 17.4 Expansion of the heat kernel In the last section, we studied the heat kernel as well as the Green’s function for a free scalar ﬁeld theory in ﬂat space-time which can be worked out explicitly (in closed form). However, if a theory is in a curved background or in the background of interacting external sources, we may no longer be able to determine the heat kernel ex- actly. In this case, we can write a general solution of the heat kernel as a power series expansion in τ as (in D dimensions) K ˆO(x, x′; τ )= iΔ 1 2 (x, x′) (4πiτ ) D 2 e−im2τ − iσ(x,x′) 2τ F (x, x′; τ ), F (x, x′; τ )= ∞∑ n=0 an(x, x′)(iτ )n, (17.88) where Δ(x, x′)= |g(x)|− 1 2 | det ∂x μ∂x′ ν σ(x, x′)||g(x′)|− 1 2 , (17.89) is known as the biscalar Van Vleck-Morette determinant. σ(x, x′) here is one half of the length of the proper interval (geodesic length) squared along the geodesic between the points x and x′,namely, January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 464 454 17 Zeta function regularization σ(x, x′)= 1 2 ℓ2(x, x′). (17.90) (Normally, the proper interval is denoted by τ or s both of which we are using in other contexts and, therefore, we denote the invariant length as ℓ. Furthermore, we assume that there is only one geodesic between the two points x, x′. If there are more geodesics, then, the contributions from all of them need to be summed.) The important thing to note from Eq. (17.88) is that the coeﬃcients of expansion an(x, x′) depend only on the coordinates and not on τ .They also do not depend on the dimensionality of space-time. Furthermore, the initial condition on the heat kernel, Eq. (17.54), leads to a0(x, x′)=1, (17.91) and we can also derive the covariantized relations (see Eq. (17.85)) gμν ∂σ ∂xμ ∂σ ∂xν =(Dμσ)(Dμσ)=2σ, Δ−1Dμ(ΔDμσ)= D. (17.92) Since the coordinate and τ dependencies are explicitly separated out in the expansion Eq. (17.88), we can now go back to the heat equation (see the Minkowski space equation, Eq. (17.80)) and the two sides of the equation lead to ∂τ K ˆO = ∞∑ n=0 iΔ 1 2 e−im2τ − iσ 2τ (4πiτ ) D 2 × [( iσ 2τ 2 − D 2τ − im2) an + i(n +1)an+1 ] (iτ )n, iO(x)K ˆO = i ∞∑ n=0 O(x) ( iΔ 1 2 e−im2τ − iσ 2τ an (4πiτ ) D 2 ) (iτ )n. (17.93) Here we have suppressed the coordinate dependence in various terms for simplicity. The right hand side of the second relation in Eq. (17.93) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 465 17.4 Expansion of the heat kernel 455 depends explicitly on the exact form of O(x) and once a form is speciﬁed (by the theory), equating the two relations in Eq. (17.92) (see Eq. (17.80)) would generate a recursion relation between the coeﬃcients an(x, x′) (depending on the form of O(x)) which can be solved. Let us illustrate this with a general form of the operator O(x). Consider an operator of the form (compare with Eq. (17.60)) O(x)= −(□ + m2 + V )= −(DμDμ + m2 + V ), (17.94) where Dμ denotes the gravitational covariant derivative and V rep- resents a potential term (which does not involve derivatives). Such an operator may arise, say from the Lagrangian of a charged particle (bosonic/fermionic) in a gravitational background interacting with an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. In this case, the second relation in Eq. (17.93) can be worked out to give iO(x)K ˆO = ∞∑ n=0 iΔ 1 2 e−im2τ − iσ 2τ (4πiτ ) D 2 × [( iDμσDμσ 4τ 2 − Δ−1Dμ(ΔDμσ) 2τ − i(m2 + V ))an − iΔ− 1 2DμDμ(Δ 1 2 an)− i(Dμσ)(Dμan+1)](iτ )n. (17.95) It is now straightforward to compare the ﬁrst relation in Eq. (17.93) with Eq. (17.95). The −im2 terms cancel on both sides of Eq. (17.80). The 1 τ 2 terms cancel because of the ﬁrst identity in Eq. (17.92). The 1 τ terms cancel because of the second identity in Eq. (17.92). Compar- ing the coeﬃcients of (iτ )n terms on both sides of Eq. (17.80), we ob- tain the recursion relation (recall from Eq. (17.91) that a0(x, x′)=1) (n +1)an+1 +(Dμσ)(Dμan+1) = −Van − Δ− 1 2 DμDμ(Δ 1 2 an),n =0, 1, 2, ··· . (17.96) We emphasize here that, while V = V (x), other variables depend on two coordinates, namely, σ = σ(x, x′), Δ = Δ(x, x′), an = an(x, x′) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 466 456 17 Zeta function regularization and we have suppressed these coordinate dependencies for simplicity. Once, we have determined the coeﬃcients an(x, x′), we can substitute them into Eq. (17.88) to determine the heat kernel K ˆO(x, x′; τ )which can give, for example, the Green’s function of the theory. On the other hand, if we are interested in the eﬀective action of the theory, that depends only on the trace of the heat kernel and, therefore, on the heat kernel in the coincidence limit K ˆO(x, x; τ ) (see, for example, Eq. (17.67)). The recursion relation in Eq. (17.96) becomes much simpler in the coincidence limit. We note that when x′ → x, we can write (see Eq. (17.90)) σ(x, x′)= 1 2 dℓ2 = 1 2 gμν(x)dxμdxν, (17.97) where dxμ =(x′ − x)μ denotes the inﬁnitesimal interval as x′ → x. Therefore, it follows immediately that in the coincidence limit (x′ = x corresponds to dxμ =0) σ(x, x′)∣ ∣x′=x =0,Dμσ(x, x′)∣ ∣x′=x = gμν(x)dxν∣ ∣dx=0 =0, ∂σ(x, x′) ∂xμ∂xν ∣ ∣x′=x = gμν(x), Δ(x, x′)∣ ∣x′=x =1, (17.98) and so on. In fact, taking successive derivatives of the two relations in Eq. (17.92) one can derive many more such useful relations in the coincident limit. In particular, we have Dμ(Δ 1 2 (x, x′))∣ ∣x′=x =0,DμDν(Δ 1 2 (x, x′))∣ ∣x′=x = 1 6 Rμν, (17.99) where Rμν denotes the Riemann curvature tensor of the manifold. As a result, the recursion relation in Eq. (17.96) simpliﬁes in this limit to (n +1)an+1(x)= −Van(x) − DμDμ(Δ 1 2 (x, x′)an(x, x′))∣ ∣x′=x, (17.100) where n =0, 1, 2, ··· andwehaveidentiﬁed an(x, x′)|x′=x = an(x). Recalling that a0(x) = 1 (see Eq. (17.91)), it follows now that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 467 17.4 Expansion of the heat kernel 457 a0(x)=1,a1(x)= − 1 6 gμνRμν −V = − 1 6 R−V, ··· , (17.101) where R stands for the Ricci scalar curvature. Therefore, in the coincident limit, we can write K ˆO(x, x; τ )= ie−im2τ (4πiτ ) D 2 ∞∑ n=0 an(x)(iτ )n, (17.102) where the coeﬃcients an(x) are determined from the recursion rela- tion Eq. (17.100). In evaluating the eﬀective action, Eq. (17.67), the basic quantity of interest is −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ K ˆO(x, x; τ )=(4π)− D 2 ∞∑ n=0(i)n− D 2 an(x) × ∫ ∞ 0 dτ (τ )n− D 2 −1 e−im2τ . (17.103) Recalling that there is an imaginary part in the mass term (namely, m2 → m2 − iϵ), the integral over τ in Eq. (17.103) can be done trivially and gives ∫ ∞ 0 dτ (τ )n− D 2 −1 e−im2τ = 1 (im2)n− D 2 Γ (n − D 2 ) , (17.104) so that we have (see Eqs. (17.103) and (17.104)) −i ∫ ∞ 0 dτ τ K ˆO(x, x; τ )= ∞∑ n=0 Γ(n − D 2 ) (m2)n− D 2 an(x) (4π) D 2 . (17.105) As a result, the (subtracted or normalized) eﬀective action for the theory (see Eqs. (17.67) and (16.85)) is obtained to be (the ﬁeld independent a0(x) term cancels out) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 468 458 17 Zeta function regularization W [gμν]= 1 2 ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 ∞∑ n=1 Γ(n − D 2 ) (m2)n− D 2 an(x) (4π) D 2 . (17.106) There are several things to note from this result. First, we have continued to denote the normalized eﬀective action as W and not Γ to avoid confusion with the gamma functions. We note that for odd D dimensions, the gamma function is well behaved and, therefore, there are no divergences in the eﬀective action in odd space-time dimensions. For even space-time dimensions (D even), on the other hand, the gamma function diverges for n − D 2 ≤ 0. Consequently, there are divergent terms in the eﬀective action which can be thought of as renormalization parts which need to be removed by adding counter terms to the starting theory. For a given D,suchdivergent terms are ﬁnite in number and, consequently, the number of counter terms needed is also ﬁnite. Using the gamma function recursion relation Γ(s +1) = sΓ(s) repeatedly, it can be shown that Γ(s)= 1 s(s +1)(s +2) ··· (s + k − 1) Γ(s + k), (17.107) which leads to Γ(−k)= (−1)k k! 1 s + k ∣ ∣ ∣s→−k, (17.108) and shows that all the divergent terms in Eq. (17.106) have simple pole structures. For n − D 2 ≥ 1, the terms in the eﬀective action in Eq. (17.106) are ﬁnite and give the quantum corrections to the the- ory. Symbolically, we can see that the zeta function regularization naturally divides the eﬀective action into a divergent renormalization part and a ﬁnite part which represents the genuine quantum correc- tions (we remind the readers that the normalized eﬀective action which vanishes when external backgrounds are set to zero is denoted by Γ[gμν, ··· ], see Eq. (16.85)) W [gμν]= Wdiv[gμν]+ Wﬁnite[gμν]. (17.109) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 469 17.4 Expansion of the heat kernel 459 We note from Eq. (17.106) that the eﬀective action, in this mas- sive case, is an expansion in inverse powers of the mass parameter. Therefore, it does not allow us to take the massless limit directly. If the theory under consideration involves massless particles, the cal- culation of the eﬀective action proceeds as follows. In evaluating Eq. (17.104) (with m = 0), we note that since the operator ˆO in the exponent has an imaginary part (remember m2 − iϵ), largevaluesof τ will be damped out and the singularities as well as the dominant contributions will come only from small values of τ . Therefore, we can divide the τ integral into two parts at some ﬁnite small value τ0 and write ∫ ∞ 0 dττ s+n− D 2 = ∫ τ0 0 dττ s+n− D 2 + ∫ ∞ τ0 dττ s+n− D 2 . (17.110) As a result, for Re s> D 2 , we can write (see Eqs. (17.56) and (17.102) with m =0) ζ ˆO(s, x)= ∞∑ n=0 (i)n+1− D 2 (4π) D 2 an(x) 1 Γ(s) ∫ τ0 0 dττ s+n− D 2 −1 = ∞∑ n=0 (i)n+1− D 2 (4π) D 2 an(x) 1 Γ(s) τ s+n− D 2 0 s + n − D 2 , (17.111) where the integral vanishes at the lower limit for Re s> D 2 (and the second integral is assumed to be damped). There is only a pole singularity in Eq. (17.111) and we can now analytically continue this result to Re s< D 2 as well. Furthermore, using Eq. (17.108), we note that in even dimensions (D even) ζ ˆO(−m, x) = lim s→−m ∞∑ n=0 (i)n+1− D 2 (4π) D 2 (−1)m m! × (s + m) τ s+n− D 2 0 s + n − D 2 an(x) = i(−i)m m! (4π) D 2 am+ D 2 (x). (17.112) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 470 460 17 Zeta function regularization As is clear from the second line of Eq. (17.112), ζ ˆO(−m, x) vanishes in odd dimensions (D odd) since (s + m) s→−m −−−−→ 0and thereisno pole term to cancel this. Equation (17.112) leads, in particular to ζ ˆO(0,x)= i (4π) D 2 a D 2 (x), (17.113) which, as we will see in the next section, is very useful in the calcu- lation of anomalies. This also leads to (see Eq. (17.55)) ζ ˆO(0) = ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 ζ ˆO(0,x) = i (4π) D 2 ∫ dDx |g(x)| 1 2 a D 2 (x). (17.114) We note here that we can also calculate ζ ′(0) from Eq. (17.112) which, as we have seen, leads to the eﬀective action, but the calculation is not as simple. 17.5 Schwinger model in curved space-time As an application of the zeta function regularization, let us study the Schwinger model in a curved space-time background. As we have discussed in great detail in Section 13.2, Schwinger model describes massless QED (quantum electrodynamics) in 1 + 1 dimensions. In ﬂat space-time, the Lagrangian density is given by (see Eq. (13.43)) L = − 1 4 FμνF μν + i ¯ψημνγν(∂μ + ieAμ)ψ, μ, ν =0, 1, (17.115) leading to the action S = ∫ d2x L. (17.116) The properties of the Dirac gamma matrices are described in Eqs. (13.48)–(13.51) and a representation for these 2 × 2 matrices January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 471 17.5 Schwinger model in curved space-time 461 is given by the Pauli matrices in Eq. (13.52). Various identities asso- ciated with these two dimensional matrices are discussed in Eqs. (13.57)–(13.62). Let us next look at only the fermion part of the theory. In a curved space-time manifold, of course, the metric ημν → gμν(x), but since the fermions are deﬁned only in the tangent space (to the manifold), the part of the Lagrangian density involving the fermions is given by (e denotes the electric charge which has the dimension of mass, see Eq. (13.47)) Lf = i ¯ψeμa(x)γaDμψ = i ¯ψeμa(x)γa(Dμ + ieAμ)ψ, (17.117) with the action given by Sf = ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 Lf . (17.118) We note that, in Eq. (17.117), μ =0, 1and a =0, 1. Here the indices a, b, ··· are the tangent space (world) indices while μ, ν, ··· denote the indices of the Riemannian manifold. eμa(x) denotes the transformation matrix between the world vectors and the vectors on the Riemannian manifold and, in two dimensions, is known as the zweibein (in four dimensions it is known as the vierbein or is also known as the tetrad). The Riemannian indices are raised or lowered by the gravitational metric while the world indices are raised and lowered by the (ﬂat space) Minkowski metric. The zweibeins satisfy various relations of the forms (repeated indices are summed) eμaeν a = gμν,eμaeb μ = ηab,eμaeνa = δμ ν ,eμaeμb = δa b . (17.119) Dμ, in Eq. (17.117), denotes the gravitational covariant derivative and acting on spinors, it has the form Dμψ = (∂μ + 1 2 ωμabσab) ψ, (17.120) where ωμab is known as the spin connection and is deﬁned in terms of the zweibein as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 472 462 17 Zeta function regularization ωμab = 1 2 [eν a(∂μeνb − ∂νeμb)+ eρ aeσ b (∂σeρc)ec μ − (a ↔ b)], (17.121) and (see also Eqs. (13.58) and (13.59)) σab = 1 2 [γa,γb]= ϵabγ5. (17.122) Although the Dirac matrices in ﬂat space-time are constant matrices, in curved space-time they become space-time dependent, γμ(x)= eμ a (x)γa (nonetheless, γ5 does not change). As a result, the gamma matrix decomposition, Eq. (13.60), takes the form (recall that the contravariant Levi-Civita tensor transforms under a general coordi- nate transformation as a tensor density of weight −1 while the co- variant (Levi-Civita) tensor transforms as a tensor density of weight +1) γμγν = gμν + 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνγ5, (17.123) and we have D/ 2 = γμγνDμDν = DμDμ + 1 2|g(x)| 1 2 γ5 ϵμν [Dμ, Dν] = DμDμ + ie 2|g(x)| 1 2 γ5ϵμν Fμν. (17.124) The fermion part of the generating functional can be written as Zf [A]= eiWf [A] = ∫ D ¯ψDψeiSf , (17.125) with Sf given in Eq. (17.118). If we now make an inﬁnitesimal local chiral transformation (see Eq. (13.125)) of the fermion ﬁelds ψ(x) → ψ′(x)= ψ(x) − ieϵ(x)γ5ψ(x), ¯ψ(x) → ¯ψ′(x)= ¯ψ(x) − ieϵ(x) ¯ψ(x)γ5, (17.126) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 473 17.5 Schwinger model in curved space-time 463 where ϵ(x) is the inﬁnitesimal local parameter of transformation, the fermion Lagrangian density changes as Lf →Lf − e(∂μϵ(x)) ¯ψγ5γμψ, (17.127) leading to Sf → Sf − ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 (∂μϵ(x))J μ 5 (x) = Sf + ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x) DμJ μ 5 (x), (17.128) where we note that (see Eqs. (13.63) and (13.64) in a curved back- ground) J μ(x)= e ¯ψ(x)γμψ(x),J μ 5 (x)= e ¯ψ(x)γ5γμψ(x), J μ 5 (x)= 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνJν(x). (17.129) Furthermore, we have integrated by parts in the second line of Eq. (17.128) discarding a surface term and have used the fact that DμJ μ 5 (x)= 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ∂μ(|g(x)| 1 2 J μ 5 (x)). (17.130) The generating functional in Eq. (17.125) does not change under a ﬁeld redeﬁnition (since the path integral is an integral over all ﬁeld conﬁgurations). Therefore, if there were no other contributions in the path integral coming from the ﬁeld redeﬁnition in Eq. (17.126), we would conclude that δZf [A]= ∫ D ¯ψDψ (iδSf ) eiSf =0, or,Dμ⟨J μ 5 (x)⟩ = − 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνDμ δWf [A] δAν(x) =0, (17.131) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 474 464 17 Zeta function regularization where we have used Eq. (17.129). This simply expresses the covari- antized form of the chiral curent conservation for a massless fermion (see Eq. (13.8)). On the other hand, we know (see Chapter 13) that the path in- tegral measure is not invariant under a chiral transformation, Eq. (17.126), of the fermion ﬁelds. In Chapter 13, we had calculated the change in the measure in the momentum space in a regularized manner. Here we will calculate the same using zeta function regular- ization. (The momentum space calculation can also be done here by using Riemann normal coordinates.) Let us consider the eigenvalue equation iD/φn = λnφn, (iD/ )2φn = −D/ 2φn = λ2 nφn, (17.132) so that the zeta function associated with this operator can be deﬁned as (see the spectral resolution of the zeta function in Eq. (17.58)) ζ−D/ 2(s, x)= ∑ n φn(x)φ† n(x) (λ2 n)s . (17.133) We can expand the fermion ﬁelds (see, for example, Eqs. (13.17)– (13.25) as well as Eq. (17.126)) in these basis functions as ψ(x)= ∑ n anφn(x),ψ′(x)= ∑ n,m cnmamφn(x), ¯ψ(x)= ∑ n bnφ† n(x), ¯ψ′(x)= ∑ n,m cnmbmφ† n(x), (17.134) where (see Eq. (13.22) with λ(x)= eϵ(x)) cnm = δnm − ie ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x)φ† n(x)γ5φm(x). (17.135) As a result, the path integral measures can be written as January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 475 17.5 Schwinger model in curved space-time 465 Dψ = ∏ n dan, D ¯ψ = ∏ n dbn, Dψ′ =(det cnm)−1 ∏ n dan =(det cnm)−1Dψ, D ¯ψ′ =(det cnm)−1 ∏ n dbn =(det cnm)−1D ¯ψ, (17.136) where the inverse of the determinant arises because we are dealing with fermion ﬁelds (see Eqs. (5.30) and (5.32)). We see that the basic element in the study of the change in the path integral measure is (see Eq. (17.135)) det cnm =det (δnm − ie ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x) φ† n(x)γ5φm(x)) = exp Tr ln (δnm − ie ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x) φ† n(x)γ5φm(x)) =exp (−ie ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x)tr(γ5φn(x)φ† n(x))) =exp (−ie ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x)tr(γ5ζ−D/ 2(0,x))) . (17.137) Here we have used Eqs. (17.133) as well as (17.135) and “tr” stands for trace over Dirac (spinor) indices. As a result, the change in the path integral measure takes the form δ (D ¯ψDψ) = D ¯ψ′Dψ′ −D ¯ψDψ = D ¯ψDψ((det cnm)−2 − 1) = D ¯ψDψ (2ie ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x)tr(γ5ζ−D/ 2(0,x))) = D ¯ψDψ (2ie ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x)tr (γ5 ia1(x) 4π )) = D ¯ψDψ (− e 2π ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x)tr(γ5a1(x))) , (17.138) where we have used Eq. (17.113) for D = 2. Adding this contribution from the change in the path integral measure to Eq. (17.131), we obtain January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 476 466 17 Zeta function regularization δZf [A]= ∫ D ¯ψDψ ( − e 2π ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ϵ(x)tr(γ5a1(x)) + iδSf ) eiSf =0, or,Dμ⟨J μ 5 (x)⟩− e 2iπ tr(γ5a1(x)) = 0. (17.139) Here we have used the form of δSf from Eq. (17.128). Compared with Eq. (17.131), we note that the change in the path integral measure leads to an anomaly in the conservation of the chiral current. The coeﬃcient a1(x) in the heat kernel expansion (for the oper- ator −D/ 2) is already known (in fact, see Eqs. (17.101) and (17.124)) and has the form a1(x)= − 1 6 R + ··· − ie 2|g(x)| 1 2 γ5ϵμνFμν, (17.140) where ··· above denote terms without any γ5.Since tr γ5 = 0 and tr γ2 5 =tr \u0000 = 2 (see Eqs. (13.51) and (13.52)), substituting the form of a1(x) from Eq. (17.140) into Eq. (17.139) we obtain Dμ⟨J μ 5 (x)⟩ = e 2iπ × 2 × (−ie) 2|g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνFμν = − e2 2π 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνFμν, or,ϵμνDμ δWf [A] δAν(x) = e2 2π ϵμνFμν, (17.141) which can be integrated to determine the eﬀective action for the photon (coming from the fermion integral) to be (we are suppressing coordinate dependencies for simplicity) Wf [A]= e2 8π ∫ d2x |g| 1 2 1 |g| 1 2 ϵλρFλρ 1 D2 1 |g| 1 2 ϵστ Fστ . (17.142) January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 477 17.5 Schwinger model in curved space-time 467 Here, in the denominator, D2 = DμDμ and the form of this eﬀective action can be easily checked as follows. We note from Eq. (17.142) that δWf [A] δAν(x) = − e2 2π 1 |g| 1 2 ϵλρgρν Dλ 1 D2 1 |g| 1 2 ϵστ Fστ , (17.143) which leads to ϵμνDμ δWf [A] δAν(x) = − e2 2π 1 |g| 1 2 ϵμνϵλρgρν DμDλ 1 D2 1 |g| 1 2 ϵστ Fστ . (17.144) If we use the Levi-Civita tensor decomposition (in curved space) 1 |g| ϵμνϵλρ = −gμλgνρ + gμρgνλ, (17.145) Eq. (17.144) yields ϵμνDμ δWf [A] δAν(x) = e2 2π |g| 1 2 D2 1 D2 1 |g| 1 2 ϵστ Fστ = e2 2π ϵμνFμν, (17.146) which coincides with Eq. (17.141). The eﬀective action in Eq. (17.142) is recognized to be the covariantized form of Eq. (13.107) (with- out the photon kinetic energy term) and shows that the photon has become massive with a mass m2 ph = e2 π as was also seen in Eq. (13.104) in the ﬂat space-time case. This is better seen in the gauge DμAμ(x) = 0 where the photon ﬁeld can be written as Aμ = |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνDνη(x),A μ = 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνDνη(x). (17.147) In this gauge, it follows that January 21, 2019 17:13 ws-book9x6 Book Title 11339-shrink page 478 468 17 Zeta function regularization 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνDμAν(x)= 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμν|g(x)| 1 2 ϵνλDμDλη(x) = DμDμη(x)= D2η(x), (17.148) so that we can write Eq. (17.142) as Wf [A]= e2 2π ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνDμAν 1 D2 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵλρDλAρ = e2 2π ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵμνDμAν 1 D2 D2η = e2 2π ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 Aν(x) 1 |g(x)| 1 2 ϵνμDμη(x) = e2 2π ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 Aμ(x)Aμ(x), (17.149) where we have used Eq. (17.147) in the last step. Adding the photon kinetic energy term to this, the total eﬀective action for the photon at one loop can be written as Wtot[A]= ∫ d2x |g(x)| 1 2 ( − 1 4 FμνF μν + m2 ph 2 AμAμ) , (17.150) where m2 ph = e2 π . The photon continues to be massive in the presence of gravitation which does not change the quantitative behavior of the theory including the chiral anomaly (other than covariantizing the ﬂat space-time results). We conclude this discussion by noting that all of this analysis of the eﬀective action for the photon can also be done by making a ﬁnite chiral transformation which will decouple the photon ﬁeld from the fermions as done in Chapter 13. However,wehavedoneit diﬀerently here (by integrating the anomaly equation) only to bring out alternative ways of deriving the eﬀective action as also discussed in Section 16.3.2 where we have calculated the eﬀective action at ﬁnite temperature.
