True, because the outcomes inside B maintain the same relative proportions as in the original probability law. 2. False. Outcomes in €2 that are outside B have zero conditional probability, s0 it cannot be the case that all outcomes in {2 have the same conditional probability.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
