No, they are dependent v| X Answer: Yes, they are independent Solution: Yes, because P (ANQ) =P (4) =P (4)-1=P (4)-P(Q). Intuitively, P (A) represents our beliefs about the likelihood that A will occur. If we are told that £ occurred, this does not give us any new information; we already knew that €2 is certain to occur. For this reason, P(A|Q)=P(A).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
