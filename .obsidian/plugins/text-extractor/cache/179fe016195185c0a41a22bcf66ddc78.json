We use the estimator ©, with ® = 1if X > 0and © = —1 otherwise. (This is actually the MAP estimator for this problem.) a) Let us assume that the true value of © is 1. In this case, our estimator makes an error if and only if W has a low (negative) value. The conditional probability of error given the true value of © is 1, that s, P(B#1]6=1),isequalto Oa(-1) @20 O a(1) where @ is the standard normal CDF. b) For this problem, the overall probability of error is easiest found using the formula 9 8 = 6] =z) fx (z) dz OpP@®B+#£0)=[P®O#06|X d ©P@®+£6)=5,PO#00=06)p0(0) v Solution: a) We have P@B£1]0=1) =PO+W<0|0=1)=P1+W<0]|0=1) = P(L+W<0)=P(W<-1)=2a(-1). b) Similar to part (a), P (é # 0| B = 6) is easy to calculate for either choice of § = —1 or @ = 1. For this reason, the second formula is easy to implement.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
