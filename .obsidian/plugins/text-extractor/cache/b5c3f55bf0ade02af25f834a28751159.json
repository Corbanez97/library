{"path":"Notes/Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data/images/exercises/L04E3.png","text":"We start with a pool of n people. A chaired committee consists of k > 1 members, out of whom one member is designated as the chairperson. The expression k(z) can be interpreted as the number of possible chaired committees with k members. This is because we have (:) choices for the k members, and once the members are chosen, there are then k choices for the chairperson. Thus, S n c= k () is the total number of possible chaired committees of any size. Find the value of ¢ (as a function of 1) by thinking about a different way of forming a chaired committee: first choose the chairperson, then choose the other members of the committee. The answer is of the form c=(a+mnf)2m+. What are the values of &, 3,7, and 82 Solution: We first choose the chairperson, for which there are 7 choices, and then choose an arbitrary subset of the remaining n — 1 people, who will be the remaining committee members. For example, this arbitrary subset could be the empty set, which would mean that the committee is of size 1: only the chairperson. There are on 1 possible subsets of a set with m — 1 elements, and so there are 2\" B ways of choosing the remaining committee members. Thus, an alternative expression for the number of possible chaired committees of any size is n2™ 1, from which we can extract the values of e, 3, 7, and 4J.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
