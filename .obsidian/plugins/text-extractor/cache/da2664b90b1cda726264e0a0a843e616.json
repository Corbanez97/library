The publica- tion in this journal of this translation was approved by Dr. Szilard before he died, but he never saw the copy. At Mrs. Szilard’s request, Dr. Carl Eckart revised the translation. This is one of the earliest, if not the earliest paper, in which the relations of physical entropy to information (in the sense of modem mathematical theory of communication) were rigorously demonstrated and in which Max- well’s famous demon was successfully exorcised: a milestone in the integra- tion of physical and cognitive concepts. ON THE DECREASE OF ENTROPY IN A THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEM BY THE INTERVENTION OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS by Leo Szilard Translated by Anatol Rapoport and Mechthilde Knoller from the original article “Uber die Entropiever- minderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen.” Zeitschrift fur Physik, 1929, 65, 840-866. 0*3 The objective of the investigation is to find the conditions which apparently allow the construction of a perpetual-motion ma- chine of the second kind, if one permits an intelligent being to intervene in a thermo- dynamic system. When such beings make measurements, they make the system behave in a manner distinctly different from the way a mechanical system behaves when left to itself. We show that it is a sort of a memory faculty, manifested by a system where measurements occur, that might cause a permanent decrease of entropy and thus a violation of the Second Law of Thermody- namics, were it not for the fact that the measurements themselves are necessarily accompanied by a production of entropy. At first we calculate this production of entropy quite generally from the postulate that full compensation is made in the sense of the Second Law (Equation [l]). Second, by using an inanimate device able to make measurements-however under continual entropy production-we shall calculate the Requests for reprints of this paper should be sent to: Mrs. Leo Szilard 2380 Torrey Pines Road La Jolla, California 92038 301 resulting quantity of entropy. We find that it is exactly as great as is necessary for full compensation. The actual production of entropy in connection with the measure- ment, therefore, need not be greater than Equation (1) requires. HERE is an objection, already historical, T against the universal validity of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which in- deed looks rather ominous. The objection is embodied in the notion of Maxwell’s demon, who in a different form appears even nowa- days again and again; perhaps not unreason- ably, inasmuch as behind the precisely formulated question quantitative connec- tions seem to be hidden which to date have not been clarified. The objection in its origi- nal formulation concerns a demon who catches the fast molecules and lets the slow ones pass. To be sure, the objection can be met with the reply that man cannot in prin- ciple foresee the value of a thermally fluc- tuating parameter. However, one cannot deny that we can very well measure the value of such a fluctuating parameter and therefore could certainly gain energy at the expense of heat by arranging our interven- F(J 302 LEO SZILAHI) tiori according to the results of the ineasure- nients. Presently, of course, we do not know whether we commit an error by not includ- ing the intervening man into the system and by disregarding his biological phenomena. Apart froin this unresolved matter, it is known today that in a system left to itself no “perpetuuni mobile’’ (perpetual niotion ma- chine) of the second kind (more exactly, no “automatic machine of continual finite work-yield which uses heat at the lowest temperature”) can operate in spite of the fluctuation phenomena. A perpetuuni mobile would have to be a machine which in the long run could lift a weight at the expense of thc heat content of a reservoir. In other words, if we want to use the fluctuation phe- noinena in order to gain energy at the ex- pense of heat, we are in the same position as playing a ganic of chance, in which we may win certain amounts now and then, although the expectation value of the winnings is zero or negat>ive. The same applies to a system where the intervention from outside is per- formed strictly periodically, say by periodi- cally moving machines. We consider this as established (Szilard, 1925) and intend here only to consider the difficulties that occur when intelligent beings intervene in a sys- tem. We shall try to discover the quantita- tive relations having to do with this inter- vention. Snioluchowski (1914, p. 89) writes: “As far as we know today, there is no automatic, permanently effective perpetual motion ma- chine, in spite of the molecular fluctuations, but such a device might, perhaps, function regularly if it were appropriately operated by intelligent beings.. . .” A perpetual motion machine therefore is possible if-according to the general method of physics-we view the experimenting man as a sort of deus ex machina, one who is con- tinuously and exactly informed of the exist- ing state of nature and who is able to start or interrupt the macroscopic course of nature at any rnornent without expenditure of work. Therefore he would definitely not have to possess the ability to catch single molecules like Maxwell’s demon, although he would definitely be different from real living beings in possessing the above abilities. In eliciting any physical effect by action of the sensory as well as the motor nervous systems a degradation of energy is always involved, quite apart from the fact that the very existence of a nervous system is dependent on continual dissipation of energy. Whether-considering these circuin- stances---real living beings could continually or at least regularly produce energy at the expense of heat of the lowest temperature ap- pears very doubtful, even though our ignor- ance of the biological phenomena does not allow a definite answer. However, the latter questions lead beyond the scope of physics in the strict sense. It appears that the ignorance of the bio- logical phenomena need not prevent us frorn understanding that which seems to us to be the essential thing. We may be sure that intelligent living beings-insofar as we are dealing with their intervention in a ther- niodynaniic systen-can be replaced by non- living devices whose “biological phenomena” one could follow and determine whether in fact a compensation of the entropy decrease takes place as a result of the intervention by such a device in a system. In the first place, we wish to learn what circumstance conditions the decrease of entropy which takcs place when intelligent living beings intervene in a therniodynamic system. We shall see that this depends on a certain type of coupling between different parameters of the system. We shall consider an unusually simple type of these ominous coup1ings.l For brevity we shall talk about a “measurement,” if we succeed in coupling the value of a parameter y (for instance the position co-ordinate of a pointer of a meas- uring instrument) at one nioment with the simultaneous value of a fluctuating parame- ter x of the system, in such a way that, from the value y, we can draw conclusions about the value that x had at the moment of the “measurement.” Then let x and y be un- coupled after the measurement, so that 5 can change, while y retains its value for some time. Such measurements are not harmless interventions. A system in which such measurements occur shows a sort of memory ’The author evidently uses the word “omi- nous” in the sense that the possibility of realizing the proposed arrangement threatens the validity of the Second Law.-Translator ON THE DECREASE OF ENTROPY 303 faculty, in the sense that one can recognize by the state parameter y what value another state parameter z had at an earlier moment, and we shall see that simply because of such a memory the Second Law would be vio- lated, if the measurement could take place without compensation. We shall realize that the Second Law is not threatened as much by this entropy decrease as one would think, as soon as we see that the entropy decrease resulting from the intervention would be compensated completely in any event if the execution of such a measurement were, for instance, always accompanied by produc- tion of k log 2 units of entropy. In that case it will be possible to find a more general entropy law, which applies universally to all measurements. Finally we shall consider a very simple (of course, not living) device, that is able to make measurements con- tinually and whose “biological phenomena” we can easily follow. By direct calculation, one finds in fact a continual entropy produc- tion of the magnitude required by the above- mentioned more general entropy law de- rived from the validity of the Second Law. The first example, which we are going to consider more closely as a typical one, is the following. A standing hollow cylinder, closed at both ends, can be separated into two possibly unequal sections of volumes V, and V, respectively by inserting a partition from the side at an arbitrarily fixed height. This partition forms a piston that can be moved up and down in the cylinder. An infinitely large heat reservoir of a given temperature T insures that any gas present in the cylinder undergoes isothermal expansion as the piston moves. This gas shall consist of a single molecule which, as long as the piston is not inserted into the cylinder, tumbles about in the whole cylinder by virtue of its thermal motion. Imagine, specifically, a man who at a given time inserts the piston into the cylinder and somehow notes whether the molecule is caught in the upper or lower part of the cyl- inder, that is, in volume V1 or V,. If he should find that the former is the case, then he would move the piston slowly downward until it reaches the bottom of the cylinder. During this slow movement of the piston the molecule stays, of course, above the piston. However, it is no longer constraincd to the upper part of the cylinder but bounces inany times against the piston which is already moving in the lower part of the cylinder. In this way the molecule does a certain amount of work on the piston. This is the work that corresponds to the isothermal expansion of an ideal gas--consisting of one single mole- cule-from volume V, to the volume V1 + V2 . After some time, when the piston has reached the bottom of the container, the molecule has again the full volume V1 + Vz to move about in, and the piston is then re- moved. The procedure can be repeated as many times as desired. The man moves the piston up or down depending on whether the molecule is trapped in the upper or lower half of the piston. In more detail, this motion may be caused by a weight, that is to be raised, through a mechanisni that transmits the force from the piston to the weight, in such a way that the latter is always dis- placed upwards. In this way the potential energy of the weight certainly increases constantly. (The transmission of force to the weight is best arranged so that the force exerted by the weight on the piston at any position of the latter equals the average pressure of the gas.) It is clear that in this manner energy is constantly gained at the expense of heat, insofar as the biological phenomena of the intervening nian are ig- nored in the calculation. In order to understand the essence of the man’s effect on the system, one best imagines that the movement of the piston is performed niechanically and that the man’s activity consists only in determining the altitude of the molecule and in pushing a lever (which steers the piston) to the right or left, depend- ing on whether the molecule’s height requires a down- or upward movement. This nieans that the intervention of the huniari being consists only in the coupling of two position co-ordinates, namely a co-ordinate x, which determines the altitude of the molecule, with another co-ordinate y, which determines the position of the lever and therefore also whether an upward or downward motion is imparted to the piston. It is best to imagine the mass of the piston as large and its speed sufficiently great, so that the thermal agita- 304 LEO SZILARD tion of the piston at the temperature in ques- tion can be neglected. In the typical example presented here, we wish to distinguish two periods, namely: 1. The period of measuTeinent when the piston has just been inserted in the middle of the cylinder and the niolecule is trapped either in the upper or lower part; so that if we choose the origin of co-ordinates appropri- ately, the r-co-ordinate of the molecule is restricted to either the interval x > 0 or x < 0; 2. The period of utilization of the measure- ment, “the period of decrease of entropy,” during which the piston is moving up or down. During this period the x-co-ordinate of the molecule is certainly not restricted to the original interval x > 0 or x < 0. Rather, if the molecule was in the upper half of the cylinder during the period of measurement, i.e., when x > 0, the molecule must bounce on the downward-moving piston in the lower part of the cylinder, if it is to transmit energy to the piston; that is, the co-ordinate R: has to enter the interval x < 0. The lever, on the contrary, retains during the whole pe- riod its position toward the right, corre- sponding to downward motion. If the posi- tion of the lever toward the right is desig- nated by y = 1 (and correspondingly the position toward the left by y = - 1) we see that during the period of measurement, the position x > 0 corresponds to y = 1; but afterwards y = 1 stays on, even though x passes into the other interval x < 0. We see that in the utilization of the measurement the coupling of the two paraineters x and y disappears. We shall say, quite generally, that a pa- rameter y “nieasures” a parameter x (which varies according to a probability law), if the value of y is directed by the value of param- eter x at a given moment. A measurement procedure underlies the entropy decrease effected by the intervention of intelligent beings. One may reasonably assuiiie that a meas- urement procedure is fundamentally asso- ciated with a certain definite average entropy production, and that this restores concord- ance with the Second Law. The amount of entropy generated by the measurenient may, of course, always be greater than this funda- mental amount, but not smaller. To put it precisely: we have to distinguish here be- tween two entropy values. One of them, &, is produced when during t,he measurement y assumes the value 1, and the other, 8, , when y assunies the value - 1. We cannot expect to get general information about S1 or Sz separately, but we shall see that if the amount of entropy produced by the “meas- urement” is to compensate the entropy de- crease affected by utilization, the relation must always hold good. One sees from this formula that one can make one of the values, for instance 81, as small as one wishes, but then the other value A!?, becomes correspondingly greater. Fur- thermore, one can notice that the magnitude of the interval under consideration is of no consequence. One can also easily understand that it cannot be otherwise. Conversely, as long as the entropies 8, and , produced by the measurements, satisfy the inequality (l), we can be sure that the expected decrease of entropy caused by the later utilization of the measurement will be fully compensated. Before we proceed with the proof of in- equality (l), let us see in the light of the above mechanical example, how all this fits together. For the entropies & and & pro- duced by the measurements, we make the following Ansatz: 8, = 8, = k log 2 (2) This ansatz satisfies inequality (1) and the mean value of the quantity of entropy produced by a measurement is (of course in this special case independent of the fre- quencies w1 , w2 of the two events) : 8 = k log 2 (3) In this example one achieves a decrease of entropy by the isothermal expansion? v1 . - 31 = --klog ____ vl+ v2 ’ (4) The entropy generated is denoted by s,, ss. ON THE DECREASE OF ENTROPY 305 depending on whether the molecule was found in volume Vl or VZ when the piston was inserted. (The decrease of entropy equals the ratio of the quantity of heat taken froin the heat reservoir during the isothermal expansion, to the temperature of the heat reservoir in question). Since in the above case the frequencies w1 , WP are in the ratio of the volumes Vl , Vz , the mean value of the entropy generated is (a negative number) : 3 =w1.(+31) + WY(+ s,) = k log ___ vl+ VP Vl+VZ V2 v1 + (5) “1 V1 k log ____ VI+ vz Vl+VZ As one can see, we have, indeed v1 V2 Tr (6) klog ~ + ___ T’, + v, v1+ v2 v1+ vz v1 + klog2 2 0 aklog- v, + v2 S++g-Q. (7) VP and therefore : In the special case considered, we would actually have a full compensation for the de- crease of entropy achieved by the utilization of the measurement. We shall not examine more special cases, but instead try to clarify the matter by a general argument, and to derive formula (1). We shall therefore imagine the whole sys- tem-in which the co-ordinate x, exposed to some kind of thermal fluctuations, can be measured by the parameter y in the way just explained-as a multitude of particles, all enclosed in one box. Every one of these par- ticles can move freely, so that they may be considered as the molecules of an ideal gas, which, because of thernml agitation, wander about in the common box independently of each other and exert a certain pressure on the walls of the box-the pressure being deter- mined by the temperature. We shall now consider two of these molecules as chemi- cally different and, in principle, separable by semipermeable walls, if the co-ordinate x for one molecule is in a preassigned interval while the corresponding co-ordinate of the other molecule falls outside that interval. We also shall look upon them as chemically dif- ferent, if they differ only in that the y co- ordinate is +1 for one and - 1 for the other. We should like to give the box in which the “molecules” are stored the form of a hollow cylinder containing four pistons. Pistons A and A’ are fixed while the other two are inov- able, so that the distance BB’ always equals the distance AA’, as is indicated in Figure 1 by the two brackets. A‘, the bottom, and B, the cover of the container, are impermeable for all “molecules,” while A and B’ are semi- permeable; namely, A is permeable only for those “molecules” for which the parameter x is in the preassigned interval, i.e., (xl , x2), B’ is only permeable for the rest. A’ FIQ. 1 In the beginning the piston B is at A and therefore B’ at A’, and all “molecules” are in the space between. A certain fraction of the molecules have their co-ordinate x in the preassigned interval. We shall designate by w1 the probability that this is the case for a randomly selected molecule and by wP the probability that x is outside the interval. Then w1+ WP = 1. Let the distribution of the parameter y be over the values + 1 and - 1 in any propor- tion but in any event independent of the x-values. We imagine an intervention by an intelligent being, who imparts to y the value 1 for all “molecules” whose x at that moment is in the selected interval. Otherwise the value -1 is assigned. If then, because of thermal fluctuation, for any “molecule,” the parameter x should come out of the preas- signed interval or, as we also may put it, if the “molecule” suffers a monomolecular chemical reaction with regard to x (by which 306 LEO SZILARD it is transformed from a species that can pass the seniipernieable piston A into a species for which the piston is imperiiieable), then the parameter y retains its value 1 for the time being, so that the “molecule,” because of the value of the parameter y, “remembers” during the whole following process that x originally was in the preassigned interval. We shall see immediately what part this memory may play. After the intervention just discussed, we niove the piston, so that we separate the two kinds of inolecules with- out doing work. This results in two con- tainers, of which the first contains only the one modification and the second only the other. Each modification now occupies the same volume as the mixture did previously. In one of these containers, if considered by itself, there is now no equilibrium with re- gard to the two “modifications in x.)’ Of course the ratio of the two modifications has remained w1 : wz . If we allow t,his equilibrium to be achieved in both containers independ- ently and at constant volume arid tempera- ture, then the entropy of the systeni cer- tainly has increased. For the total heat release is 0, since the ratio of the two “niodifi- cations in x’) w1:w2 does not change. If we acconiplish the equilibrium distribution in both containers in a reversible fashion then the entropy of the rest of the world will de- crease by the same amount. Thcrefore the entropy increases by a negative value, and, the value of the entropy increase per mole- cule is exactly: (9) (The entropy constants that we must as- sign to the two “modifications in 5’’ do not occur here explicitly, as the process leaves the total number of molecules belonging to the one or the other species unchanged.) Yow of course we cannot bring the two gases back to the original volume without expenditure of work by simply moving the piston hack, as there are now in the con- tainer- which is bounded by the pistons BB’-also niolecules whose x-co-ordinate lies outside of the preassigned interval and for which the piston A is not permeable any longer. Thus one can see that the calculated decrease of entropy (Equation 191) does not mean a contradiction of the Second Law. As s = Ic(w1 log w1 + w2 log wp). long as we do not use the fact that the molecules in the container BB’, by virtue of their co- ordinate y, “remember” that the r-co-ordinate for the molecules of this container originally was in the preassigned inlerval, full conapensa- tion existsfor the calculated decrease of entropy, by virtue of the fact that the partial pres- sures in the two containers are snialler than in the original mixture. But now we can use the fact that all naole- cules in the container BB‘ hatie the y-co-ordi- nate I, and in the other accordingly -1, to bring all molecules baclc again to the original volume. To accomplish this we only need to replace the seniipermeable wall -4 by a wall A *, which is seniipermeable not with regard to x but with regard to y, naniely so that it is permeable for the molecules with the y-co- ordinate 1 and impermeable for the others. Correspondingly we replace B’ by a piston B’*, which is impermeable for the molecules with y = -1 and permeable for the others. Then both containers can be put into each other again without expenditure of energy. The distribution of the y-co-ordinate with regard to 1 and -1 now has become sta- tistically independent of the r-values and be- sides we are able to re-establish the original distribution over 1 and - 1. Thus we would have gone through a coniplete cycle. The only change that we have to register is the resulting decrease of entropy given by (9) : 3 = Ic(w1 log w1 + wt log wz). (10) If we do not wish to admit that the Second Law has been violated, we must conclude that the intervention which establishes the coupling between y and x, the iiieasurenzent of x by y, must be accompanied by a production of entropy. If a definite way of achieving this coupling is adopted and if the quantity of entropy that is inevitably produced is desig- nated by Sl and Sz , where S1 stands for the mean increase in entropy that occurs when y acquires the value 1, and accordingly Sz for the increase that occurs when y acquires the value - 1, we arrive at the equation: (11) In order for the Second Law to remain in force, this quantity of entropy must be greater than the decrease of entropy s, which according to (9) is produced by the utiliza- WlSl i- w2s2 = s“ ON THE DECREASE OF ENTROPY 307 tioii of the measurement. Therefore the fol- lowing unequality must be valid : S+SlO WlSl -I- WZS‘B (12) + k(w, log w1 + w2 log WB) 2 0 This equation must be valid for any values of w1 and w2 ,3 and of course the constraint w2 + wz = 1 cannot be violated. We ask, in particular, for which w1 and w2 and given 8-values the expression becomes a minimum. For the two minimizing values w1 and wz the inequality (12) must still be valid. Under the above constraint, the minimum occurs when the following equation holds : This is easily seen if one introduces the no- tation 81 SZ - + log w1 = - + log ~2 = X; k k (15) then : A -Silk w1 = e .e ; w2 = eA.e--s2’k. (16) If one substitutes these values into the in- equality (12) one gets: (17) e-Sl’k + e--szik ) 20. Therefore the following also holds: X 2 0. (18) If one puts the values w1 and wz from (16) into the equation w1 + w2 = 1, one gets - e .

As long as we allow intelligent beings to perforni the intervention, a direct test is 3 The increase in entropy can depend only on the types of measurement and their results but not on how many systems of one or the other type were present. not possible. But we can try to describe sini- ple nonliving devices that effect such cou- pling, and see if indeed entropy is generated and in what quantity. Having already recog- nized that the only important factor is a certain characteristic type of coupling, a “measurement,” we need not construct any complicated models which imitate the inter- vention of living beings in detail. We can be satisfied with t,he construction of this par- ticular type of coupling which is accoin- panied by memory. In our next example, the position co-or- dinate of an oscillating pointer is “measured” by the energy content of a body K. The pointer is supposed to connect, in a purely mechanical way, the body K-by whose energy content the position of the pointer is to be measured--by heat conduction with one of two intermediate pieces, A or B. The body is connected with A as long as the co- ordinate-which determines the position of the pointer-falls into a certain preassigned, but otherwise arbitrarily large or small inter- val a, and ot,herwise if the co-ordinate is in the interval b, with B. Up to a certain mo- ment, namely the moment of the “measure- ment,” both intermediate pieces will be thermally connected with a heat reservoir at temperature To. At this moment the inser- tion A will be cooled reversibly to the tem- perature TA , e.g., by a periodically function- ing mechanical device. That is, after successive contacts with heat reservoirs of intermediate temperatures, A will be brought into contact with a heat reservoir of the temperature Ta . At the same time the inser- tion B will be heated in the same way to temperature Tg . Then the intermediate pieces will again be isolated from the corre- sponding heat reservoirs. We assume that the position of the pointer changes so slowly that all the operations that we have sketched take place while the position of the pointer remains unchanged. If the position co-ordinate of the pointer fell in the preassigned interval, then the body was connected with the insertion A during the above-mentioned operation, and conse- quently is now cooled to temperature Ta . In the opposite case, the body is now heated to temperature T, . Its energy con- tent becomes-according to the position of 308 LEO SZILARD the pointer at the time of “measurement”- small at temperature Ta or great at tempera- ture TB and will retain its value, even if the pointer eventually leaves the preassigned interval or enters into it. After some time, while the pointer is still oscillating, one can no longer draw any definite conclusion from the energy content of the body K with re- gard to the momentary position of the pointer but one can draw a definite conclu- sion with regard to the position of the pointer at the time of the measurement. Then the measurement is completed. After the measurement has been ac- complished, the above-mentioned periodic- ally functioning mechanical device should connect the thermally isolated insertions A and R with the heat reservoir To. This has the purpose of bringing the body K-which is now also connected with one of the two intermediate pieces-back into its original state. The direct connection of the intermedi- ate pieces and hence of the body K-which has been either cooled to TA or heated to TB-to the reservoir To consequently causes an increase of entropy. This cannot possibly be avoided, because it would make no sense to heat the insertion A reversibly to the temperature To by successive contacts with the reservoirs of intermediate temperatures and to cool B in the same manner. After the measurement we do not know with which of the two insertions the body K is in contact at that moment; nor do we know whether it had been in connection with TA or TB in the end. Therefore neither do we know whether we should use intermediate temperatures be- tween TA and To or between To and Te. The mean value of the quantity of en- tropy S1 and Sz, per measurement, can be calculated, if the heat capacity as a function of the temperature a(T) is known for the body I(, since the entropy can be calculated from the heat capacity. We have, of course, neglected the heat capacities of the inter- mediate pieces. If the position co-ordinate of the pointer was in the preassigned inter- val at the time of the “measurement,” and accordingly the body in connection with in- sertion A, then the entropy conveyed to the heat reservoirs during successive cooling was (21) However, following this, the entropy with- drawn from the reservoir To by direct con- tact with it was (22) $To) - G(TA) TO All in all the entropy was increased by the amount Analogously, the entropy will increase by the following amount, if the body was in con- tact with the intermediate piece B at the time of the “measurenient”: We shall now evaluate Ihese expressions for the very simple case, where the body which we use has only two energy states, a lower and a higher state. If such a body is in thermal contact with a heat reservoir at any temperature T, the probability that it is in the lower or upper state is given by re- spectively: Here u stands for the difference of energy of the two states and g for the statistical weight. We can set the energy of the lower state equal to zero without loss of generality. Therefore :4 Here p and p are the functions of T given See the Appendix. ON THE DECREASE OF ENTROPY 309 hy equation (25), which are here to be taken for the argu1iient.s TO , TA , or TB . If (as is necessitated by the above concept of a “measurement”) we wish to draw a dependable conclusion from the energy con- tent of the body K as to the position co-or- dinate of the pointer, we have to see to it that the body surely gets into the lower energy state when it gets into contact with TB . In other words: This of course cannot be achieved, but may be arbitrarily approximated by allowing TA to approach absolute zero and the statis- tical weight g to approach infinity. (In this limiting process, To is also changed, in such a way that TO) and q(To) remain constant.) The equation (26) then becomes: and if we form the expression e--sAJk + (29) e-SBlk , we find: e--S~/k + e--SB/k - - 1. Our foregoing considerations have thus just realized the smallest permissible limiting care. The use of semipermeable walls ae- cording to Figure 1 allows a complete utilization of the measurement: inequality (1) certainly cannot be sharpened. As we have seen in this example, a simple inanimate device can achieve the same essential result as would be achieved by the intervention of intelligent beings. We have examined the “biological phenomena” of a nonliving device and have seen that it gen- erates exactly that quantity of entropy which is required by thermodynamics.
