Electric Field of a Charged Disk 1 First Exercise Set Background Theory: Electric Field of a Charge Distribution The electric field of a spatial charge distribution with volume charge density ρ(r) is E(r) = 1 4πϵ0 ˚ V ρ(˜r) d3˜r |r − ˜r| 2 r − ˜r |r − ˜r| , where ˜r is a placeholder variable for integration and ρ(˜r) d3˜r is an infinitesimal element of charge at the position ˜r. 1.1 Electric Field of a Charged Disk A charged disk has surface charge density σ and radius a. Find the disk’s electric field E(z) along an axis through the disk’s center and normal to the disk. Analyze the limit behavior of E(z) for small and large z. We begin by breaking the disk into concentric rings and integrating over the con- tributions dE of each ring, where r and dr represent the radius and thickness of a ring, respectively. We then further divide each ring into infinitesimal segments with area r dϕ dr. Along the perpendicular z axis through the disk’s center, a single such segment contributes the electric field dE1 = 1 4πϵ0 σr dϕ dr z2 + r2 . Notice the term r dϕ dr must have units of area to produce charge when multiplied by the surface charge density σ. The term z2 + r2 is simply the squared distance from the charge element to the z axis. Next, we recognize the circular symmetry of each ring: both the x and y components of the electric field symmetrically cancel along the z axis, so the electric field only has a z component. We then relate the magnitudes of dE and dE1 along the z axis with similar triangles to get the contribution dE of a ring of radius r at the point (0, 0, z): dE dE1 = z √ z2 + r2 =⇒ dE = z (z2 + r2)3/2 σr dϕ dr 4πϵ0 . We find the total electric field E(z) by integrating over the contributions dE: E(z) = ˆ dE = ˆ 2π 0 ˆ a 0 dϕ dr σzr 4πϵ0(z2 + r2)3/2 = σz 2ϵ0 ˆ a 0 r dr (z2 + r2)3/2 . We solve the integral with the substitution u = z2 + r2, du = 2r dr: E(z) = ˆ z2+a2 z2 du u3/2 = − σz 2ϵ0 ( 1 √z2 + a2 − 1 √z2 ) = σ 2ϵ0 ( 1 − z √z2 + a2 ) = σ 2ϵ0 ( 1 − 1 1 + a2 z2 ) . 4 1.2. Charged Plate with a Slit For z ≪ a (very close to the disk), we have 1 + a2 z2 → ∞ and 1 1+ a2 z2 → 0, leaving E(z) → σ 2ϵ0 (z ≪ a), which is the electric field of an infinite charged plane. For z ≫ a (very far from the disk), we have a2 z2 ≪ 1 and use the Taylor approximation (1 + x)p ≈ 1 + px for x ≪ 1 to get E(z) = σ 2ϵ0 [ 1 − ( 1 + a2 z2 )−1/2] ≈ σ 2ϵ0 [ 1 − ( 1 − a2 2z2 )] = σa2 4ϵ0z2 . Finally, we multiply above and below by π to match the above result to the expression for a point charge: E(z) = πa2σ 4πϵ0z2 = σS 4πϵ0z2 = q 4πϵ0z2 (z ≫ a), where q = σS is the disk’s charge. 1.2 Charged Plate with a Slit We take a large, rectangular charged plate with surface charged density σ and remove a slit of width a from the plate. Determine the electric field E in the plane perpendicular to the plate and passing through the center of the slit as a function of the vertical distance z from the plate. Analyze the limit behavior of E(z) for small and large z. We begin by breaking the plate into thin rib- bons and integrating over the contributions dE of each ribbon, where r and dr will represent the orthogonal distance from the slit and the thickness of each ribbon, respectively. We find the electric field of a ribbon a distance r from the slit along the z axis using Gauss’s law with a cylindrical surface. For a cylinder of radius R and length l, Gauss’s law reads ‹ S E · dS = 2πRlE = qenc ϵ0 =⇒ E(R) = qenc 2πϵ0lR . Applied to the ribbon, the enclosed charge qenc is the ribbon’s infinitesimal charge dq1 = σ dS1 = σl dr, while the cylinder’s radius R is the distance from the ribbon to the z axis: R = √z2 + r2, so the contribution dE1 of one ribbon is dE1 = dq1 2πϵ0l√z2 + r2 = σl dr 2πϵ0l√z2 + r2 = σ dr 2πϵ0√z2 + r2 . Because of mirror-image symmetry, both the x and y components of the electric field cancel, leaving only the z component dEz. We then relate dEz and dE1 using similar triangles dEz dE1 = z √z2 + r2 =⇒ dEz = σz dr 2πϵ0(z2 + r2) . 5 1.2. Charged Plate with a Slit We find the total electric field along the z axis by integrating over the contributions dEz of all the ribbons. Because of mirror symmetry, we need to calculate only the contribution of e.g. the right plane and multiple the result by two. E(z) = ˆ dEz = 2 ˆ ∞ a/2 ( σz dr 2πϵ0(z2 + r2) ) = σz πϵ0 ˆ ∞ a/2 dr z2 + r2 = σz πϵ0 [ 1 z arctan r z ]∞ a/2 = σ πϵ0 [ π 2 − arctan( a 2z )] . In the limit z ≫ a (very far from the slit), we have arctan a 2z → 0 and the electric field along the z axis simplifies to E(z) = σ 2ϵ0 (z ≫ a), which is the field of an infinite sheet of charge. In the limit z ≪ a (very close to the slit), we have a 2z → ∞. We use the asymptotic expansion arctan x ≈ π 2 − 1 x for large x to get E(z) ≈ σ πϵ0 [ π 2 − ( π 2 − 2z a )] = 2σ πϵ0 z a . In this case the electric field scales linearly as E ∼ z. 6 2.1. Theory: The Poisson Equation and the Fourier Transform 2 Second Exercise Set 2.1 Theory: The Poisson Equation and the Fourier Transform We begin with Gauss’s law in differential form and the relationship between electric field E and electric potential U ∇ · E = ρ ϵ0 and E = −∇U We then substitute E = −∇U into Gauss’s law to get ∇ · [ − ∇U ] = ρ ϵ0 =⇒ ∇ 2U = − ρ ϵ0 . The last equality has the form of a Poisson equation,1 and relates charge density ρ to electric potential U . In other words, if we know a spatial charge distribution ρ, we can find the corresponding electric potential U and thus the electric field E with E = −∇U . As a simple example we start with a point charge. The charge distribution is ρ(r) = qδ(r) =⇒ ∇ 2U = − ρ ϵ0 = − q ϵ0 δ(r). The above equation is the Poisson equation for a point charge. We will solve the equation with a Fourier transform. First, we briefly review the Fourier transform, which we can think of as an expansion over a basis of plane waves of the form eik·r. The expression U (k) plays the role of a weight function and determines how much each wave contributes to the expansion U (r) = ˚ U (k)e ik·r d 3k, where U (k) is the amplitude of the plane wave with wave vector k. To find U (k) we take the inner product of both sides of the above equation with the basis function e−i˜k·r, which gives ˚ U (r)e −i˜k·r d 3r = ˚ ˚ d 3k d 3rU (k)ei(k−˜k)·r. The integral over r on the right-hand side is in fact a delta function, because the orthogonal plane waves cancel out over all space except at the origin, where they constructively interfere to infinity. Recognizing the delta function simplifies the equation to ˚ U (r)e −i˜k·r d 3r = (2π)3 ˚ U (k)δ(k − ˜k) d 3k = (2π)3U (˜k). The delta function suppresses the integral everywhere except at (k − ˜k), which leads to the expression for the amplitude U (˜k) of a wave vector ˜k: U (˜k) = 1 (2π)3 ˚ U (r)e −ik·r d 3r. 1In general any equation of the form ∇ 2f (r) = g(r) is called a Poisson equation. 7 2.2. Poisson Equation for a Point Particle This expression can also be interpreted as an inverse Fourier transform, used to recover U (k) from U (r). As an intermediate step, we analyze the behavior of the gradient operator under the Fourier transform. Since the gradient acts only on r, applying the gradient to the earlier expression for U (r) gives ∇U (r) = ˚ U (k)∇e ik·r d 3k. Evaluating the gradient over (x, y, z) components gives ∇eik·r =   ikx iky ikz   ei(k1x+k2y+k3z) = ikeik·r. The expression for ∇U (r) is thus ∇U (r) = ˚ U (k)∇e ik·r d 3k = ˚ U (k)ikeik·r d 3k, which is a Fourier transform of the function U (k)ik. In other words, the gradient op- erator ∇ transforms to multiplication by ik under the Fourier transform. Analogously, the Laplacian ∇2 transform into multiplication by (ik)2 = −k2. Finally, we consider the behavior of the delta function under the Fourier transform. Let δ(k) denote the amplitude in the expansion of δ(r), analogous to the relationship between U (k) and U (r). Using the inverse Fourier transform and the integral properties of the delta function produces δ(k) = 1 (2π)3 ˚ δ(r)e −ik·r d 3r = 1 (2π)3 e−ik·0 = 1 (2π)3 . In other words, the delta function transforms to 1/(2π)3 in Fourier space. Recipe: We now state the recipe for solving the Poisson equation in Fourier space. Take the Fourier transform the Poisson equation from r into k space (where the Laplacian operator ∇2 simplifies to −ik2 under the Fourier transform) and solve for the amplitude U (k) of each plane wave e−ik·r. Substitute U (k) into the Fourier transform, U (r) = ˚ U (k)e ik·r d 3k, and evaluate the integral—typically in spherical coordinates—to find find U (r). 2.2 Poisson Equation for a Point Particle The Poisson equation for a point particle is ∇2U (r) = − q ϵ0 δ(r). Solve the equation for U (r). 8 2.2. Poisson Equation for a Point Particle The plan is to transform into k space, solve for U (k), then transform back to U (r). First, we take the Fourier transform of both sides—use the Fourier transform identities ∇2 → −k2 and δ(r) → 1 (2π)3 from the theory section. −k2U (k) = − q ϵ0 1 (2π)3 =⇒ U (k) = q (2π)3ϵ0k2 . Next, we find U (r) using a second Fourier transform U (r) = ˚ d 3k qeik·r k2ϵ0(2π)3 = q (2π)3ϵ0 ˚ eik·r k2 d 3k. To solve the integral, we introduce an angle θ between r and k and transform to spherical coordinates to get U (r) = q (2π)3ϵ0 ˆ 2π 0 dϕ ˆ 1 −1 d[cos θ] ˆ ∞ 0 dkk2 eikr cos θ k2 . Integration over the azimuthal angle ϕ is simple, and produces 2π: U (r) = q (2π)2ϵ0 ˆ 1 −1 ˆ ∞ 0 e i cos θkr d[cos θ] dk. Next, we integrate first over θ, (to avoid ei cos θ·∞ from the upper k limit) and recognize the sine function in the difference of exponential functions: U (r) = q (2π)2ϵ0 ˆ ∞ 0 ei cos θkr ikr ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 θ=−1 dk = q (2π)2ϵ0 ˆ ∞ 0 eikr − e−ikr ikr dk = q (2π)2ϵ0 ˆ ∞ 0 2 sin(kr) kr dk = 2q (2π)2ϵ0 ˆ ∞ 0 sinc(κr) dk The integral of the sinc function is ˆ ∞ 0 sin x x dx = π 2 , and applying this integral to the expression for U (r) gives U (r) = 2q (2π)2ϵ0 π 2r = q 4πϵ0r , which is the electric potential of a point charge. Note that we have derived this expression directly from Maxwell’s equations, rather than taking it for granted as in introductory electromagnetism courses. Finally, we substitute the result for U (r) into the Poisson equation for a point charge. The result is ∇2 q 4πϵ0r = − q ϵ0 δ(r) =⇒ ∇ 2 1 r = −4πδ(r), which will be useful in the next problems. 9 2.3. Theoretical Interlude: Electric Field of a Charge Distribution 2.3 Theoretical Interlude: Electric Field of a Charge Distribution We just solved the Poisson equation for the simple case ρ(r) = δ(r). Can we use this result to solve the general case ρ = ρ(r)? The answer is yes, if we expand ρ(r) over a basis of delta functions, as follows: ρ(r) = ˚ d 3˜rρ(˜r)δ(r − ˜r). In this case, the solution of U (r) to the Poisson equation is U (r) = ˚ d 3˜rρ(˜r) 1 4πϵ0|r − ˜r| = 1 4πϵ0 ˚ d3˜rρ(˜r) |r − ˜r| . This result is quite powerful—by solving the Poisson equation for a delta function and then expanding an arbitrary ρ(r) in terms of the delta function, we now have the solution to the Poisson equation for any ρ(r). We find the corresponding electric field with E = −∇U = 1 4πϵ0 ˚ d3˜rρ(˜r) |r − ˜r| 2 r − ˜r |r − ˜r| , which agrees with the equation quoted in the previous exercise set. 2.4 Electric Field of a Hydrogen Atom The hydrogen atom has the electric potential U (r) = q 4πϵ0 e−αr r (1 + αr 2 ) , α = 2 rB . Find the charge density ρ(r) that generates this potential. We use the Poisson equation, which connects U and ρ via ∇2U (r) = − ρ(r) ϵ0 . We then calculate the Laplacian of our U (r) and work in spherical coordinates, since the potential is spherically symmetric (depends only on r). As a review, when acting on a function that depends only on r, ∇2 in spherical coordinates reads ∇2 = 1 r2 ∂ ∂r ( r2 ∂ ∂r ) . Applying ∇2 to U (r), after some straightforward but rather tedious differentiation, leads to ∇2U (r) = qα3 8πϵ0 e −αr. Rearranging the Poisson equation then gives ρ(r) = − qα3 8π e −αr. 10 2.4. Electric Field of a Hydrogen Atom Note that the charge density is negative, which corresponds to the negatively charged electron cloud. Inserting the definition of α = 2 rB gives ρ(r) = − q πr3 B e− 2r rB . Another interpretation: e − 2r rB is equivalent to (e − r rB )2, which is the square of the hydrogen atom’s ground state wave function. The square of the wave function is probability, and multiplying the probability by q r3 B gives a charge density. Note that—incorrectly—the proton’s charge does not contribute to our expression for ρ(r). This is because the proton occurs at the origin, which corresponds to a charge density singularity at the origin. To avoid dealing with this singularity, we simply ignored it when evaluating the Laplacian ∇2 We can resolve this problem by separately considering the special case lim r→0 U (r) = q 4πϵ0r . which just says the that potential should approach the ∼ 1/r proton potential at the origin. We would then have to solve the Poisson equation for this potential. However, we already now the solution—the potential is the potential for a point charge and corresponds to a charge density ρ(r) = qδ(r). The correct total result for the hydrogen atom is the sum of the electron cloud result and the charge density of the proton nucleus: ρ(r) = qδ(r) − qα3 8π e −αr. Lesson: Be careful when working with the Poisson equation if U (r) has singularities! 11 3.1. Conducting Ribbon in a Parallel-Plate Capacitor 3 Third Exercise Set Theory: The Laplace Equation As a quick review from the last exercise set: the Poisson equation used to solve for the electric field potential generated by a charge density ρ is ∇2U (r) = − ρ(r) ϵ0 where ∇2 = ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 + ∂2 ∂z2 . Often ρ(r) = 0 in places we’re solving for the electric potential. In this case ∇2U (r) = 0. This equation is called a Laplace equation. 3.1 Conducting Ribbon in a Parallel-Plate Capacitor We place a long, thin conducting ribbon be- tween the plates of a large parallel-plate capac- itor, perpendicularly to the plates; the ribbon almost touches both plates with a small, in- sulating layer of air between the ribbon edges and the plates. The ribbon height and dis- tance between the plates is a. We ground both plates and set the ribbon potential to U0. What is the resulting electric potential inside the capacitor? First, we decide on a coordinate system—we will use a Cartesian coordinates because of the problem’s rectangular symmetry. We choose the y axis to vertically connect the two ribbons (along the same line as a in the figure), the x axis to run from left to right in the plane of the page, and the z axis to point out of the page. Note that the problem is independent of z (by translation symmetry in the z direction), so we only need U (x, y). More so, the problem has reflection symmetry, so we can find the solution on only one side of the ribbon (one half of the x axis) and reflect the solution about the y axis. The space between the capacitor plates is empty—there is no charge, and we use the Laplace equation for the space between the plates. ∇2U (x, y) = 0. Charge can occur only along the ribbon or on the capacitor plates. Next, we determine boundary conditions for U (x, y) so the equation has a unique solution; the problem’s boundaries are the ribbon and edges of the capacitor plates. On the bottom plate, U (x, 0) = 0. On the upper plate, U (x, a) = 0; both potentials are zero because the plates are grounded, while along the ribbon we have U (0, y) = U0. We need one more boundary—infinity. At infinity, we require only that U (x → ∞, y) is bounded, i.e. that U does not diverge at ∞. First, we attempt solving the problem with separation of variables and write U (x, y) = X(x)Y (y)—this approach tends to work well with symmetric problems. Substituting 12 3.1. Conducting Ribbon in a Parallel-Plate Capacitor this ansatz into the Laplace equation and evaluating ∇2 gives X ′′Y + XY ′′ = 0 =⇒ X ′′ X = − Y ′′ Y . The separation of variables is successful—we succeeded in isolating x-dependent and y-dependent terms on different sides of the equation. We then set the equation equal to a separation constant κ2 and get two equations, X ′′ − κ2X = 0 and Y ′′ + κ 2Y = 0. Both equations have simple solutions! The equations for X and Y are solved by exponential and sinusoidal functions, respectively. X(x) = Ae κx + Be−κx and Y (y) = C sin(κy) + D cos(κy). We then substitute the expressions for X and Y back into the ansatz U = XY : U (x, y) = X(x)Y (y) = (Ae κx + Be−κx) (C sin(κy) + D cos(κy)) . We find the coefficients A, B, C and D using the boundary conditions. • We begin with the most powerful condition, that U (x → ∞, y) is bounded. This condition implies A = 0 to suppress the divergent exponential function eκ. • Then, we use the next two simplest conditions, the ones requiring U (x, y) = 0. Beginning with U (x, 0) = 0, we have 0 ≡ U (x, 0) = 1 · (0 + D) =⇒ D = 0. With both A = D = 0, we’re left at this point with only U (x, y) = Be−κx · C sin(κy). • Next, we apply the condition U (x, a) = 0 to get 0 ≡ U (x, a) = Be−κxC sin(κa) ≡ F e −κx sin(κa), where we’ve joined the product of two constants into a single constant F = BC. We have two options: either F = 0 or sin(κa) = 0. The option F = 0 gives the trivial solution U (x, y) = 0. The non-trivial solution comes from sin(κa) = 0 =⇒ κa = nπ, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Note that n = 0 leads to a trivial solution U (x, y) = 0, which we reject. With respect to the quantization of κ and F by the index n, the general solution at this point is the linear superposition U (x, y) = ∞∑ n=1 Fne −κnx sin(κny). 13 3.1. Conducting Ribbon in a Parallel-Plate Capacitor • To find Fn, we use the final boundary condition U (0, y) = U0. U0 = ∞∑ n=1 Fn sin(κny) = ∞∑ n=1 Fn sin ( nπy a ), where we’ve used κn = nπ a . This is a Fourier expansion of the constant U0 over sine functions. We find the coefficients by taking the inner product of both sides of the equation, which amounts to multiplying both sides by sin mπy a and integrating both sides over y from 0 to a. The left side of the equation for U0 becomes U0 ˆ a 0 sin ( mπy a ) dy = − U0a mπ cos( mπy a )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ a 0 = U0a mπ [ 1 − (−1) m] . On the right hand side, with the sum, we switch the sum and integral to get ∞∑ n=1 Fn ˆ a 0 sin ( nπy a ) sin ( mπy a ) dy = ∞∑ n=1 Fnδmn ˆ a 0 sin 2 ( mπy a ) dy = Fma 2 . Because of the orthogonality of the sine functions, the integral is zero for m ̸= n, and only the case m = n gives a non-zero result. Equating the two sides gives the desired expression for Fm: U0a mπ [ 1 − (−1) m] = Fma 2 =⇒ Fm = 2U0 mπ [ 1 − (−1) m] . With Fm known, the final result for U (x, y) is then U (x, y) = 2U0 π ∞∑ n=1 1 − (−1)n n exp(− nπx a ) sin ( nπy a ). Some limit cases: for x ≫ a, the exponent terms very small, and we can neglect all terms in the series except the first term e− πx a with n = 1. The result is U (x, y) = 4U0 π exp(− πx a ) sin ( πy a ). A separate case for which we can find a nice analytic solution is at the center of the capacitor at y = a 2 . The solution reads U (x, a 2 ) = 2U0 π ∞∑ n=1 1 − (−1)n n exp(− nπx a ) sin ( nπ 2 ). Instead of finding U (x, a 2 ), we’ll find the electric field E(x, a 2 ). Because of reflection symmetry across the line y = a 2 , the electric field cannot have a y component—E only has an x component. We’ll find Ex(x) from the potential: Ex(x) = − ∂ ∂x U (x, a 2 ) = − 2U0 a ∞∑ n=1 [ 1 − (−1) n] exp(− nπx a ) sin ( nπ 2 ). 14 3.2. A Halved Conducting Cylinder Next, note that [ 1 − (−1) n] sin ( nπ 2 ) =    0 n even 2 n = 1, 5, 9, . . . −2 n = 3, 7, 11, . . . . The sum simplifies to Ex(x) = 4U0 a [e − πx a − e − 3πx a + e − 5πx a ∓ . . .] = 4U0 a e − πx a [ 1 − e− 2πx a + (e− 2πx a )2 ∓ . . .] , which is a geometric series in e− 2πx a . The result is Ex(x) = 4U0 a e− πx a 1 + e− 2πx a = 4U0 a 1 e πx a + e− πx a = 2U0 a cosh ( πx a ) . 3.2 A Halved Conducting Cylinder Consider a long cylinder of radius a cut in half along a plane running along the cylin- der’s longitudinal axis. We separate the two cylinder halves by an arbitrarily small amount (so the halves are insulated) and apply a po- tential difference U0 between the two halves. The halved cylinder acts as a capacitor. Find the electric potential inside the cylinder. We must first decide on a coordinate system, and will use cylindrical coordinates because the problem has cylindrical symmetry. Let the z axis run along the cylinder’s longitudinal axis. Because of translational symmetry along the z axis, U is independent of z. There is no charge inside the cylinder, so the electric potential in the cylinder obeys the Laplace equation ∇2U (r, ϕ) = 0. (I have used U for electric potential and ϕ for the cylindrical coordinate system’s angular coordinate.) In cylindrical coordinates (when acting on a function independent of z), the Laplacian operator reads ∇2 = 1 r ∂ ∂r ( r ∂ ∂r ) + 1 r2 ∂2 ∂ϕ2 . In our case, ∇2U (r, ϕ) = 1 r ∂ ∂r (r ∂U ∂r ) + 1 r2 ∂2U ∂ϕ2 = 0. Following the usual recipe, we separate variables using the ansatz U (r, ϕ) = R(r)Φ(ϕ). Substituting this ansatz into the Laplace equation leads to Φ 1 r (rR′)′ + R r2 Φ′′ = Φ ( R′ r + R′′) + R r2 Φ′′ = 0. 15 3.2. A Halved Conducting Cylinder Note that r′ = 1. Dividing through by Φ and rearranging gives rR′ R + r2 R′′ R = − Φ′′ Φ . Following the usual separation procedure, we set both sides equal to the separation constant m2. The equations for Φ and R read Φ′′ + m 2Φ = 0 and r2R′′ + rR′ − m 2R = 0. The solution for Φ is sinusoidal: Φ(ϕ) = A sin(mϕ) + B cos(mϕ). Now, our cylindrical problem is periodic in ϕ with period 2π—this just means the cylinder repeats after one revolution. Periodicity in ϕ is possible only if m takes on integer values, so we can immediately index the solutions for Φ with Φm(ϕ) = Am sin(mϕ) + Bm cos(mϕ), m = 1, 2, 3, . . . . We only use positive integers because the odd/even symmetry of sin and cos means negative integers give the same result as positive one—solving for negative m would be redundant. We reject m = 0 because this solution leads to Φ′′ = 0, meaning Φ is a linear function. But a linear function can’t be periodic in ϕ, so we reject m = 0. The second equation for R is solved with powers of r. The result is Rm(r) = Cmrm + Dmr−m. The general solution is the linear superposition U (r, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=1 Φm(ϕ)Rm(m) = ∞∑ m=1 (Am sin(mϕ) + Bm cos(mϕ)) (Cmrm + Dmr−m) . Note: We ended the problem at this point (ran out of time) and continued in the fourth exercise set. 16 4.1. A Halved Conducting Cylinder (continued) 4 Fourth Exercise Set 4.1 A Halved Conducting Cylinder (continued) We left off in the previous exercise set with the general solution U (r, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=1 Φm(ϕ)Rm(m) = ∞∑ m=1 (Am sin(mϕ) + Bm cos(mϕ)) (Cmrm + Dmr−m) for the potential inside the cylinder. To find a solution specific to our problem, we apply boundary conditions. We already applied the periodic boundary condition U (r, ϕ) = U (r, ϕ + 2π), which required m be integer-valued. A second boundary condition requires the capacitor halves have a potential difference U0 between them. It is best to write this potential difference in the symmetric form U (a, ϕ) = { U0 2 ϕ ∈ (0, π) − U0 2 ϕ ∈ (π, 2π). There is another condition—that U does not diverge at r = 0. This condition implies the Dm coefficients are zero, because the Dmr−m term diverges at r = 0. Observation: the second boundary condition is an odd function of ϕ. This implies that only odd (sine) terms can appear in the final solution. This allows us to set the Am coefficients equal to zero to eliminate the cosine terms. We are left with U (r, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=1 Fmrm sin(mϕ), where we have defined BmCm ≡ Fm. Applying the second boundary condition at r = a gives U (a, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=1 Fmam sin(mϕ). To solve this, we take the scalar product of the equation with sin(nϕ): ˆ 2π 0 U (a, ϕ) sin(nϕ) dϕ = ˆ 2π 0 ∞∑ m=1 Fma m sin(mϕ) sin(nϕ) dϕ. Plugging in the step values of U (a, ϕ) gives U0 2 ˆ π 0 sin(nϕ) dϕ − U0 2 ˆ 2π π sin(nϕ) dϕ = ˆ 2π 0 ∞∑ m=1 Fma m sin(mϕ) sin(nϕ) dϕ. First, we solve the left-hand side U0 2 [ − 1 n cos(nϕ) ∣ ∣π 0 + 1 n cos(nϕ) ∣ ∣2π π ] = U0 2n [− cos(πn) + 1 + 1 − cos(nπ)] = U0 n (1 − (−1) n) , 17 4.1. A Halved Conducting Cylinder (continued) where we’ve used the identity cos(nπ) = (−1)n. Next, we solve the right-hand side. Switching the order of integration and summation gives ∞∑ m=1 Fma m ˆ 2π 0 sin(mϕ) sin(nϕ) dϕ = ∞∑ m=1 Fma m ( 2π 2 δmn ) = Fnanπ. Combining the left and right sides gives Fn = U0[ 1 − (−1)n] πnan . So, the solution for U (r, ϕ) is U (r, ϕ) = ∞∑ n=1 [ U0[1 − (−1)n] πnan ] rn sin(nϕ) = U0 π ∞∑ n=1 ( r a )n [1 − (−1)n] n sin(nϕ). Next, some limiting cases. It will be easier to work in terms of electric field instead of potential. We will find the electric field in the two planes parallel and perpendicular to the slit between the capacitor halves. First, in the perpendicular (vertical) plane. The field points from high to low potential, so from the top half of the capacitor to the bottom half. In this plane we can work with just one coordinate r, which represents the vertical distance from the cylinder’s center. Note that ϕ = π 2 . The component Er we’re after is Er = − ∂ ∂r U (r, ϕ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ϕ= π 2 = − U0 π ∞∑ n=1 n ( r a )n−1 1 a [1 − (−1)n] n sin(nϕ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ϕ= π 2 = − U0 πa ∞∑ n=1 ( r a )n−1 [1 − (−1)n] n sin ( nπ 2 ). The sum simplifies considerably when you realize 1 − (−1)n n sin ( nπ 2 ) =    0 n even 2 n = 1, 5, . . . −2 n = 3, 7, . . . . We can then write the field as a geometric series Er = −2U0 πa [1 − ( r a )2 + ( r a )4 ∓ · · · ] = −2U0 πa 1 1 + ( r a )2 . Note that Er is largest at r = 0, decreases monotonically with increasing r, and falls to half of its maximum value at r = a. In a field parallel to the slit, we would set ϕ = 0. This plane is perpendicular to the vertical plane, which used the radial component Er, so for the parallel plane we work with the ϕ component Eϕ. Eϕ = − 1 r ∂ ∂ϕ U (r, ϕ)∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ϕ=0. 18 4.2. Conducting Sphere in a Uniform Electric Field As before, the sum simplifies considerably to a geometric series. The result turns out to be Eϕ = − 2U0 πa 1 1 − ( r a )2 . Note that Eϕ diverges at r = a. This is a consequence of the very small slit spacing between the capacitor halves at r = a; schematically have E = U0 d → ∞ as d → 0. 4.2 Conducting Sphere in a Uniform Electric Field A conducting sphere of radius a is placed in a uniform electric field E0 pointing in the z direction. Find the electric potential U inside and outside the sphere. We will use spherical coordinates to take advantage of spherical symmetry, meaning we aim to solve for electric potential U in the form U (r, ϕ, θ). Because of the problem’s rotational symmetry, the solution will be independent of ϕ, and we need only solve for U (r, θ). The sphere is at a constant potential because it is a conductor. We’ll set U = 0 inside the sphere. In the space around the sphere, we solve the Laplace equation ∇2U (r, θ) = 0. We then separate variables via U = R(r)Θ(θ), which leads to the general solution U (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 [Alrl + Blr−(l+1)] Pl(cos θ), where Pl are the Legendre polynomials. On to the boundary conditions. On the surface we’ll set U (a, θ) = 0. And at infinity, we use the boundary condition U (r → ∞, 0) = −E0z = −E0r cos θ. This is the potential of a uniform electric field (at infinity, the potential from the sphere is negligible). This potential is chosen so that − ∂U ∂z = E0, i.e. so that the potential at infinity recovers the uniform electric field E0. We’ll start with the second boundary condition at r → ∞. Applying the condition to the general solution gives ∞∑ l=0 AlrlPl(cos θ) = −E0r cos θ. Note that the r−(l+1) terms vanish as r → ∞. The entire series equals a single term proportional to cos θ and the equality holds if only the l = 1 term in the series 19 4.2. Conducting Sphere in a Uniform Electric Field is non-zero, which generates a corresponding cos θ term from P1(cos θ) = cos θ ie. P1(x) = x. The l = 1 term is A1r cos θ = −E0r cos θ =⇒ A1 = −E0, so we have Al = −E0δl1. The solution for U (r, θ) simplifies to U (r, θ) = −E0r cos θ + ∞∑ l=1 Blr−(l+1)Pl(cos θ). Next, the second boundary condition: U (a, θ) = 0. Substituting the condition into the intermediate solution gives E0a cos θ = ∞∑ l=1 Bla −(l+1)Pl(cos θ). Again, the entire series equals only a single term. Again, this will be the l = 1 term corresponding to P1(cos θ) = cos θ. For l ̸= 1 we have Bl = 0. The l = 1 term gives E0a cos θ = B1a −2 cos θ =⇒ B1 = E0a 3. With Al and Bl known for all l, the final result is U (r, θ) = −E0r cos θ + E0a3 r2 cos θ. The first term, −E0r cos θ, is the potential of the uniform external field E0. The second term comes from the sphere. In fact, this second term has the same form as the potential of an electric dipole! Limiting cases are discussed in the next exercise set. 20 5.1. Conducting Sphere in a Uniform Electric Field (continued) 5 Fifth Exercise Set 5.1 Conducting Sphere in a Uniform Electric Field (continued) We left off in the previous exercise set with the electric potential due to the conducting sphere, which as U (r, θ) = −E0 cos θ + E0a3 r2 cos θ. More so, we had recognized that the sphere’s contribution E0a3 r2 cos θ corresponded to the potential of an electric dipole. Our next step is to explore the sphere’s dipole behavior. We consider an infinitesimal element of the sphere’s surface at the angle θ carrying charge dq, on the upper hemisphere with positive charge and θ. Recall the electric field, as for any conductor, is perpendicular to the surface. We write Gauss’s law for the small surface element, which is simple because the electric field is perpendicular to the surface E⊥ dS = dq ϵ0 =⇒ de dS = σ = ϵ0E⊥. This equality gives us an expression for σ in terms of the electric field E⊥ perpendicular to the surface. We can find E⊥ from the potential: E⊥ = − ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r=a = E0 cos θ + 2E0 cos θ =⇒ σ = 3ϵ0E0 cos θ. The charge density’s dependence on θ quantitatively demonstrates the sphere’s dipole-like charge distribution. With charge density σ known, we can find the sphere’s electric dipole moment via pe = ˆ ˜r dq. We qualitatively expect pe to point upward (from the negative to the positively charged hemisphere), and confirm this analytically. By spherical symmetry, only the z component of pe is non-zero; this is pez = ˆ ˜z dq = ¨ (a cos θ) · (σ dS) = ¨ (a cos θ) · (3ϵ0E0 cos θ) · dS. To find dS, we find the area of a small band of width da around the sphere’s surface. The band’s area is 2πr da = 2π(a sin θ)(a dθ). The dipole moment pez is then pez = ˆ π 0 (3ϵ0E0a cos2 θ) · 2π(a sin θ)(a dθ) = 6a 3πϵ0E0 ˆ 1 −1 cos2 θ d[cos θ] = 6a3πϵ0E0 [ 1 3 cos3 θ]1 −1 = 4πϵ0E0a3. 21 5.2. Electric Dipole in a Conducting Spherical Shell 5.2 Electric Dipole in a Conducting Spherical Shell We place an electric dipole with dipole moment pe in the center of a conducting spherical shell of radius a. What is the electric potential inside the shell? We will work in spherical coordinates, which are best suited to the problem’s spherical symmetry. By rotational symmetry, the potential depends only on the coordinates r and θ, not ϕ. Besides at the center, the charge density inside the sphere is zero, so we solve the Laplace equation ∇2U (r, θ) = 0. The general solution is U (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 (Alrl + Blr−(l+1)) Pl(cos θ). where Pl are the Legendre polynomials. We then apply boundary conditions to find a solution specific to our problem. First, the potential on the shell’s surface is constant, since the shell is a conductor. For convenience, we’ll set U (a, θ) = 0. The second boundary condition concerns the dipole at the sphere’s center. Namely, the potential approaches the potential of an electric dipole near the sphere’s center. Quantitatively, this condition reads U (r → 0, θ) = pe cos θ 4πϵ0r2 . We begin with the simpler second boundary condition, (the boundary r → 0 eliminates the rl-dependent term). Inserted into the general solution, the second condition reads U (r → 0, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 Blr−(l+1)Pl(cos θ) = pe cos θ 4πϵ0 r−2. Note that the entire series sums to only a single term; for this to work, only the l = 1 term in the series can be non-zero, leaving B1r−2 cos θ = pe cos θ 4πϵ0 r−2 =⇒ B1 = pe 4πϵ0 and Bl̸=1 = 0. Note the use of P1(cos θ) = cos θ. The intermediate solution at this stage is U (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 AlrlPl(cos θ) + pe 4πϵ0 r−2 cos θ. We apply the second boundary condition U (a, θ) = 0 to get ∞∑ l=0 Ala lPl(cos θ) = − pe 4πϵ0 a −2 cos θ. As before, only the l = 1 term can be non-zero to satisfy the equality. The result is A1a cos θ = − pe 4πϵ0 a−2 cos θ =⇒ A1 = − pe 4πϵ0a3 and Al̸=1 = 0. 22 5.3. Point Charge Above a Conducting Plane With the coefficients Al and Bl known, the solution for U (r, θ) is U (r, θ) = [ pe 4πϵ0r2 − pe 4πϵ0a3 r] cos θ = pe cos θ 4πϵ0 [ 1 r2 − r a3 ] . The 1 r2 term is the dipole’s contribution. The r a3 comes from the charge induced on the conducting shell. The induced term is worth a closer look, noting that r cos θ = z. Uinduced = − pe 4πϵ0a3 r cos θ = − pe 4πϵ0a3 z. In particular, the associated electric field is Einduced = − ∂ ∂z Uinduced = pe 4πϵ0a3 . In other words, the electric field generated by the induced charge is constant! The uniform field also tells us about the charge distribution on the sphere’s surface: to create a uniform field in the z direction, the shell must have a dipole-like charge distribution, with positive charge on the lower hemisphere and negative charge on the upper hemisphere. Next, we’re interested in the analytic expression for the surface charge density σ. We consider a small surface element dS, and consider the total electric field at that surface. The electric field must be perpendicular to the surface, since the shell is a conductor. Gauss’s law applied to the surface element reads −E⊥ dS = dq ϵ0 =⇒ σ ≡ dq dS = −ϵ0E⊥. Note the minus sign, indicating the field’s electric flux leaving the surface element from inside the shell. We find an expression for E⊥ from U : E⊥ = − ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣r=a = + pe cos θ 4πϵ0 [ 2 r3 + 1 a3 ] r=a = 3pe 4πϵ0a3 cos θ. The associated surface charge density is σ = −ϵ0E⊥ = − 3pe 4πa3 cos θ. 5.3 Point Charge Above a Conducting Plane Consider a positive point charge q a distance d above a large, grounded conducting plane. What is the electric potential in space due to the charge-plane system? We will use a trick called the method of images to solve the problem. Namely, we imagine a negative point charge −q a distance d below the plane—a mirror image of the original positive charge. The resulting charge distribution is an electric dipole. Note: placing an imaginary negative charge a distance d below the plane does not change the field above the plane due to the positive charge. 23 5.3. Point Charge Above a Conducting Plane Considering both points, the potential at an arbitrary position r from the origin is U (r) = q 4πϵ0 1 |r − d| − q 4πϵ0 1 |r + d| , where the vector d points perpendicularly up from the plane toward the positive charge. Introducing an angle θ between d and r, we have |r ± d| = √ r2 + d2 ± 2rd cos θ. The expression for U (r) for the two charges is then simply U2(r) = q 4πϵ0 [ 1 √r2 + d2 ± 2rd cos θ − 1 √ r2 + d2 ± 2rd cos θ ] . For the original configuration of a single positive charge a distance d above the plane, the potential above the plane agrees with U2, while the potential below the plane, where there is in reality no charge, is zero. The correct expression for the single charge +q is then U (r) = { U2(r) above the plane 0 below the plane. Next, we’re interested in the surface charge density σ(ρ) on the plane where ρ is the radial distance in the plane from the origin. As usual, we start with Gauss’s law for a small surface element of the plane: −E⊥ dS = dq ϵ0 =⇒ σ ≡ dq dS = −σE⊥. To find E⊥, we differentiate U with respect to the vertical coordinate z. First, we introduce z into the expression |r ± d| |r ± d| = √ r2 + d2 ± 2rd cos θ = √ ρ2 + z2 + d2 ± 2dz. We then have U (ρ, z) = q 4πϵ0 [ 1 √ ρ2 + z2 + d2 − 2dz − 1 √ ρ2 + z2 + d2 + 2dz ] . We then find E⊥ and then σ with σ = −ϵ0E⊥ = −ϵ0 ∂U ∂z ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ z=0 = − q 4π [ d (ρ2 + d2)3/2 + d (ρ2 + d2)3/2 ] = − q 2π d (ρ2 + d2)3/2 . With surface charge density σ known, we then ask what is the total charge on the plane. Integrating the plane over rings with area dS = 2πρ dρ, we have qplane = ¨ σ dS = − ˆ ∞ 0 qd 2π(ρ2 + d2)3/2 (2πρ dρ). 24 5.3. Point Charge Above a Conducting Plane In terms of the new variable u = ρ2 + d2, the integral evaluates to qplane = − qd 2 ˆ ∞ d2 du u3/2 = qd [ 1 u1/2 ]∞ d2 = −q. Summary of what we did: recognize that the field above the plane from the positive charge looks like half the field of an electric dipole. Since we know the solution for a dipole, instead of solving the charge-plane system, we solve the (imaginary) two-charge system, which gives the same field above the plane anyway. We then reuse the upper half of the dipole solution for the single-charge plane system, and set the field below the plane equal to zero. The basic idea is: the field above the plane is the same for both the positive-charge plane system and for a dipole system, so we can use either approach to solve for the field above the plane. Next, we ask what is the electrostatic force on the point charge above the plane? First, some theory: Theory: Electrostatic Force The total electrostatic force F acting on the charges enclosed in a region of space V permeated with an electric field E is F = ϵ0 ‹ ∂V [ E(E · ˆn) − 1 2 E2 ˆn] dS, where ˆn is the normal to the surface ∂V enclosing the charges. Like with Gauss’s law, a good choice of the boundary surface, usually taking advantage of the problem’s symmetries, tends to simplify the problem. Alternatively, if the electric field vanishes at infinity, we choose a surface that closes at infinity. Back to our problem: we choose an infinite surface whose base runs along the plane, then turns upward and closes at infinity to enclose the upper half of space above the plane. The field in this case is the same E⊥ calculated above: E⊥ = q 2πϵ0 d (ρ2 + d2)3/2 . For the part of the surface running parallel to the plane, the normal to the surface ˆn points perpendicularly into the plane, parallel to the electric field. The force equation for the bottom half of the surface reads Fe = ϵ0 ¨ bottom [ E2 ˆn − 1 2 E2 ˆn] dS = ϵ0 2 ˆn ¨ bottom E2 ⊥ dS. In fact, the contribution from the upper half of the surface is zero—the upper half extends to infinity, where the electric field vanishes. We only need to integrate over the bottom of the surface, running parallel to the plane. Writing dS = 2πρ dρ and substituting in the expression for E⊥, the force reads Fe = ˆn ϵ0 2 ˆ ∞ 0 q2 4π2ϵ2 0 d2 (ρ2 + d2)3 2πρ dρ = q2d2 4πϵ0 ˆn ˆ ∞ 0 ρ (ρ2 + d2)3 dρ = q2d2 8πϵ0 ˆn ˆ ∞ d2 du u3 = − q2d2 16πϵ0 ˆn [ 1 u2 ]∞ d2 = q2 16πϵ0d2 ˆn. 25 5.3. Point Charge Above a Conducting Plane The force points in the direction of ˆn—downward into the plane. A final note: if we write Fe = q2 4πϵ0(2d)2 ˆn, the force takes the form of the electric force between a positive and negative charge separated by a distance 2d—the same situation we used in the method of images above. 26 6.1. Force on a Conducting Spherical Shell 6 Sixth Exercise Set Theory: Electrostatic Force Recall from the previous exercise set that the total electrostatic force F acting on the charges enclosed in a region of space V permeated with an electric field E is Fe = ϵ0 ‹ ∂V [E(E · ˆn) − 1 2 E2 ˆn ] dS, where ˆn is the normal to the surface ∂V enclosing the charges. 6.1 Force on a Conducting Spherical Shell We place a conducting sphere of radius a in a homogeneous electric field E0. Find the electrostatic force on the upper half of the sphere. Suppose the field points in the z direction. Recall from the previous exercise set that the potential from the sphere and electric field is U (r, θ) = −E0r cos θ + E0a3 r2 cos θ. Qualitatively, there are two main contributions to the force on the sphere: an upwards contribution in the positive z direction from the external electric field, and a downward contribution in the negative z direction from the negative charge accumulated on the bottom half of the sphere. We are interested in the force on the upper half of the sphere—the next step is to choose a surface around the sphere’s upper half that will simplify the force calculation. Recall the field points perpendicularly out of the conducting sphere’s surface at all points. With this perpendicular field in mind, choose a surface that tightly hugs the sphere’s upper half—in this case, the field and normal to the surface ˆn are parallel at all points outside the sphere. In the hemisphere plane inside the sphere, there is no field at all. These to facts simplify the dot product E · ˆn in the force equation. We then have E · ˆn = E and E(E · ˆn) = E2 ˆn. The contribution to the force on along the sphere’s outside surface is Fe = ϵ0 ¨ outer 1 2 E2 ˆn dS. The contribution from the hemisphere plane through the sphere zero, since E = 0 inside the sphere. Next, we find the magnitude E on the sphere’s surface from the potential U (r, θ). The field points radially outwards, so we differentiate U with respect to r to get E = ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣r=a = E0 cos θ + 2E0 cos θ = 3E0 cos θ. Inserting E into the force equation gives Fe = ϵ0 ¨ 1 2 (3E0 cos θ)2 ˆn dS. 27 6.2. Point Charge Between Two Conducting Plates In spherical coordinates, the unit normal ˆn to the sphere’s surface is ˆn = (sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ). The surface element dS at the surface r = a is (just like in the previous exercise sets) dS = a2 dϕ sin θ dθ. The force on the sphere’s upper half is then Fe = 9ϵ0E2 0 2 ˆ π/2 θ=0 ˆ 2π ϕ=0 cos2 θ   sin θ cos ϕ sin θ sin ϕ cos θ   (a 2 sin θ dθ dϕ). Both the x and y components will be zero—integrating cos ϕ and sin ϕ over a full period 2π give zero, while the ϕ contribution to the z component is 2π. We make this explicit with Fe = 9ϵ0E2 0 2 ˆ π/2 θ=0 cos2 θ   0 0 2π cos θ   (a 2 sin θ dθ). The non-zero z component Fz is Fz = 9ϵ0E2 0 2 ˆ π/2 θ=0 2π cos3 θ(a2 sin θ dθ) = 9πϵ0E2 0 a2 ˆ π/2 θ=0 cos3 θ(sin θ dθ) = 9πϵ0E2 0 a 2 ˆ 1 0 cos3 θ d[cos θ] = 9πϵ0a2E2 0 4 . The vector force can be written simply as F = 9πϵ0a2E2 0 4 ˆz. In other words, the force on the upper half points upward in the positive z direction. 6.2 Point Charge Between Two Conducting Plates We place two large conducting plates at a right angle to each other, so that the plates come close together but just barely do not touch. We then place a point charge q along the line bisecting the right angle between the plates, at a perpendicular distance a from each plate. Both plates are grounded. What is the electric potential in the region bounded by the plates at large distances from the plates’ intersection? Assume r = 0 along the line connecting the two plates. For a single plate, we could solve the problem with the method of images—see the previous exercise set. With two plates we proceed analogously, with a mirror image for each plate. Because of the two reflections from the two plates, we end up with three imaginary charges plus the one original one in a quadrupole arrangement. (This is hard to describe in words, it is best to see a picture). For large r, the charge arrangement will have the field of an electric quadrupole. Solving the problem thus reduces to a multipole expansion of the electric potential to the quadrupole term. 6.2.1 Theory: The Multipole Expansion The multipole expansion of U to quadrupole order, using the Einstein summation convention, is U (r) = 1 4πϵ0 [ q r + piri r3 + Qijrirj r5 ] , 28 6.2. Point Charge Between Two Conducting Plates where p is the electric dipole moment and Q is the quadrupole moment tensor. Note: we could think of the charge q is a scalar monopole moment, creating a logical progression from scalar monopole moment to vector dipole moment to tensor quadrupole moment. We find the dipole moment with p = ˚ d 3˜rρ(˜r)˜r. We find the quadrupole moment by components: Qij = ˚ d 3˜rρ(˜r) (3˜ri˜rj − δij ˜r2). The discrete analog a configuration of N charges reads Qij = N∑ n=1 qn (3rnirnj − δijr2 n) . Note that both definitions produces a symmetric tensor. Also important: the tensor’s trace—the sum of the diagonal elements is zero: tr Q = ∑ n qn [ 3x2 n − r2 n + 3z2 n − r2 n + 3z2 n − r2 n] = ∑ n qn [3r2 n − 3r2 n] = 0. 6.2.2 Returning to the original problem For our imaginary quadrupole configuration of four charges, the total charge, and thus the monopole moment, is zero. Analogously, the total dipole moment of the arrangement, which consists of two positive and two negative charges, is zero—the two dipoles cancel each other out. From the three terms in our multipole expansion of U (r), only the quadrupole term remains. We just have to calculate the quadrupole tensor Qij. We label the four charges in the imaginary quadrupole configuration as 1, 2, 3, and 4, where 1 is the original positive charge in the upper right corner, 2 is the negative image charge in the upper left corner, 3 is the positive image charge in the lower left corner, and 4 is the negative image charge in the lower right corner. Using the discrete formula for Qij, the first component Qxx is Qxx = N∑ n=1 qn (3x2 n − δijr2 n) = q (3a 2 − 2a2) + (−q) (3a2 − 2a 2) = q (3a2 − 2a 2) + (−q) (3a 2 − 2a2) = 0. The other diagonal terms Qyy and Qzz will analogously sum to zero. All off-diagonal terms with a z component are also zero, since the charges lie in a plane with z = 0. We thus have Qxz = Qzx = Qyz = Qzy = 0. We have just two 29 6.2. Point Charge Between Two Conducting Plates terms left calculate: Qxy and Qyx. By the tensor’s symmetry, the two are equal, so we really only have one term: Qxy = N∑ n=1 qn (3xnyn − 0 · r2 n) = 3qa 2 + 3(−q)(−a 2) + 3qa 2 + 3(−q)(−a 2) = 12qa 2. The quadrupole tensor is Q =   0 12qa2 0 12qa2 0 0 0 0 0   . As expected, the tensor is symmetric with trace tr Q = 0. Recall the quadrupole expansion of U (r): U (r) = 1 4πϵ0 [ q r + piri r3 + Qijrirj r5 ] . In our case, with q = 0 and p = 0, we have U (r) = 1 4πϵ0 [ 12qa2xy r5 + 12qa2yx r5 + 0 + · · · + 0] = 6qa2 πϵ0 xy r5 = 6qa2 πϵ0 cos ϕ sin ϕ sin 2 θ r3 . The second line uses the spherical coordinates x = r cos ϕ sin θ and y = r sin ϕ sin θ. In fact, the expression for U (r) takes the exact same form as the wave function of a d electron orbital (angular momentum quantum number l = 2) in a hydrogen atom. The equipotential surfaces of U (r) have the same spatial distribution as the dxy orbitals for a hydrogen wave function. 30 7.1. Theory: Magnetic Vector Potential and the Biot-Savart Law 7 Seventh Exercise Set 7.1 Theory: Magnetic Vector Potential and the Biot-Savart Law We will need to use two more Maxwell equations for magnetostatics. The first is ∇ · B = 0. This equation rules out the possibility of magnetic monopoles and allows B to be written as the curl of a vector potential A as B = ∇ × A. The second Maxwell equation is ∇ × B = µ0 (j + ϵ0 ∂E ∂t ) . For static situations with a constant electric field this simplifies to ∇ × B = µ0j. Substituting the expression B = ∇ × A into the static second Maxwell equation produces ∇ × (∇ × A ) = ∇ · (∇ · A) − ∇2A = µ0j. The magnetic vector potential is defined only up to a constant; we usually choose A so that ∇ · A = 0. In this convention, we have ∇2A = −µ0j, where j is the current density vector. This equation is a vector analog of the Poisson equation ∇2U = − ρ ϵ0 from electrostatics. Similarly to how the electrostatic potential U at a point r in region of space with charge density ρ is found with U = 1 4πϵ0 ˚ ρ(˜r) d3˜r |r − ˜r| , the magnetic potential at a point r in region of space with current density j is A(r) = µ0 4π ˚ j(˜r) d3˜r |r − ˜r| . In problems involving one-dimensional conductors, where j is non-zero only along the conductor, the expression for j(˜r) d3˜r simplifies to j(˜r) d 3˜r = j(˜r) d ˜S d˜l = I ˆt d˜l, where ˆt is the unit normal vector tangent to the conductor, I is the current through the conductor at the point ˜r and d˜l is a small distance element along the conductor’s 31 7.2. Magnetic Field of a Circular Current Loop length. The magnetic vector potential for a one-dimensional conductor carrying a current I then simplifies to A(r) = µ0I 4π ˆ ˆt dl |r − ˜r| . Recall B = ∇ × A. Taking the curl of the general expression for A in terms of current density j gives general expression for the magnetic field B(r) = µ0 4π ˆ j(˜r) × (r − ˜r) |r − ˜r| 3 d 3˜r. This is a general form of the Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field B of a current distribution. 7.2 Magnetic Field of a Circular Current Loop A closed conducting loop of radius a carries current I. What is the magnetic vector potential far from the conducting loop? Our starting point is the vector potential of a one-dimensional conductor from the theory section, i.e. A(r) = µ0I 4π ˆ ˆt dl |r − ˜r| . We need expressions for r, ˜r and ˆt. Assume the loop lies in the x, y plane with the z axis normal to the loop. For mathematical convenience, we rotate the x, y plane so r lies in the x, z plane (i.e. ϕ = 0); this just gives us one less non-zero component to work with, since the sin ϕ term in the y component of r is zero. In polar coordinates r reads r = (r sin θ, 0, r cos θ) , where θ is the angle between r and the z axis. The integration variable ˜r, which runs over the current loop in the x, y plane, reads ˜r = (a cos ˜ϕ, a sin ˜ϕ, 0 ), where ˜ϕ is the azimuthal angle between ˜r and the x axis. Finally, the expression for ˆt, the tangent to the current loop, is ˆt = ( − sin ˜ϕ, cos ˜ϕ, 0 ). The small distance element is d˜l = a ˜ϕ . We can now put the pieces together in the equation for A. First, |r − ˜r| = √ (r sin θ − a cos ˜ϕ)2 + a2 sin 2 ˜ϕ + r2 cos2 θ = √ r2 + a2 − 2ra sin θ cos ˜ϕ ≈ √ r2 − 2ra sin θ cos ˜ϕ = r √ 1 − 2a r sin θ cos ˜ϕ, 32 7.3. Magnetic Field of a Rotating Charged Disk where the last lines uses r ≫ a (recall we’re interested in the solution far from the conducting loop). We now have, again using a ≪ r =⇒ a r ≪ 1, 1 |r − ˜r| = 1 r ( 1 − 2a r sin θ cos ˜ϕ)−1/2 ≈ 1 r ( 1 + 1 2 2a r sin θ cos ˜ϕ) . Substituting the expressions for 1 |r−˜r| , ˆt and d˜l into expression for A gives A(r) = µ0I 4π ˆ ˆt dl |r − ˜r| = µ0I 4π a r ˆ 2π 0 d ˜ϕ   − sin ˜ϕ cos ˜ϕ 0   (1 + 1 2 2a r sin θ cos ˜ϕ) . The integrals conveniently simplify, since we are integrating sinusoidal terms over an entire period. Only the integral of cos2 ˜ϕ in the y component is nonzero. We end up with Ax = Az = 0 and Ay(r) = µ0I 4π a r ˆ 2π 0 a sin θ r cos2 ˜ϕ d ˜ϕ = µ0I 4 a2 r2 sin θ, or, in vector form, A(r) = µ0I 4 a2 r2 sin θ ˆy = µ0I 4 a2 r2 ˆz × ˆr. The second expression is preferable: the first, in terms of ˆy, holds only with x, y plane rotated so ϕ = 0 and r lies in the x, z plane. The second, which uses sin θ ˆy = ˆz × ˆr, holds for any orientation of the x, y plane. Finally, using Iπa2 = |m| (where m is the loop’s magnetic dipole moment, which points in the direction of the loop’s normal), the expression for A simplifies to A(r) = µ0m × ˆr 4πr2 = µ0m × r 4πr3 . This is the same form of magnetic vector potential as for a magnetic dipole. In other words, a circular current loop behaves as magnetic dipole at long distances. 7.3 Magnetic Field of a Rotating Charged Disk Consider a charged, insulating disk with uniform surface charge density σ and radius a. The disk rotates uniformly about an axis through its center with constant angular speed ω. Find the magnetic field along the axis of rotation. We choose a coordinate system so the disk lies in the x, y plane and the rotation axis coincides with the z axis, so ω = (0, 0, ω). Start with the general Biot-Savart law B(r) = µ0 4π ˚ j(˜r) × (r − ˜r) |r − ˜r|3 d 3˜r, and, like in the previous problem, find expressions for each vector quantity in the equation. The expression for r along the z axis is simply r = (0, 0, z), while the expression for ˜r, which lies in the disk in the x, y plane, is ˜r = (˜r cos ˜ϕ, ˜r sin ˜ϕ, 0 ). 33 7.3. Magnetic Field of a Rotating Charged Disk The difference of r and ˜r and its magnitude is r − ˜r = ( − ˜r cos ˜ϕ, −˜r sin ˜ϕ, z) and |r − ˜r| = √˜r2 + z2. Finally, the current density j, which points tangent to the disk’s rotation, is j = j(− sin ˜ϕ, cos ˜ϕ, 0). Using the expressions for our vector quantities, the cross product j(˜r) × (r − ˜r) is j(˜r) × (r − ˜r) = j   − sin ˜ϕ cos ˜ϕ 0     −˜r cos ˜ϕ −˜r sin ˜ϕ z   = j   z cos ˜ϕ z sin ˜ϕ ˜r   . Substituting j(˜r) × (r − ˜r) and |r − ˜r| into the Biot-Savart law gives B(z) = µ0 4π ˚ j d3˜r (˜r2 + z2)3/2   z cos ˜ϕ z sin ˜ϕ ˜r   . Next, we write j d3˜r = j d ˜S d˜l = j d ˜S(˜r d ˜ϕ) = dI ˜r d ˜ϕ. Note that the product j d ˜S is the current element dI in the surface element d ˜S. The current dI at the radius ˜r on the disk rotating with period t0 = 2π ω is dI = dq t0 = dq 2π ω = (σ2π˜r d˜r) 2π ω = σω˜r d˜r. Substituting j d3˜r = dI ˜r d ˜ϕ = σω˜r2 d˜r d ˜ϕ into the Biot-Savart law gives B(z) = µ0 4π ˆ a 0 d˜r ˆ 2π 0 d ˜ϕ σω˜r2 (˜r2 + z2)3/2   z cos ˜ϕ z sin ˜ϕ ˜r   . The first and second components of B contain integrals cos and sin terms over a full period—the result is zero. After integrating over ˜ϕ, the magnetic field simplifies to B(z) = µ0 4π ˆ a 0 d˜r σω˜r2 (˜r2 + z2)3/2   0 0 2π˜r   . Only the z component of B is non-zero; it is Bz(z) = µ0 2 ˆ a 0 d˜r σω˜r3 (˜r2 + z2)3/2 . In terms of the new variable u = ˜r2 + z2, the integral evaluates to Bz(z) = µ0 2 σω 2 ˆ z2+a2 z2 u − z2 u3/2 du = µ0σω 4 [ 2u 1/2 + 2z2u −1/2]z2+a2 a2 = µ0σω 2 (√ z2 + a2 − z + z2 √z2 + a2 − z) = µ0σω 2 ( 2z2 + a2 √z2 + a2 − 2z) . 34 7.3. Magnetic Field of a Rotating Charged Disk The magnetic field along the z axis is thus B = (0, 0, Bz) with Bz as above. Next, we consider the limit case z ≫ a, far from the rotating disk. Expanding the square root to fourth order in the small quantity a z , multiplying out and simplifying like terms gives Bz = µ0σω 2   2z2 + a2 z√1 + a2 z2 − 2z   ≈ µ0σω 2 [( 2z + a2 z ) ( 1 − a2 2z2 + 3 8 a4 z4 ) − 2z] = µ0σω 2 [2z + a2 z − a2 z − 1 2 a4 z3 + 3 4 a4 z3 + 3 8 a6 z5 − 2z] = µ0σω 2 [ 1 4 a4 z3 + 3 8 a6 z5 ] . Neglecting the highest-order a6 z5 term gives the simple result Bz ≈ µ0σω 8 a4 z3 , z ≫ a. In other words, far from the disk, the magnetic field falls off as z−3, just like the field of a magnetic dipole. Next, we will try to write the magnetic field in the form Bz ∝ |m| z3 where m is the disk’s magnetic dipole moment. Integrating over concentric rings with area S carrying current dI, the disk’s magnetic dipole moment is |m| = ˆ S dI = ˆ a 0 (π˜r2) · (σω˜r d˜r) = πσω ˆ a 0 ˜r3 d˜r = π 4 σωa 4. Comparing this expression for |m| to the similar expression for Bz leads to Bz ≈ µ0σω 8 a4 z3 = µ0|m| 2πz3 , which is in the desired form Bz ∝ |m| z3 . The general form for the magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is B(r) = µ0 4π 3(m · r)r − mr2 r5 . In fact, this expression is equivalent to our result Bz(z) = µ0|m| 2πz3 . Since m and r both point along the z axis, their dot product is m · r = |m|r. Along the z axis, r = (0, 0, z) and the general expression for the dipole magnetic field simplifies to B(r) = µ0 4π 3|m|z2 − |m|z2 z5 ˆz = µ0|m| 2πz3 ˆz, in agreement with our expression for Bz for z ≫ a. 35 8.1. Magnetic Force in a Coaxial Cable 8 Eighth Exercise Set Theory: Magnetic Force The magnetic force F on the matter contained in the region of space enclosed in the region V and permeated by the magnetic field B is F = 1 µ0 ‹ ∂V [B(B · ˆn) − 1 2 B 2 ˆn ] dS, where ˆn is the normal vector to the region’s boundary ∂V . 8.1 Magnetic Force in a Coaxial Cable A long coaxial cable consists of a thin inner wire and outer sheath with radius a. The inner wire carries a current I, and we connect the sheath to the inner wire at the cable’s ends so that the current I returns along the outer sheath in the opposite direction as the current along the inner wire. Find the magnetic force per unit length on the outer sheath. There are two contributions to the magnetic force on the sheath: the repulsive, radially outward force between the sheath and the inner wire and an attractive “surface tension” force distributed across the sheath’s surface, which carries uniformly distributed current I (think of the sheath as a collection of parallel conducting wires, which attract each other). Consider one-half of the sheath, which forms a semicircular cross section. There are downward forces F1 at end of the semicircle and an upward magnetic force Fm acting on the top of the sheath. In equilibrium, the forces are related by Fm = 2F1. First, we find the magnetic field in the conductor. Inside the sheath, Ampere’s law with a circular path encircling the inner wire reads ˛ B · dl = µ0I =⇒ B(2πr) = µ0I =⇒ B = µ0I 2πr . Outside the conductor, the net current enclosed by a circular path encircling both the outer sheath and inner wire is zero, and the Ampere’s law reads ˛ B · dl = µ0(+I − I) = 0 =⇒ B = 0. In other words, there is no magnetic field outside the conductor. With the coaxial cable’s magnetic field known, we now find the magnetic force Fm on a semi-circular half of the outer sheath. Fm = 1 µ0 ‹ ∂V [B(B · ˆn) − 1 2 B2 ˆn ] dS. We choose an integration surface tightly hugging the half-sheath and work in cylindrical coordinates r, ϕ. Outside the sheath, the magnetic field is zero and there is no 36 8.2. Tension in a Toroidal Inductor contribution to Fm. Inside the sheath, the magnetic field is tangent to the semicircle, so B · ˆn = 0, and the force integral reads Fm = 1 µ0 ¨ [ 0 − 1 2 B2 ˆn] dS. The magnetic field at along the sheath (where r = a) is constant and equal to B = µ0I 2πa and can be moved outside the integral. The normal vector in cylindrical coordinates reads ˆn = (− cos ϕ, − sin ϕ, 0), while the surface element is dS = al dϕ. The force integral reads Fm = − 1 2 µ0I 2 4π2a2 ˆ π 0   − cos ϕ − sin ϕ 0   la dϕ. The x component with cos ϕ integrates to zero over ϕ ∈ [0, π]. Only the y component is nonzero, and the vector force reads Fm = + 1 2 µ0I 2 4π2a2 (2al) ˆy = µ0I 2l 4π2a ˆy. The forces F1 at the two ends of the semicircle are then F1 = Fm 2 = µ0I 2l 8π2a =⇒ F l = µ0I 2 8π2a . 8.2 Tension in a Toroidal Inductor A toroidal inductor with N coils radius r1 and cross-sectional radius r2 carries a current I. Find the tension force on a single coil if r1 ≫ r2. First, we find the magnetic field inside the inductor with Ampere’s law using a closed circular path of radius r ∈ (r1, r1 + r2) in the inductor’s equatorial plane. Ampere’s law reads Bin(2πr) = µ0(N I) =⇒ Bin = µ0N I 2πr . Outside the inductor, with a circular path of radius r > r1 + r2 in the inductor’s equatorial plane, Ampere’s law reads Bout(2πr) = µ0(N I + N (−I)) = 0 =⇒ Bout = 0. Consider a semicircular half of a single inductor coil. As in the previous problem, the magnetic force with magnitude Fm acts upwards on the top of the semicircle, while two “surface tension” forces F1 = Fm 2 act downward at the semicircle’s two ends. As usual, we find the magnetic force Fm using Fm = 1 µ0 ‹ ∂V [B(B · ˆn) − 1 2 B2 ˆn ] dS. 37 8.3. Resistance of a Thin Conducting Plate For the integration surface (awkward to describe, best to see a picture) we choose a surface that looks like a coin cut in half, basically a thin three-dimensional extension of a semicircle enclosing the coil’s semicircular upper half. We split the surface into four parts: the left and right semicircular faces, the circular ribbon along the surface’s outer radius, and the thin rectangular plane along the surface’s bottom. The circular upper ribbon occurs just outside the inductor coil (where B = 0) and thus does not contribute the magnetic force. The left and right semicircular faces have equal magnitude and opposite-sign contributions, since the normal to the surface changes sign for each face. Only the rectangular plane has a nonzero contribution to Fm. Under the assumption r1 ≫ r2, the magnetic field along the plane simplifies to B = ˆ r1+r2 r1 µ0N I 2π˜r d˜r ≈ µ0N I 2πr1 . The magnetic field B points along the toroid’s longitudinal axis (into the plane of a cross-sectional coil) and is perpendicular to the normal ˆn to the planar integration surface, so ˆB · ˆn = 0. The magnetic force simplifies to Fm = 1 µ0 [0 − 1 2 B2 ˆn] dS = − 1 2µ0 ( µ0N I 2πr1 )2 ˆn ¨ dS = − 1 2µ0 ( µ0N I 2πr1 )2 ˆn ( r2 2πr1 N ) = − µ0N I 2 2π r2 r1 ˆn. The unit vector ˆn points downward, so − ˆn and thus Fm point upward and pull the coil apart. The magnitude of the tension on the coil is then F1 = Fm 2 = µ0N I 2 4π r2 r1 . 8.3 Resistance of a Thin Conducting Plate Consider a conducting plate consisting of half of a thin annulus with inner radius r1, outer radius r2, thickness h and conductivity σ, with electrodes placed at each end. Find the plate’s electric resistance R when we es- tablish a potential difference U0 between the electrodes at the plate’s ends. We first find the current density in the con- ducting plate using Ohm’s law j = σE, where j and E are the current density and electric field in the conductor. We write j in terms of the continuity equation ∇ · j + ∂ρ ∂t = 0. 38 8.3. Resistance of a Thin Conducting Plate For a stationary charge distribution, we have ∇ · j = 0. We then take the divergence of both sides of the equation j = σE = ρ and apply E = −∇U to get ∇ · j = σ∇ · E = −σ∇2U = ∇ · j = 0 =⇒ ∇ 2U = 0. We end up with a Laplace equation for U in the conductor. The plan is to find U (r), then E(r), then j via j = σE, then I and finally resistance with R = U I . The general solution of the Laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates (including the m = 0 term) is U (r, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=1 [ Am cos(mϕ) + Bm sin(mϕ)] · [ Cmrm + Dmr−m] + (aϕ + b)(c ln r + d). To find a unique solution, we need boundary conditions for our particular problem. At the first electrode at ϕ = 0, the electric potential is constant; we’ll set U (r, 0) = 0 for convenience. At the second electrode, the potential is U (r, π) = −U0 to make a potential difference U0 between electrodes (we choose −U0 so the current runs in the direction of increasing ϕ). Along the annulus’s semicircular boundaries the electric field must be tangent to the surface to satisfy ∇ · j = 0. Along these surfaces the radial component of both j and E is zero; Er = 0 gives the boundary condition Er = − ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r1,r2 = 0. The general solution for U (r, ϕ) satisfies the boundary condition ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ r1,r2 = 0 for all ϕ only if Cm = Dm = c = 0 (try finding ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ r1,r2 to see for yourself). With Cm = Dm = c = 0, the expression for U (r, ϕ) simplifies to U (r, ϕ) = (aϕ + b)d ≡ ˜aϕ + ˜b. The boundary condition U (r, 0) = 0 gives U (r, 0) ≡= 0 + ˜b =⇒ ˜b = 0. The final boundary condition U (r, π) = −U0 gives U (r, π) ≡= −U0 =⇒ ˜a = − U0 π =⇒ U (r, ϕ) = − U0 π ϕ. In other words, the electric potential is a linear function of ϕ. With U (r, ϕ) known, we find the tangential electric field Et with Et = − 1 r ∂U ∂ϕ = U0 πr , from which we find the tangential current density jt with jt = σEt = σU0 πr . 39 8.3. Resistance of a Thin Conducting Plate We find the total current I from the current density via I = ¨ jt dS = ˆ r2 r1 ( σU0 πr ) · h dr = σU0h π ln r2 r1 , where h is the plate’s thickness. The electrical resistance is then R = U0 I = π σh ln r2 r1 . 40 9.1. Mutual Inductance 9 Ninth Exercise Set Theory: Inductance Inductance is the proportionality constant between magnetic flux Φ and current I. For a single object, e.g. a current loop, the relationship between Φ and I reads Φ1 = L11I1, where the quantity L11 is called self-inductance. For a system of two current-carrying loops, where the current through one loop generates a magnetic field and thus magnetic flux through the second loop, and vice versa, the relationships between Φ and I read Φ1 = L12I2 and Φ2 = L21I1, where the quantities L12 and L21 are the loops’ mutual inductances. Without derivation, we state that L12 = L21 for reasons of symmetry. 9.1 Mutual Inductance Consider two long, parallel wires of length l separated by a distance d ≪ l and connected at their endpoints to form a long conduct- ing loop. We place a square frame with side length √2d between the wires and sup- ply the frame with an alternating current source I1 = I10 sin ωt. Find the system’s mu- tual inductivity and the induced current in the wires. Neglect Ohmic losses, and assume a ≪ d where a is the wires’ radius. Finding Mutual Inductance We label the frame as object 1 and the wires as object 2 and introduce a coordinate y separating the parallel wires so that the bottom wire occurs at y = 0 and the top wire at y = d. To find the system’s mutual inductance L12, we consider the hypothetical magnetic flux Φ1 through the frame due to a current I2 in the parallel wires. We then find L12 with L12 = Φ1 I2 . If the parallel wires carry a current I2 (in opposite directions, since they form a closed loop), the corresponding magnetic field is B = µ0I2 2π ( 1 y + 1 d − y ) = µ0I2 2π d y(d − y) . We find magnetic flux with Φ = ´ B · dS; the dot product drops because B is parallel to the frame’s cross section dS. The square frame’s surface element is dS = 2y dy 41 9.1. Mutual Inductance (the frame’s width is 2y), and the magnetic flux through the square frame is Φ1 = ¨ B dS = 2 ˆ d/2 0 µ0I2d 2π 2y dy y(d − y) = − 2µ0I2d π ln(d − y) ∣ ∣d/2 0 = 2µ0I2d π [ ln d − ln d 2 ] = 2µ0d ln 2 π I2. Note the use of symmetry—we integrate only from 0 to d/2 and multiply by two. The mutual inductance—the proportionality between Φ and I2 is L12 = Φ1 I2 = 2 ln 2 π µ0d. Note that L12 depends only on system’s geometry. Induced Current in the Parallel Wires Recall the square frame carries an alternating current I1(t) = I10 sin ωt, so we expect the induced current I2(t) in the parallel wires to alternate with the same frequency ω and a general form I2(t) = I20 sin(ωt). We will find the ratio of current amplitudes I20/I10. We’ll solve the problem as follows: use the frame current I1 to find the magnetic flux Φ2 through the parallel wires, then use Φ2 to find induced voltage U2 in the wires, and finally use U2 to find the induced current I2. We find Φ2 from Φ2 = L21I1 and the symmetry relation L12 = L21, i.e. Φ2 = L21I1 = L12I1, where L12 was found the first part of the problem. We then find U2 with U12 = − ˙Φ2 = −L12 ˙I1. Next, we find I2 from U2 from the general circuit equation U = RI + Ls ˙I, which relates the voltage in a loop of resistance R and self-inductance Ls to the current I through the loop. In our case, neglecting resistance, we have U12 ≈ L22 ˙I2, where L22 is the parallel wire’s self-inductance. Substituting U12 into the earlier expression U12 = −L12 ˙I1 gives −L12 ˙I1 = L22 ˙I2. 42 9.2. The Cabrera Experiment and Magnetic Monopoles If we assume both I1 and I2 are sinusoidal with amplitudes I10 and I20, the above reduces to I20 I10 = L12 L22 . What about the minus sign? To find the current amplitude ratio, we just need to find the parallel wires self- inductance L22 using Φ2 = L22I2 If we send a hypothetical current current I2 through the wires, the corresponding magnetic field is, as before, B = µ0I2 2π ( 1 y + 1 d − y ) . The field and surface are parallel, so B · dS = B dS, and the magnetic flux is Φ2 = ¨ B dS = µ0I2ld 2π ˆ d−a a ( 1 y + 1 d − y ) dy, where a is the wire’s radius. The integral evaluates to Φ2 = µ0I2l 2π [ln d − a a − ln a d − a ] = µ0I2l π ln d − a a . Applying d ≫ a we have Φ2 = µ0I2l π ln d a . The self-inductance—the proportionality constant between Φ2 and I2—is thus L22 = µ0l π ln d a . With L22 known, we return to the current amplitude ratio to get I20 I10 = 2 ln 2 π µ0d µ0l π ln d a = 2 ln 2 l d ln d a . To get a better feel for the numbers involved, if we assume l/d = d/a = 10, we have I20 I10 ≈ 0.06. 9.2 The Cabrera Experiment and Magnetic Monopoles Consider a superconducting current loop with non-zero inductance L, radius a and a built-in ammeter. Assume a magnetic monopole passes through the loop along the axis of symmetry. Find the resulting current pulse in the loop. First, the magnetic field of a hypothetical monopole is B(r) = µ0g 4π r r3 , 43 9.2. The Cabrera Experiment and Magnetic Monopoles where g is the “magnetic charge”, with units A m. Our plan is to find the magnetic flux through the loop, use this to find voltage induced in the loop, use the induced voltage to find current. Let d(t) be the monopole’s perpendicular distance from the loop’s center, and let ρ denote radial distance from the current loop’s center (in the plane of the loop). The magnetic field magnitude a distance r from the monopole is B = µ0 4π g r2 = µ0g 4π 1 d2 + ρ2 . We find the magnetic field component B⊥ perpendicular to the current loop with similar triangles: B⊥ = d √ d2 + ρ2 B = µ0gd 4π 1 (ρ2 + d2)3/2 . The magnetic flux Φ through the loop, using dS = 2πρ dρ, is Φ = ¨ B⊥ dS = µ0gd 2 ˆ a 0 ρ dρ (ρ2 + d2)3/2 = µ0gd 4 (−2) 1 √ρ2 + d2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ a 0 = µ0g 2 ( 1 − d √a2 + d2 ) . We assume the monopole moves with constant speed v and passes through the loop’s center at t = 0. On the left of the loop (and thus for negative time), the monopole’s perpendicular distance from the loop is d(t) = −vt. The time-dependent flux on the left of the loop is thus Φ(t) = µ0g 2 ( 1 + vt √a2 + v2t2 ) . On the right of loop (and for positive time), the distance from the loop is d = vt, and thus the magnetic flux through the loop is Φ(t) = − µ0g 2 ( 1 − vt √a2 + v2t2 ) . Note the additional minus sign, since on the right of the loop, once the particle passes through, the magnetic flux points in the opposite direction. Note that Φ(t) increases from 0 at t → −∞ to a maximum value of µ0g 2 as t → 0 from the left. As the particle passes through the loop at t = 0, Φ jumps discontinuously to − µ0g 2 , and then decreases back to 0 as t → ∞. Next, we find the induced voltage in the loop. We begin with a modified Maxwell equation: ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t − µ0jm, 44 9.2. The Cabrera Experiment and Magnetic Monopoles where jm is magnetic current density and accounts for the possible existence of magnetic monopoles. We then use this modified Maxwell equation to re-derive the law of induction in the presence of magnetic monopoles. We integrate the equation over the loop’s surface to get ¨ S(∇ × E) dS = − ∂ ∂t ¨ S B · dS − µ0 ¨ S jm dS. We then apply Stokes’ theorem, which leads to ˛ E · dl = Ui = − ˙Φ − µ0Im, where Im is magnetic current through the loop’s cross section and Ui is the induced voltage in the loop. The magnetic current through the loop is nonzero only at the singular instant when the magnetic monopole passes through, which we model with the delta function: Im = gδ(t), where δ(t) has units s−1. If we neglect resistive and capacitive effects, the loop’s circuit equation reads Ui = L ˙I. Substituting in Ui = − ˙Φ − µ0Im gives Ui = Ui = − ˙Φ − µ0Im = − ˙Φ − µ0gδ(t) = L ˙I. We then integrate this equation over time to get L ˆ t −∞ ˙I d˜t = − ˆ t −∞ ˙Φ d˜t − µ0g ˆ t −∞ δ(˜t) d˜t LI(˜t)∣ ∣ ∣ t −∞ = −Φ(˜t) ∣ ∣ ∣t −∞ − µ0gH(t), where H(t) is the Heaviside step function. Since I(t → −∞) = Φ(t → −∞) = 0 (when the monopole is infinitely far from the loop), the equation reduces to LI(t) = −Φ(t) − µ0gH(t). Remember that Φ changes from µ0g 2 to − µ0g 2 as the monopole passes through the loop at t = 0. The discontinuity in Φ is exactly balanced by the Heaviside step function activating with magnitude µ0g at t = 0, and the effect is that LI(t) and thus the current through the loop is as a continuous, measurable quantity. If we use the Dirac quantization of magnetic charge, which reads µ0ge0 2 = h =⇒ µ0g = 2h e0 , we get a numerical result for the quantity µ0g, and a theoretically expected value value of LI(t). 45 10.1. Skin Effect in a Ribbon-Like Conductor 10 Tenth Exercise Set 10.1 Skin Effect in a Ribbon-Like Conductor Consider a long conducting ribbon of con- ductivity σ, width a, height b and length l where l ≫ b ≫ a. We place ideal electrodes at each end of the ribbon, and connect the electrodes to an alternating voltage source with frequency ω. Find the dependence of the conductor’s impedance on frequency and investigate the high- and low-frequency limits. Our plan is to solve for the electric field E(t) in the ribbon, use E to find the potential difference U , and finally use U to find the ribbon’s impedance. We begin with the rel- evant Maxwell equations, which are ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t ∇ · E = 0 ∇ × B = µ0j + ϵ0µ0 ∂E ∂t ∇ · B = 0. Note that ∇ · E = 0 because the conductor is neutral—no electric field escapes. We make a quasi-static approximation to simplify the equations, neglecting the displacement current ϵ0µ0 ∂E ∂t to get ∇ × B ≈ µ0j. We take the curl of the first Maxwell equation to get ∇ × (∇ × E) = ∇(∇ · E) − ∇2E = − ∂ ∂t ∇ × B. We then apply ∇ · E = 0 and ∇ × B = µ0j = µ0(σE) to get −∇2E = − ∂ ∂t µ0σE. Since the ribbon is attached to an alternating voltage source, the electric field E = E(t) reads E(t) = E0e iωt =⇒ ∂ ∂t E(t) = iωE(t). Finally, we substitute the ∂E ∂t into the earlier equation −∇2E = − ∂ ∂t µ0σE to get ∇2E − iωµ0σE ≡ ∇ 2E − k2E = 0, where we have defined the amplitude k2 ≡ iωµ0σ =⇒ k = √ iωµ0σ = 1 + i √2 √ωµ0σ. 46 10.1. Skin Effect in a Ribbon-Like Conductor Next, we define coordinate system whose x axis aligns with the ribbon’s width a and whose y axis aligns with the ribbon’s height. The conductor’s length corresponds to the z axis. We choose the origin so that x ∈ [−a/2, a/2], meaning the ribbon’s center occurs at x = 0. With respect to this coordinate system, we can then simplify the Laplacian ∇2E. Since the ribbon’s width a is much smaller than the height and length, the Laplacian’s derivatives with respect to y and z are negligible, i.e. ∇2E = ( ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 + ∂2 ∂z2 ) E ≈ ∂2E ∂x2 . The alternating voltage is applied along the conductor’s length—along the z axis—so the electric field reads E = Ez(x) ˆz. Plugging all of these simplifications into the amplitude equation gives ∇2E − k2E ≈ ∂2 ∂x2 [Ez(x) ˆz ] − k2Ez(x) ˆz = E′′ z (x) − k2Ez(x) = 0. The solutions to the equation E′′ z − k2Ez = 0 can be written either as exponents or hyperbolic functions; we will use hyperbolic functions, which are best suited to the problem’s reflection symmetry about the y axis. The general solution is Ez(x) = A cosh kx + B sinh kx. However, the problem’s reflection symmetry means Ez will have only the even component cosh, and the solution simplifies to Ez(x) = A cosh kx. We find A from the problem’s boundary conditions. Assuming Ez(±a/2) = E0, we have A cosh (± ka 2 ) = A cosh ka 2 = E0 =⇒ A = E0 cosh ka 2 . With the constant A known, the solution for Ez(x) is then Ez(x) = A cosh kx = E0 cosh kx cosh ka 2 . Next, we draw some qualitative sketches of E(x) with k as a parameter. The resulting curves show that as k (and thus frequency ω) increases, E(x) becomes concentrated near the ribbon’s outer surfaces x = ±a/2. This is a qualitative demonstration of the skin effect, where electric field and current become concentrated along a conductor’s surface at high frequencies. Potential Difference, Current and Impedance Next, with Ez(x) known, the potential difference across the ribbon’s is simply Uz(x) = Ez(x)l, 47 10.1. Skin Effect in a Ribbon-Like Conductor where l is the conductor length. With potential difference known, we find the current through the conductor with I = ¨ j dS = ¨ (σEz) dS = σE0 cosh ka 2 ˆ a/2 −a/2 cosh(kx)(b dx), where we have written the surface element dS = b dx in terms of the conductor’s height b. The integral evaluates to I = σE0b cosh ka 2 ˆ a/2 −a/2 cosh(kx) dx = σE0b cosh ka 2 · 2 k · sinh kx∣ ∣ ∣a/2 x=0 = 2σE0b k tanh ka 2 . Next, we introduce the dimensionless quantity κ = ka 2 and substitute in U0 = E0l to get I = σU0ba l 2 ka tanh ka 2 = σU0ba l tanh κ κ = U0 R0 tanh κ κ , where, in the last equality, we have substituted in the conductor’s static resistance R0 = l σS . In terms of R0, the conductor’s impedance is then Z ≡ U0 I = R0 κ tanh κ . High and Low Frequency Limits In the low frequency limit, k and thus κ are small (κ ≪ 1) and we expand the tanh x ≈ function to get Z ≈ R0 κ κ = R0. In other words, the ribbon’s impedance approaches the static resistance R0. Finally, for large frequencies and thus κ ≫ 1, we use the asymptotic expansion tanh x ≈ 1 to get Z ≈ R0κ = R0a 2 k = R0a 2 √ σµ0ω 2 (1 + i). The real component Re Z corresponds to resistance R(ω), while the imaginary com- ponent Im Z corresponds to reactance. Reactance is out of phase with resistance by π/2. At high frequencies, the resistance is R(ω) = r0a 2 √ σµ0ω 2 . Note the relationship R ∝ √ω, meaning resistance increases with frequency, since the electric field is more concentrated at the conductor edges (the “skin”) and the current has a smaller effective cross section and thus larger resistance. 48 10.2. Theory: Conservation of Electromagnetic Energy 10.2 Theory: Conservation of Electromagnetic Energy Conservation of electromagnetic energy is written as the energy balance ∂w ∂t + ∇ · S + j · E = 0, where w is electromagnetic energy density w = 1 2 (ϵ0E2 + 1 µ0 B2) and S is the Poynting vector, defined as S = 1 µ0 E × B = E × H. In integral form for a region of space V , the energy equation reads ∂ ∂t ˚ V w dV + ‹ ∂V S · dS + ˚ V j · E dV = 0, where we have used the divergence theorem to convert the Poynting vector term to a surface integral. • The w term corresponds to the changing electromagnetic field energy within the region V • The S term encodes energy flow (power) through the surface • The j · E term corresponds to Ohmic energy losses within the region. 10.3 Power in a Coaxial and Cylindrical Conductor Find the electromagnetic energy flow (power) through: 1. The cross section of a coaxial cable with inner and outer radii a and b, respec- tively, and carrying current I, of length l, with potential difference U between the inner and outer conductor. Neglect resistive losses. 2. The lateral surface of a long, straight cylindrical conductor of radius a, length l, conductivity σ and carrying a current I with a potential difference U between the cylinder ends. Lossless Coaxial Conductor In a coaxial cable, the magnetic field B points tangent to the circular cross section (perpendicular to the radial direction), while the electric field E points radially outward. We assume positive charge accumulates on the inner conductor and negative charge on the outer conductor. We find the magnetic field with Ampere’s law using a loop around the inner conductor. The result is µ0I = B · 2πr =⇒ B = µ0I 2πr . 49 10.3. Power in a Coaxial and Cylindrical Conductor Meanwhile, we find electric field with Gauss’s law, using a cylinder enclosing the inner conductor: Q = ϵ0E · 2πrl =⇒ E = Q 2πϵ0lr . The induced charge Q and potential difference between the inner and outer conductor are related by U = ˆ b a E dr = Q 2πϵ0l ln b a . In terms of U , the electric field is thus E = Q 2πϵ0lr = U r ln b a . The Poynting vector points in the direction E × B, along the conductor’s longitudinal axis. In our case we have E ⊥ B, so the Poynting vector magnitude S is S = 1 µ0 EB = 1 µ0 ( µ0I 2πr ) ( U r ln b a ) = U I 2π ln b a r2 . The electromagnetic power through the cross section is thus P = ¨ S · dS = ¨ S dS = ˆ b a ( U I 2π ln b a r2 ) (2πr dr) = U I ln b a ˆ b a dr r = U I ln b a ln b a = U I, where S · dS = S dS because S is parallel to coaxial cable’s cross section. Cylindrical Conductor As for the coaxial cable, the cylindrical conductor’s magnetic field is tangent to the conductor’s circular cross section. Meanwhile, the electric field points in the direction of the potential difference—along the conductor’s longitudinal axis. The Poynting vector S = E × B thus along the radial direction. We choose I to flow so that S points radially inward towards the conductor’s center (as opposed to radially outward for an opposite current). The electric field in the conductor, which arises from the potential difference U between the conductor’s ends, is simply E = U l , where l is the conductor’s length. We find the conductor’s magnetic field with Ampere’s law, using a circular loop centered along the conductor’s longitudinal axis. Assuming current is uniformly distributed across the cross section, the magnetic field is B · (2πr) = µ0I ( r a )2 =⇒ B = µ0I 2πa2 r. 50 10.4. Cylindrical Conductor with a Slit Since E and B is perpendicular, the Poynting vector is S = 1 µ0 EB = 1 µ0 ( U L ) ( µ0I 2πa2 r) = U I 2πa2l r. Note that S increases linearly with r. We find electromagnetic power by integrating S over the cylinder’s lateral surface (not the cross section!). The power through a lateral surface at radius r is P (r) = ¨ Slat S · dS = ¨ Slat S dS = ( U I 2πa2l r) (2πrl) = U Ir2 a2 . The power through the entire conductor’s lateral surface occurs at r = a, which produces the familiar result P = U Ia2 a2 = U I. Next, we consider the conductor’s energy balance − ∂ ∂t ˚ V w dV = ‹ ∂V S · dS + ˚ V j · E dV = P + ˚ V j · E dV. Because the situation is stationary we have ∂w ∂t = 0, and thus P + ˚ V j · E dV ≡ P + Ploss = 0 =⇒ Ploss = −P = −U I. Note that Ohmic losses amount to Ploss = −U I, which is the familiar expression from e.g. high school physics. The energy balance reads P + ˚ j · E dV = P + Ploss = U I − U I = 0, and energy is conserved, at it must be. 10.4 Cylindrical Conductor with a Slit Consider a long cylindrical conductor of radius a and cross-sectional area S carrying a current I. We cut a narrow slit of width d ≪ a through the conductor in a plane parallel to the circular cross section. De- termine the magnitude and direction of the electric and magnetic fields in the slit, then calculate the en- ergy flow through the slit’s lateral surface and confirm the validity of Poynting’s theorem for conservation of electromagnetic energy. Because of the current I, positive charge accumulates on one surface of the slit and negative charge on the other. Because d ≪ a, we can thus treat the two surfaces of the slit as parallel-plate capacitor. 51 10.4. Cylindrical Conductor with a Slit The charge accumulating on the slit is q(t) = It, and, using the model of a parallel- plate capacitor, the corresponding electric field is E(t) = σ(t) ϵ0 = 1 ϵ0 q(t) S = I ϵ0S t. Next, we find the magnetic field in the slit. The time-varying changing electric field E(t) creates displacement current, and the Maxwell equation for ∇ × B reads ∇ × B = µ0j + ϵ0µ0 ∂E ∂t = ϵ0µ0 ∂E ∂t . Note that µ0j = 0 inside the slit, since there’s no free current. We integrate the equation over the conductor’s cross-sectional surface S to get ¨ S ∇ × B · dS = ˛ B · dl = ϵ0µ0 ∂ ∂t ¨ S E · dS = ϵ0µ0 ∂E ∂t · (πr2). We evaluate the line integral over the surface’s boundary and substitute in electric field to get ˛ B · dl = B · (2πr) = ϵ0µ0 ∂E(t) ∂t =⇒ B(r) = µ0I 2S r = µ0I 2πr , where S = πr2 is the cross-sectional surface area. The magnetic field points tangent to the cylindrical lateral, just like the magnetic field of a conductor, except that free current is replaced by displacement current. Since E points along the conductor’s longitudinal axis and B is tangent to the lateral surface, S = E × B points along the radial direction. Because B ⊥ S, the power through the lateral surface is simply P = ¨ Slat S dS = 1 µ0 ¨ Slat EB dS = 1 µ0 ¨ Slat ( I ϵ0S t ) ( µ0I 2S r) dS. We set r = a at the lateral surface to get P = I 2a 2ϵ0S2 t(2πad) = I 2d ϵ0S t, where S = πa2 is cross sectional area at r = a. Finally we consider the conductor’s energy balance. If we neglect Ohmic losses, the energy balance reads ∂ ∂t ˚ V w dV + ‹ ∂V S · dS = ∂WEM ∂t + P = 0, where WEM = WE + WB is the sum of magnetic and electric field energy. Note that B = B(r) and thus magnetic energy WB is independent of time. It follows that ∂WEM ∂t = ∂WE ∂t + 0. 52 10.4. Cylindrical Conductor with a Slit Using WE = wEV , the electric field energy in the slit is WE = wEV = ( 1 2 ϵ0E2) · (Sd) = ϵ0 2 I 2 ϵ2 0S2 Sdt 2 = I 2d 2ϵ0S t 2. In terms of WE, the time derivative of total magnetic field energy is thus ∂WEM ∂t = ∂WE ∂t = ∂ ∂t I 2d 2ϵ0S t 2 = I 2d ϵ0S t = P. Up to a negative sign (depending on the direction of current), ∂WEM ∂t and P are equal, indicating that energy is conserved, as it must be. 53 11.1. A Radially Polarized Sphere 11 Eleventh Exercise Set 11.1 A Radially Polarized Sphere Consider a radially polarized sphere of radius a in which electric polarization points in the radial direction and grows with increasing radius as P(r) = kr where k is a constant. Find the volume density of bound charges, the surface density of bound charges, and the total bound charge. Finally, find the electric field due to the polarized sphere. Polarization and bound charge density ρb are related by ρb = −∇ · P, while electric field and total charge density ρ are related by Gauss’s law ρ = ϵ0∇ · E. We find volume charge density with ρb = −∇ · P and the known expression for P: ρb = −∇ · P = −∇ · (kr) = −k∇ · r = −3k, where we’ve used ∇ · r = 3. Note the bound volume charge density is negative, since the electric dipoles in the sphere have their positive poles radially outward and negative pole radially inward, so negative charge is concentrated toward the sphere’s center. To relate surface and volume charge density, we integrate ρb = −∇ · P over the sphere’s volume and apply the divergence theorem ˚ V ρb dV = qb = − ˚ V ∇ · P dV = − ¨ S P · dS = −P · S∣ ∣out in , where the last step writes S = ˆnS and notes that polarization is zero outside the sphere. The bound surface charge density is then qb = P · ˆnS =⇒ σB = qb S = P · ˆn. At the surface r = a, charge density σb evaluates to σb = P · ˆn = (kr) · ˆn = kr∣ ∣r=a = ka. Note that surface charge density is positive, since the electric dipoles have their positive pole oriented radially outward. We find total bound charge from ρb and σb by integrating both volume and surface charge densities: qb = ˚ V ρb dV + ¨ S σb dS = −3k 4 3 πa 3 + ka4πa 2 = 0. We should expect total charge to be zero, since all dipoles within the sphere should cancel out. 54 11.2. A Halved Polarized Sphere Finding the Electric Field By Gauss’s law, the electric field outside the sphere is zero, since the sphere’s total charge is zero. Inside the sphere, using the problem’s spherical symmetry, we use Gauss’s law with a spherical surface to get ϵ0E4πr2 = ρbV = ρb 4 3 πr3 =⇒ E(r) = ρb 3ϵ0 r. The electric field points radially outwards: E(r) = ρb 3ϵ0 r. We then substitute in the charge density ρb = −3k to get E = −k ϵ0 r =⇒ E = − P ϵ0 . Note the linear relationship between electric field and polarization. The linear relationship arises because the sphere contains only bound charge, meaning total charge and bound charge are equal, i.e. ρ = ρb. We could then combine ρb = ρ = −∇ · P and Gauss’s law ρ = ∇ · (ϵ0E) to get E = − P ϵ0 . 11.2 A Halved Polarized Sphere Consider a sphere of radius a with homogeneous (uniform) polarization P pointing in the z direction. Find the electric field inside and outside the sphere. We then cut the sphere in half in a plane perpendicular to the direction of polarization and slightly separate the halves to form a capacitor. Find the electric field in the slit between the halves. First, we find volume density of bound charges, which is ρb = −∇ · P = 0, since the divergence of P, which is homogeneous, is zero by definition. In other words, there are no bound charges in the sphere’s volume. Next, we find bound surface charge density σb = P · ˆn where ˆn is the normal to the surface. In terms of an θ between the normal ˆn and polarization P, surface charge density is σb = P · ˆn = P cos θ. We proceed with the Poisson equation, which simplifies to the Laplace equation within the sphere were ρb = 0. ∇2U (r) = − ρb ϵ0 = 0. We account for the non-zero surface charge density with boundary conditions. 55 11.2. A Halved Polarized Sphere The general solution for U (r) is U (r) = U (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 (Alrl + Blr−(l+1))Pl(cos θ). Since the surface charge distribution σb depends only on cos θ, our solution can include only cos θ-dependent terms, which occurs for l = 1. The general solution simplifies to U (r) = (A1r + B1r−2) cos θ. To avoid divergence at r → 0 and r → ∞, we separate U (r) according to U (r) ≡ { Uin = A1r cos θ r < a Uout = B1r−2 cos θ r > a. We find A1 and B1 with boundary conditions. First boundary condition: the electric potential must be continuous at the boundary (a discontinuous potential would imply infinite charge, which is nonphysical). The continuity condition at r = a requires A1a = B1 a2 =⇒ B1 = A1a 3. For the second boundary condition we require electric field is perpendicular to the surface. We then apply Gauss’s law near the sphere’s surface to get qb = ϵ0S(E⊥ out − E⊥ in) =⇒ σb = ϵ0(E⊥ out − E⊥ in). We know σb = P cos θ and use E⊥ in/out = − ∂Uin/out ∂r ∣ ∣ r=a to get σb = P cos θ = ϵ0(E⊥ out − E⊥ in) = ϵ0 [ 2B1 a3 + A1 ] cos θ. We substitute the first boundary condition B1 = A1a3 into the second to get P cos θ = ϵ0 (2A1 + A1) cos θ =⇒ P = 3ϵ0A1 and thus A1 = P 3ϵ0 and B1 = P a3 3ϵ0 . The electric potential is then U (r) ≡    Uin = P 3ϵ0 r cos θ r < a Uout = P a3 3ϵ0 1 r2 cos θ r > a. We now discuss the solution. The 3 in the denominators is called the depolarization factor. Next, we note that r cos θ = z—since Uin depends only on z, the field inside the sphere is homogeneous: Ez = − ∂Uin ∂z = − P 3ϵ0 =⇒ E = − P 3ϵ0 , 56 11.3. Theory: Dielectric and Displacement Field where we note that P points in the z direction. The field is negative because with our choice of polarization, positive charges are in the positive z direction and negative charges in the negative z direction. The field outside the sphere is field of an electric dipole; the cosine term is analogous to the dipole dot product term pe · r. A dipole field is expected, since the sphere is polarized like an electric dipole. Halved Sphere; Electric Field in the Slit We now consider the electric field in the slit when the sphere is cut in half in a plane perpendicular to the polarization. Because of the slit through the middle, bound charges accumulates on the cut surfaces as well as the outer surface. Since polarization points “upwards” in the positive z direction, the bound charges on cut surface of the upper hemisphere are negative, while the bound charges on the cut surface of the lower sphere are positive. The relationship σb = P · ˆn is preserved. To find electric field because of the slit, we model the slit as a parallel-plate capacitor, for which the electric field reads ˜E = ˜σb ϵ0 ˆn = (P · ˆn) ϵ0 ˆn = P ϵ0 , where tilde corresponds to the flat surface and ˆn is the normal to the flat surface. We must also consider the electric field contribution from the bound charge on the hemispherical surfaces. Reusing the already derived electric field from the bound charges on the spherical surfaces, which read Esphere = − P 3ϵ0 , the total field in the slit is E = ˜E + Esphere = P ϵ0 − P 3ϵ0 = 2P 3ϵ0 . 11.3 Theory: Dielectric and Displacement Field The previous two problems involved ferro-electric materials in which the polarization was built in to the material, even in the absence of an external electric field. We now consider dielectric materials, in which polarization occurs only in the presence of an external field. Recall the equations ρb = −∇ · P and Gauss’s law ρ = ϵ0∇ · E. We subtract the equations to get ρf = ρ − ρb = ∇ · (ϵ0E + P) ≡ ∇ · D, where the free charge density ρf = ρ − ρb is difference between the total and bound charge densities. The electric displacement field is defined as D = ϵ0E + P. 57 11.4. Parallel-Plate Capacitor with an Anisotropic Dielectric The D field arises from free charge and is useful when analyzing dielectrics. For small fields, we make the approximation D ∝ E where D and E are linearly dependent, which results in the approximate linear relationship D = ϵ0χE, where χ is the permittivity tensor. 11.4 Parallel-Plate Capacitor with an Anisotropic Dielectric Consider a parallel-plate capacitor with plate separation d, plate surface area S, and the intra-plate space filled with a dielectric insulator whose dielectric tensor has components ϵ1, ϵ2 and ϵ2. The principle axes corresponding to ϵ1 and ϵ3 are parallel to the capacitor plates, but the principle axis corresponding to ϵ2 makes an angle ϕ with the normal to the plates. Find the capacitor’s capacitance C. First, recall that capacitance is in general defined as C = q U , where q is the charge on the capacitor plates and U is the potential difference between the plates. Because χ is angled (equivalently, because χ’s second principle axis does not align with the normal to the capacitor plates), E and D are not parallel. From the boundary conditions for Maxwell’s equations, we know E must be perpen- dicular to the capacitor plates. To show this, for review, we consider the Maxwell equation ∇ × E = − ∂B ∂t . In our static case we have ∂B ∂t = 0. We integrate the equation over a surface hugging the boundary and apply Stokes’ theorem to get ¨ S ∇ × E · ∇ · S = ˛ E · dl = 0, where the line integral runs over a rectangular path thinly hugging a capacitor plate. Because the path thinly hugs the plate, the integral registers only the component of E parallel to the plates: E(∥) out · l − E(∥) in · l = 0 =⇒ E(∥) out = E(∥) in . Because the electric field outside the capacitor is zero, we have E(∥) out = 0 =⇒ E(∥) in = 0. The result E(∥) in = 0 implies the electric field has only a component perpendicular to the capacitor plates. 58 11.4. Parallel-Plate Capacitor with an Anisotropic Dielectric Working in the two-dimensional x, y plane (since the problem is invariant to translation in the z direction along the plates) the dielectric tensor in the principle axis system, which we denote ˜χ, reads ˜χ = ( ϵ1 0 0 ϵ2 ) . The capacitor’s coordinate system is rotated by ϕ relative to the principle axis system. To transform from ˜χ to χ, we rotate the principle axes tensor by rotation matrices: χ = R ˜χR = ( cos ϕ sin ϕ − sin ϕ cos ϕ ) ( ϵ1 0 0 ϵ2 ) ( cos ϕ − sin ϕ sin ϕ cos ϕ ) = [ϵ1 cos2 ϕ + ϵ2 sin 2 ϕ (ϵ2 − ϵ1) sin ϕ cos ϕ (ϵ2 − ϵ1) sin ϕ cos ϕ ϵ1 sin 2 ϕ + ϵ2 cos2 ϕ ] . Note that χ is symmetric, as is expected for the dielectric tensor. Because of the boundary condition, E∥ = 0, if follows that E has only a y component (where the y axis is normal to the plates). The electric field then reads E = (Ex, Ey) ≡ (0, E), which we combine with D = ϵ0χE to get ( Dx Dy ) = ϵ0 [ϵ1 cos2 ϕ + ϵ2 sin 2 ϕ (ϵ2 − ϵ1) sin ϕ cos ϕ (ϵ2 − ϵ1) sin ϕ cos ϕ ϵ1 sin 2 ϕ + ϵ2 cos2 ϕ ] ( 0 E ) . In terms of E, the electric field between the capacitor plates is simply U = Ed, where d is the distance between the plates. Next, we use the boundary condition on the D field to find the charge q on the plates. We derive the relevant boundary condition, we apply Gauss’s law to a thin region tightly enclosing a capacitor plate. For the D field, which obeys ∇ · D = ρf, Gauss’s law reads ˚ V ρf dV = ¨ S D · dS =⇒ qf = [D(⊥) out − D(⊥) in ] S. In our case, where D(⊥) out = 0 and D(⊥) out = Dy the charge on the capacitor plates (up to a minus sign depending on the definition of the surface normal) is qf = DyS. We find Dy from the earlier matrix equation: Dy = ϵ0 (ϵ1 sin 2 ϕ + ϵ2 cos2 ϕ) E = ϵ0 (ϵ1 sin 2 ϕ + ϵ2 cos2 ϕ) U d . The charge on the capacitor plates is then qf = DyS = ϵ0SU d (ϵ1 sin 2 ϕ + ϵ2 cos2 ϕ) . In terms of qf, the capacitor’s capacitance C is C = qf U = ϵ0S d (ϵ1 sin 2 ϕ + ϵ2 cos2 ϕ) = C0 (ϵ1 sin 2 ϕ + ϵ2 cos2 ϕ) , 59 11.4. Parallel-Plate Capacitor with an Anisotropic Dielectric where C0 = ϵ0S d is the capacitance of an empty capacitor. Note that for ϕ = 0, corresponding to an isotropic dielectric in which the dielectric tensor’s second principle axes does align with normal to the capacitor plates, the capacitor’s capacitance reduces to C = C0ϵ2. 60 12.1. Point Dipole in a Spherical Dielectric Cavity 12 Twelfth Exercise Set 12.1 Point Dipole in a Spherical Dielectric Cavity Consider an empty spherical cavity of radius a within a vast dielectric material with permittivity ϵ. We place an electric dipole with dipole momentum pe in the cavity. What is the resulting electric potential inside and outside the cavity? Find the resulting effective dipole moment p′ e in the dielectric. We choose our coordinate system so that the dipole pe within the cavity points in the z direction. We find the electric potential due to the dipole by solving the Laplace equation ∇2U (r) = 0. In spherical coordinates, which are best suited to the problem’s spherical geometry, the general solution is U (r, θ) = ∞∑ l=0 (Alrl + Blr−(l+1))Pl(cos θ), where Pl are the Legendre polynomials. We then consider boundary conditions along the spherical cavity’s surface and at the center of the cavity, where the dipole pe is placed. The potential at the sphere’s center should approach the potential of an electric dipole: U (r → 0, θ) = Udipole = pe cos θ 4πϵ0r2 . Because this solution contains only cos θ to the first power, only the l = 1 term containing cos θ can occur in the general solution for U , simplifying the solution to U (r, θ) = (A1r + B1r−2) cos θ. For the potential to converge at r → ∞, the A1r term must vanish at large r (outside the cavity). The general solution further simplifies to U (r) = { Udipole + A1r cos θ r < a B1r−2 cos θ r > a =    pe cos θ 4πϵ0r2 + A1r cos θ r < a B1 r2 cos θ r > a. Next, we require U is continuous at the cavity’s boundary r = a, which produces U (r → a+) = U (r → a −) =⇒ pe 4πϵ0a2 + A1a = B1 a2 . Note: We could derive the same result using the boundary conditions for Maxwell’s equations in materials, among which is required that the component of electric field 61 12.1. Point Dipole in a Spherical Dielectric Cavity E∥ tangent to the boundary surface must be equal on both sides of the boundary. The tangential component of electric field is found with E∥ = − 1 r ∂U ∂θ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r=a, and the boundary condition E∥ in = E∥ out then implies − pe 4πϵ0a2 sin θ − A1a sin θ = B1 a2 sin θ, which is the same result we arrived at from requiring continuity of electric potential U at the boundary. Finally, we apply the boundary condition on the D field, which applies to the components D⊥ perpendicular to the boundary surface and reads D⊥ in − D⊥ out = σf, where σf is the surface density of free charges along the boundary. We find D⊥ with D⊥ = −ϵϵ0 ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣r=a, . In our case, which involves a dielectric with only bound charges, we have σf, and the boundary condition on D reduces to D⊥ in = D⊥ out ⇐⇒ ϵ0ϵin ∂Uin ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r=a = ϵ0ϵout ∂Uout ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣r=a. The dielectric constant inside the empty cavity is ϵin = 1, and we denote ϵout ≡ ϵ in the dielectric. We then substitute Uin and Uout into the boundary condition and simplify to get 2 pe 4πϵ0a3 − A1 = 2ϵ B1 a3 . We then add the earlier boundary condition requiring continuity of U , which read pe 4πϵ0a3 + A1 = B1 a3 , to the just-derived boundary condition on D⊥ to get 3 pe 4πϵ0a3 = B1 a3 (1 + 2ϵ) =⇒ B1 = 3 1 + 2ϵ pe 4πϵ0 . With B1 known, we can find A1 according to A1 = B1 a3 − pe 4πϵ0a3 = pe 4πϵ0a3 ( 3 1 + 2ϵ − 1) = 2(1 − ϵ) 1 + 2ϵ pe 4πϵ0a3 . With the coefficients A1 and B1 known, the solution for U (r, θ) is then U (r, θ) = pe 4πϵ0 cos θ    1 r2 − 2(ϵ − 1) 1 + 2ϵ r a3 r < a 3 1 + 2ϵ 1 r2 r > a. 62 12.2. Dielectric Constant of Cold Plasma Inside the cavity where r < a, the first 1/r2 term is the potential of the electric dipole pe, while the term containing r cos θ ≡ z corresponds to a homogeneous field inside the cavity. Outside the cavity where r > a, we have another 1/r2 term—again like a dipole, but with an additional factor 3 1+2ϵ , which would reduce to the usual 1 for a dielectric constant ϵ = 1. This is the so-called effective dipole term in the problem instructions. Outside the cavity we thus have the effective dipole moment p′ e = 3 1 + 2ϵ pe. To find the surface density of bound charges, we have two options. We could could use Gauss’s law in the form σb = ϵ0 (E⊥ out − E⊥ in) , E⊥ = − ∂U ∂r ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ r=a. Alternatively, we could use the relationship between surface charge density and polarization, which reads σb = P · ˆn. Note that the surface’s normal vector ˆn points from the dielectric material’s surface into the cavity, while the polarization P points out of the cavity. The product P · ˆn thus evaluates to P · ˆn ≡ −P⊥, where P⊥ is the component of polarization normal to the cavity’s surface. Assuming a linear relationship between D and E, we then find polarization with ϵ0ϵE ≈ D = ϵ0E + P =⇒ P = ϵ0(ϵ − 1)E. We then use P = ϵ0(ϵ − 1)E to find surface charge density via σb = P · ˆn = −P⊥ = −ϵ0(ϵ − 1)E⊥∣ ∣ r=a. 12.2 Dielectric Constant of Cold Plasma Find the relative permittivity ϵ of a cold plasma, then find the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves in the plasma. Plasma is a gas of ions, i.e. a gas of free electrons that have been ionized from their positive nuclear cores. We assume the plasma is cold to neglect thermal motion. Since the nuclei are much more massive than electrons, we assume the atoms are at rest as a first approximation. We then ask how electromagnetic waves propagates through the plasma. We write the electromagnetic waves in terms of the electric field, which we model with the oscillatory ansatz E(r, t) = E0ei(kz−ωt). 63 12.2. Dielectric Constant of Cold Plasma Assuming the positive ion cores have charge q and electrons have charge −q, the force on a representative free electron of mass m is F = m¨r = −qE = −qE0e i(kz−ωt), where we have introduced the coordinate r to measure the electron’s displacement. Since force is oscillatory, the resulting motion is modeled by r = r0e i(kz−ωt). Substituting the expressions for r and E into Newton’s law m¨r = −qE gives −mω2r0ei(kz−ωt) = −qE0ei(kz−ωt), from which we can find the position’s oscillation amplitude r0 via mω2r0 = qE0 =⇒ r0 = q mω2 E0. The displacement r0 of the negative electron from the positive ion core creates a dipole moment with amplitude pe0 = −qr0 = − q2 mω2 E0. In terms of pe0, the polarization of the plasma is then P0 = npe0 = − nq2 mω2 E0, where n is the number density of electric dipoles in the material. We then use the relationship P, E and permittivity, which reads P0 = ϵ0(ϵ − 1)E0, to find the plasma’s dielectric constant (relative permittivity) ϵ = 1 + P0 ϵ0E0 = 1 − nq2 mϵ0ω2 . Next, we note that nq2 mϵ0 has units of frequency, and define the plasma frequency ω2 p = nq2 mϵ0 , which describes the frequency at which displaced electrons oscillated about the positive ion cores. In terms of plasma frequency, the plasma’s dielectric constant is ϵ = 1 − ω2 p ω2 . Note that for electromagnetic wave frequencies ω > ωp we have ϵ > 0 and for ω < ωp we have ϵ < 0. However, electromagnetic waves cannot propagate through a material 64 12.2. Dielectric Constant of Cold Plasma with dielectric constant ϵ < 0, which we will discuss more shortly. Dispersion Relation for EM Waves in Plasma Next, we will find the dispersion relation for the electromagnetic waves in the plasma. In material with zero electric current density (i.e. j = 0) the Maxwell equations read ∇ · E = 0 ∇ × E = −µ0 ∂H ∂t ∇ · H = 0 ∇ × H = ϵ0ϵ ∂E ∂t . We take the curl of the equations for ∇ · E and ∇ × E to get ∇ × (∇ × E) = −µ0 ∂ ∂t (ϵ0ϵ ∂E ∂t ) ∇(∇ · E) − ∇2E = −µ0ϵϵ0 ∂2E ∂t2 . The relationship ∇ · E = 0 simplifies the second equation to the wave equation ∇ 2E − µ0ϵ0ϵ ∂2E ∂t2 = 0. We then substitute in the oscillatory electric field ansatz E = E0ei(kz−ωt) to get −k2E − µ0ϵ0ϵ(−ω2)E = 0 =⇒ E(µ0ϵ0ϵω2 − k2) = 0. The equality E(µ0ϵ0ϵω2 − k2) = 0 holds for all E only if µ0ϵ0ϵω2 − k2 = 0 =⇒ ω2 k2 = 1 ϵ0µ0 1 ϵ = c2 0 ϵ . Next, we substitute in the plasma’s dielectric constant ϵ = 1 − ω2 p ω2 to get c 2 0 = ϵ ω2 k2 = ω2 k2 ( 1 − ω2 p ω2 ) = ω2 k2 − ω2 p k2 . Finally, we rearrange the relationship between c0, k and ω to get the dispersion relation k2c 2 0 = ω2 − ω2 p =⇒ ω = √ ω2 p + c2 0k2. This is a dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves in the plasma—it relates the waves’ frequency ω and wave vector k. Note that the dispersion relation prohibits ω < ωp since at the minimum possible k, i.e. k = 0, frequency is ω = ωp. The prohibited region of ω < ωp corresponds to ϵ < 0—this relationship quantifies the previous claim that EM waves cannot propagate through materials with ϵ < 0. Note that in a vacuum, with ϵ = 1, EM waves obey the linear dispersion relation ω2 k2 = c2 0 ϵ = c 2 0 =⇒ ω = c0k. We now consider the limiting cases for the dispersion relation in plasma, i.e. ω = √ ω2 p + c2 0k2. 65 12.2. Dielectric Constant of Cold Plasma For large k, such that c0k ≫ ωp, we approach the linear relation ω = c0k. Meanwhile, very small k, such that c0k ≪ ωp, result in the constant dispersion relation ω → ωp. We get a more accurate approximation for small k with the first-order Taylor approximation ω = ωp ( 1 + c2 0 ω2 p k2)1/2 ≈ ωp [ 1 + c2 0 2ω2 p k2] , ( k ≪ wp c0 ) . As a side note, we remark that in this limit of small k, where the dispersion relation obeys ω ∼ k2. A quadratic dispersion relation means the photons making up the electric field behave like particles with mass, which leads to the concept of effective mass, like in solid state physics. Further Discussion Next, we more thoroughly consider the regime of ϵ < 0. Assuming ϵ < 0, we rearranging the equation ω2 k2 = c2 0 ϵ to get k = ω c0 √ϵ = ω c0 i √ϵR, where k is imaginary because ϵ < 0. Substituting this expression for k into the oscillator ansatz for the electric field E gives E = E0e i(kz−ωt) = E0e− ω c0 √ϵRze−iωt. The position-dependent term is proportional to e−z, which means that an electro- magnetic wave will exponentially decay with position in a material with ϵ < 0. Next, we use the dispersion relation to find the group and phase velocity of the electromagnetic waves in the plasma. The phase velocity is vphase = ωp k = √ ω2 p + c2 0k2 k = √ c2 0 + ω2 p k2 . Note that vphase > c0—the phase velocity is greater than the speed of light in vacuum. The group velocity—the quantity relevant to the universal speed limit of c0—is vgroup = ∂ω ∂k = 2c2 0k 2√ ω2 p + c2 0k2 = c0√ 1 + ω2 p c2 0k2 . As expected, vgroup < c0, in agreement with special relativity. As a final comment, note that vphasevgroup = c2 0. 66 13.1. Theory: Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Waveguides 13 Thirteenth Exercise Set 13.1 Theory: Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Waveguides Consider an empty waveguide (i.e. with relative permittivity ϵ = 1). The wave equation for EM waves reads ∇2E − 1 c2 0 ∂2E ∂t2 = 0, where c0 is the speed of light in a vacuum. As a simplification, we assume the waveguide has a bounded, pipe-like waveguide, with the longitudinal axis coinciding with the ˆz axis, so that EM waves are restricted to propagation in the ˆz direction. In this case, the electric field takes the form E(r, t) = E(ρ)e i(kz−ωt), where ρ is the radial position within the waveguide’s planar cross section, i.e. the (x, y) plane perpendicular to the direction of EM propagation along ˆz, k is the wave vector corresponding to wave propagation in the ˆz direction, and ω is the wave’s frequency. With respect to this ansatz, the z and t derivatives produce ∂ ∂z = ik =⇒ ∂2 ∂z2 = −k2 and ∂ ∂t = −iω =⇒ ∂2 ∂t2 = −ω2. Using the expression for ∂ ∂z , we then write the Laplacian in the separated form ∇2 = ∂2 ∂z2 + ∇2 ⊥ = −k2 + ∇2 ⊥, where ∇2 ⊥ = ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 corresponds to differentiation in the (x, y) plane, i.e. the waveguide’s cross section. The wave equation in a waveguide then simplifies to [ ∇2 ⊥ + ( ω2 c2 0 − k2)] E(ρ, t) = 0. Although the electric field above is E = E(ρ), we can generalize this to [ ∇2 ⊥ + ( ω2 c2 0 − k2)] E(r, t) = 0. We can include the ei(kz−ωt), whose only variables are z and t, because the above wave equation doesn’t contain ∂ ∂z or ∂ ∂t derivatives (but only ∂ ∂x and ∂ ∂y derivatives because of ∇2 ⊥). Since E ∈ R3 has three components, the above wave equation in vector form really has 3 equations for each of E’s three components. Similarly, we could derive an analogous vector wave equation for magnetic field H: [ ∇2 ⊥ + ( ω2 c2 0 − k2)] H(r, t) = 0. 67 13.1. Theory: Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Waveguides This vector equation also contain three equations for each of H’s three components. As a result, the electromagnetic waves’ propagation in the vacuum is nominally described by 3 + 3 = 6 equations. However, it turns out that we can express multiple H in terms of E, which simplifies the equations involved. Our goal in the coming page will be to express Ex, Ey, Hx and Hy in terms of only Ez and Hz. Relationship Between E and H We begin with the Maxwell equations ∇ × E = −µ0 ∂H ∂t and ∇ × H = ϵ0 ∂E ∂t . In component form, the equation for ∇ × E reads    ∂ ∂x ∂ ∂y ∂ ∂z    ×    Ex Ey Ez    =    ∂Ez ∂y − ikEy ikEx − ∂Ez ∂x ∂Ey ∂x − ∂Ex ∂y    = iµ0ω    Hx Hy Hz    , where we have used ∂ ∂z = ik and ∂ ∂t = −iω. The second equation for ∇ × H reads    ∂ ∂x ∂ ∂y ∂ ∂z    ×    Hx Hy Hz    =    ∂Hz ∂y − ikHy ikHx − ∂Hz ∂x ∂Hy ∂x − ∂Hx ∂y    = −iϵ0ω    Ex Ey Ez    . The first and fifth equations both contain Hx and Ey. They read ∂Ez ∂y − ikEy = iµ0ωHx and ikHx − ∂Hz ∂x = −iϵ0ωEy. Our next step is to eliminate Hx: we multiply the first equation by k, the second by µ0ω, and subtract the two equations to get k ∂Ez ∂y − ik2Ey = µ0ω ( ∂Hz ∂x − iϵ0ωEy ) . We then rearrange to get k ∂Ez ∂y − µ0ω ∂Hz ∂x = iEy (k2 − ω2µ0ϵ0) = iEy (k2 − ω2 c2 ) , and finally solve for Ey in terms of the z componentsEz and Hz: Ey = i k ∂Ez ∂y − µ0ω ∂Hz ∂x ω2 c2 − k2 . We could perform an analogous procedure the remaining equations to solve for the remaining components Ex, Hx and Hy in terms of Ez and Hz. Without derivation, 68 13.2. A Parallel-Plate Waveguide the results are Hx = i k ∂Hz ∂x − ωϵ0 ∂Ez ∂y ω2 c2 − k2 Ex = i k ∂Ez ∂x + ωµ0 ∂Hz ∂y ω2 c2 − k2 Hy = i k ∂Hz ∂y + ωϵ0 ∂Ez ∂x ω2 c2 − k2 . Note that these equations apply only in Cartesian coordinates for a pipe-like waveguide where waves propagate along the ˆz direction. Next, we consider boundary conditions at the waveguide’s walls. We begin with the Maxwell equations ∇ × E = −µ0 ∂H ∂t and ∇ · H = 0, and encircle a small portion of the waveguide boundary wall with a hypothetical closed loop. We then send to loop to zero thickness while applying Stokes’ law, which results in ∇ × E → 0 =⇒ E∥ = 0 and H⊥ → 0. In other words, the component of electric field parallel to the waveguide boundary and the component of magnetic field normal to the waveguide boundary are zero. Finally, we find Ez and Hz from the waveguide wave equations [ ∇2 ⊥ + ( w2 c2 − k2)] {Ez Hz } = 0. By convention, since the wave equation is a second-order order equation, we consider two linear independent solutions with orthogonal components. These are: • Transverse electric (TE) wave propagation with Ez = 0 and Hz ̸= 0. This is propogation mode is called transverse electric because, from Ez = 0, the electric field is perpendicular (transverse) to the direction of EM wave propagation along the ˆz axis. • Transverse magnetic (TM) wave propagation with Hz = 0 and Ez ̸= 0. The first propogation mode is called transverse magnetic (TM) because the magnetic field is perpendicular (transverse) to the direction of EM wave propagation (since Hz = 0). The general solution for EM waves in the waveguide is then a linear combination of the two solutions. 13.2 A Parallel-Plate Waveguide Consider a waveguide consisting to two large parallel conducting plates separated by the distance a, in which waves propagate along the z axis. For both transverse magnetic and transverse electric wave propagation, find: 69 13.2. A Parallel-Plate Waveguide 1. The solution for the electric field in the waveguide 2. The dispersion relation relating wave vector and wave frequency 3. The wave impedance Z 4. The ratio of electric field amplitudes Ex to Ez Transverse Magnetic Solution First, we define our coordinate system, which is easiest to visualize in terms of two horizontal, parallel plates drawn on a piece of paper. We choose the direction of wave propagation z to run from left to right along the paper; the x axis, which runs from bottom to top in the paper, separates the two plates, and the y axis points out of the page. Because of translational symmetry along the y axis (i.e. because the plates are “large”), their is no change in physical quantities with respect to y, so ∂ ∂y = 0. In transverse magnetic (TM) wave propagation, we have Hz = 0 and Ez ̸= 0. From the introductory theory section, recall the equations Ex = i k ∂Ez ∂x + ωµ0 ∂Hz ∂y ω2 c2 − k2 Ey = i k ∂Ez ∂y − µ0ω ∂Hz ∂x ω2 c2 − k2 Hx = i k ∂Hz ∂x − ωϵ0 ∂Ez ∂y ω2 c2 − k2 Hy = i k ∂Hz ∂y + ωϵ0 ∂Ez ∂x ω2 c2 − k2 , which express Ex, Ey, Hx and Hy in terms of Ez and Hz. Using Hz = 0, which holds in general for TM waves, and ∂ ∂y = 0, which holds for our translationally-invariant waveguide geometry, the field components simplify to Ey = Hx = 0 and Ex = ik κ2 ∂Ez ∂x and Hy = iωϵ0 κ2 ∂Ez ∂x , κ2 = w2 c2 + k2. Note that H = (0, Hy, 0) has only an y component, while E = (Ex, 0, Ez) has both x and z components. Next, we find Ez using the wave equation [ ∇2 ⊥ + κ 2] Ez = ( ∂2 ∂x2 + κ 2) Ez = 0 =⇒ ∂2Ez ∂x2 = −κ 2Ez, where we have again used κ2 = w2 c2 + k2 for conciseness. The last equality holds because ∂ ∂y = 0. The equation is solved with the oscillatory ansatz Ez(x) = A sin κx + B cos κx. Next, we consider boundary conditions along the waveguide plates. The general condition E∥ = 0 applies to the parallel components to waveguide surface, which in our geometry are Ez and Ey. The result is Ez = Ey = 0—note that we knew the result Ey from earlier. Evaluated at the boundaries surfaces x = 0 and x = a, the condition reads E∥ = Ez(0) = Ez(a) = 0. 70 13.2. A Parallel-Plate Waveguide We substitute the boundary condition Ez(0) = 0 into the solution ansatz to get Ez(0) ≡ 0 = A sin κ · 0 + B cos κ · 0 =⇒ B = 0. The solution then simplifies to Ez(x) = A sin κx. Next, we apply the condition Ez(a) = 0, which gives Ez(a) ≡ 0 = A sin κa =⇒ κ = nπ a , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Note that n = 0 gives a trivial solution. The solution for Ez in TM mode is then Ez(x) = A sin κx = A sin nπx a . Dispersion Relation Next, we aim to find the dispersion relation between frequency ω and wave vector k. Combining the definition κ2 = w2 c2 + k2 with the just-derived result κ = nπ a shows the dispersion relation is κ 2 ≡ ω2 c2 − k2 = ( nπ a )2 =⇒ ω = c0 √ k2 + ( nπ a )2. At large k, this approaches the free space relation ω = c0k Note that frequencies below c0 nπ a are unattainable, since k2 cannot decrease below zero. In other words, there is a minimum possible frequency at which EM waves can propagate through the waveguide. When k = 0, the frequencies are quantized according to ωn = c0 nπ a . We call the frequency band ∆ω ≡ ω2 − ω1 the waveguide bandwidth. In our case, the bandwidth is ∆ω = c0π a . Wave Impedance Wave impedance (not to be confused with electrical impedance), is the ratio of the transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields with respect to the direction of wave propagation. For TM waves, wave impedance is defined in terms of the E and H fields as Z ≡ E⊥ H∥ . For our parallel-plate waveguide with E⊥ = Ex and Hx = 0 =⇒ H∥ = Hy, the waveguide impedance is Z = Ex Hy . 71 13.2. A Parallel-Plate Waveguide Using the earlier equations for the components Ex and Hy, we have Z = Ex Hy = ik ∂Ez ∂x iωϵ0 ∂Ez ∂x = k ωϵ0 . We then use the dispersion relation between ω and k to get Z = √ ω2 c2 0 − ( nπ a )2 ωϵ0 = 1 c0ϵ0 √ 1 − 1 ω2 ( nπc0 a )2. The coefficient 1 c0ϵ0 has a special meaning—it is the impedance of free space Z0, which is more visible in the form 1 c0ϵ0 = √ϵ0µ0 ϵ0 = √ µ0 ϵ0 ≡ Z0. In terms of Z0 and the frequency ωn = nπc0 a , the dispersion relation is written concisely as Z(ω) = Z0 √ 1 − ( ωn ω )2. For large ω, the impedance approaches Z0. Ratio of Electric Field Amplitudes Next, we find the ratio of electric field amplitudes Ez Ex . Substituting in the equation for Ex gives Ez Ex = Ez ik ∂Ez ∂x κ 2. Next, we substitute in the earlier result Ez = A sin κx to get Ez Ex = Ez ik ∂Ez ∂x κ2 = A sin κx ikκA sin κx κ 2 = κ k . We can interpret κ as a wave vector in the x direction, while k is the wave vector along the direction of propagation z. TE Propagation Mode In TE mode, we have Ez = 0 and we find Hz ̸= 0. Once again, we start with the field component equations Ex = i κ (k ∂Ez ∂x + ωµ0 ∂Hz ∂y ) Ey = i κ (k ∂Ez ∂y − µ0ω ∂Hz ∂x ) Hx = i κ ( k ∂Hz ∂x − ωϵ0 ∂Ez ∂y ) Hy = i κ ( k ∂Hz ∂y + ωϵ0 ∂Ez ∂x ) , which express Ex, Ey, Hx and Hy in terms of Ez and Hz. Using Ez = 0 and ∂ ∂y = 0, the field components simplify to Ex = Hy = 0 and Ey = − iµ0ω κ ∂Hz ∂x and Hx = ik κ ∂Hz ∂x . 72 13.2. A Parallel-Plate Waveguide Note that E = (0, Ey, 0) has only an y component, while H = (Hx, 0, Hz) has both x and z components. Next, as for Ez, we find Hz using the wave equation [ ∇2 ⊥ + κ 2] Hz = ( ∂2 ∂x2 + κ 2) Hz = 0 =⇒ ∂2Hz ∂x2 = −κ 2Hz. The equation is solved with Hz = A sin κx + B cos κx. The boundary conditions in TE mode are different than in TM mode. For TE mode, we use the boundary condition H⊥ = 0. For our coordinate system and parallel-plate waveguide, the component of H perpendicular to the surface is Hx, which is Hx = ik κ ∂Hz ∂x . Using the above expression for Hx in terms of ∂Hz ∂x , the condition H⊥ = Hx = 0 at the boundary surfaces reads Hx(x = 0, a) ∝ ∂Hz ∂x ∣ ∣ ∣x=0,a = 0. Thus, in TE mode, the boundary condition is written in terms of a derivative—note that ∂Hz ∂x is a “normal” derivative; since ∂Hz ∂x points in the direction x, which is normal to the waveguide’s boundary. In general, the boundary condition in TE mode involves the normal derivative of Hz with respect to the waveguide boundary surface, although the relevant coordinate will naturally not always be x for different geometries and coordinate systems. Taking the derivative of Hz and evaluating the boundary condition gives Hz(x) = B cos nπx a , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Note that n = 0 produces the constant solution Hz = B which is not a trivial solution in itself, but the other field components, which involve derivatives of the constant quantity Hz, are zero, so we again reject n = 0. Since the quantity κ is the same in TE mode as in TM mode, the dispersion relation in TE is the same, and reads ω = c0 √ k2 + ( nπ a )2. For TE waves, wave impedance is defined in terms of the E and H fields as Z ≡ E∥ H⊥ . 73 13.2. A Parallel-Plate Waveguide For our parallel-plate waveguide with E∥ = Ey and H⊥ = Hx, the waveguide impedance is Z = Ey Hx . Using the earlier equations for the components Ey and Hx (although I’ve ignored the negative sign in Ey), we have Z = Ey Hx = iµ0ω ∂Hz ∂x ik ∂Hz ∂x = µ0ω k . We then substitute in the dispersion relation between w and k to get Z = µ0ω k = µ0ω √ ω2 c2 0 − ( nπ a )2 = µ0c0√ 1 − ω2 n ω2 , where we’ve used ωn = nπc0 a . Finally, we use the relationship c0 = 1√ϵ0µ0 to get µ0c0 = µ0 √µ0ϵ0 = √ µ0 ϵ0 = Z0 =⇒ Z(ω) = Z0√ 1 − ( ωn ω )2 . Generalization: Waveguide With a Rectangular Cross Section Finally, we consider a waveguide with a rectangular cross section with width and height a and b, corresponding to the x and y directions, respectively. Waves propagate along the z axis. As before, the “cross-sectional” Laplacian reads ∇2 ⊥ = ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 . Note both ∂ ∂x and ∂ ∂y are non-zero, since the waveguide is not finite-dimensional in the y direction. The wave equation reads ( ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 + κ 2) Ez(x, y) = 0. We solve the equation with separation of variables: Ez(x, y) = X(x)Y (y). We then substitute the ansatz for Ez into the wave equation to get X ′′Y + XY ′′ + κ 2XY = 0 =⇒ X ′′ X + Y ′′ Y = −κ 2. Since the X terms depend only on x and the Y terms only on y, but X ′′ X and Y ′′ Y must be constant for the equation to hold. We thus define X ′′ X = −κ 2 x =⇒ X ′′ = −κ 2 xX and Y ′′ Y = −κ2 y =⇒ Y ′′ = −κ2 yY. Both equations are solved with sinusoidal solutions of the form X = A sin κxx + B cos κxx and Y = C sin κyy + D cos κyy. 74 13.2. A Parallel-Plate Waveguide The boundary conditions now involve both a and b; the results are κx = nπ a and κy = mπ b , n, m = 1, 2, 3, . . . , where κ2 = κ2 x + κ2 y. The dispersion relation now reads ω = c0 √ k2 + ( nπ a )2 + ( mπ b )2. In TM mode, both indices run over n, m = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Meanwhile, in TE mode, which has cosine solutions, because of the presence of two indices n and m one of either n or m can be zero. 75 14.1. Cylindrical Waveguide 14 Fourteenth Exercise Set 14.1 Cylindrical Waveguide Consider a waveguide with a circular cross section of radius a. Find the time-dependent solution for the electric and magnetic field in the waveguide, along with the dispersion relation, for both TM and TE propagation modes. We begin with the wave equation for either Ez or Hz in a pipe-like waveguide: [ ∇2 ⊥ + κ2] {Ez(x, y) Hz(x, y) } = 0. Next, we write the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates—in cylindrical geometry, the coordinates perpendicular to the propagation direction z are r and ϕ. The Laplacian reads: ∇2 ⊥ = 1 r ∂ ∂r ( r ∂ ∂r ) + 1 r2 ∂2 ∂ϕ2 . We begin with TM mode, in which we have Hz = 0 and solve for Ez. We find Ez with separation of variables, using the ansatz Ez(r, ϕ) = R(r)Φ(ϕ). We substitute this ansatz into wave equation and get 1 r (rR′)′ Φ + 1 r2 RΦ ′′ + κ 2RΦ = 0. We then rearrange and get rR′ + r2R′′ R + Φ′′ Φ + κ2r2 = 0 =⇒ r2R′′ + rR′ + κ2r2R R = − Φ′′ Φ = m 2, where, following the usual separation of variables recipe, we have set the r and ϕ-dependent terms equal to the separation constant m2. The two equations are Φ′′ + m 2Φ = 0 and r2R′′ + rR′ + (κ 2r2 − m 2)R = 0. The equation for Φ has a sinusoidal solution, which we write in the form Φ(ϕ) ∝ sin(mϕ + ϕm). Note that we’ve written the solution with a phase shift ϕm instead of as a linear combination of sine and cosine terms. The radial equation is a Bessel equation and is solved by the Bessel functions Jm and the Neumann functions Nm. The general solution is a linear combination of the form R(r) ∝ Jm(κr) + Nm(κr). 76 14.1. Cylindrical Waveguide The Neumann functions apply in situations with divergence near the origin (e.g. a coaxial cable), and the Bessel functions for convergence near the origin. Our problem is free of divergence near the origin, so we will use only the Bessel functions. In this case, the general solution for Ez = ΦR is Ez(r, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=0 AmJm(κmr) sin(mϕ + ϕm), where m indexes the Bessel functions. We now consider boundary conditions. The electric field in waveguides must satisfy E∥∣ ∣∂ = 0, where E∥ is the component of electric field tangent (parallel) to the waveguide’s surface and ∂ denotes the boundary surface. For our cylindrical geometry both Ez and Eϕ are tangent, and the boundary corresponds to r = a. We apply the condition to Ez to get Ez(a, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=0 AmJm(κa) sin(mϕ + ϕm) ≡ 0. This implies κ must satisfy Jm(κa) = 0 =⇒ κa = ξm,n, where m = 0, 1, 2, . . . indexes the Bessel functions and n = 1, 2, 3, . . . indexes the zero of the m-th Bessel function. The solution for κ is then κ = ξmn a , where the zeros ξmn are tabulated in the table below. As such, the general solution for Ez is more appropriately written with two indices in the form Ez(r, ϕ) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=0 AmnJm (ξmn r a ) sin(mϕ + ϕmn), where m indexes the Bessel functions and n indexes the zeros of a given Bessel function. n J0(x) J1(x) J2(x) J3(x) J4(x) J5(x) 1 2.4048 3.8317 5.1356 6.3802 7.5883 8.7715 2 5.5201 7.0156 8.4172 9.7610 11.0647 12.3386 3 8.6537 10.1735 11.6198 13.0152 14.3725 15.7002 4 11.7915 13.3237 14.7960 16.2235 17.6160 18.9801 5 14.9309 16.4706 17.9598 19.4094 20.8269 22.2178 Table 1: The first 5 zeros ξmn of the first 6 Bessel functions Jm(x). With κ known, we find the dispersion relation via κ 2 = ω2 c2 0 − k2 =⇒ ω = c0 √ k2 + ξ2 mn a2 . 77 14.1. Cylindrical Waveguide We then find the waveguide’s bandwidth from the difference between the lowest two frequency modes, which occur for the smallest two zeros ξmn when k = 0, where the dispersion relation simplifies to ω(k = 0) = c0 a ξmn. The bandwidth is then the difference between the two smallest possible frequencies ω, which occur for the two smallest values of ξmn. These are: ∆ω = c0 a (ξ11 − ξ10) ≈ c0 a (3.8317 − 2.4048) = 1.47 · c0 a . TE Mode In TE mode we have Ez = 0 and solve for Hz. As in TM, we use separation of variables with the ansatz Hz(r, ϕ) = R(r)Φ(ϕ). Following an analogous separation of variables procedure as in TM mode produces the general solution Hz(r, ϕ) = ∞∑ m=0 AmJm(κr) sin(mϕ + ϕm). In TE mode, we boundary condition applies to H⊥ and reads H⊥∣ ∣ ∂ = 0, meaning the component of H perpendicular to the surface ∂ must be zero. In cylindrical geometry the radial coordinate is perpendicular to the surface, meaning H⊥ = Hr. We find Hr with Hr ∝ ∂Hz ∂r and Hr∣ ∣ ∂ = 0 =⇒ ∂Hz ∂r = 0. Applying this boundary condition to the general solution for Hz gives J ′ m(κa) = 0 =⇒ κ = ξ′ mn a , where ξ′ mn are the zeros of the Bessel function derivatives, tabulated below. n J ′ 0(x) J ′ 1(x) J ′ 2(x) J ′ 3(x) J ′ 4(x) J ′ 5(x) 1 3.8317 1.8412 3.0542 4.2012 5.3175 6.4156 2 7.0156 5.3314 6.7061 8.0152 9.2824 10.5199 3 10.1735 8.5363 9.9695 11.3459 12.6819 13.9872 4 13.3237 11.7060 13.1704 14.5858 15.9641 17.3128 5 16.4706 14.8636 16.3475 17.7887 19.1960 20.5755 Table 2: The first 5 zeros ξmn of the first 6 Bessel function derivatives J ′ m(x). 78 14.2. Overview: Waveguide with a Quarter-Circle Cross Section The correct general solution for Hz is written with two indices in the form Hz(r, ϕ) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=0 AmnJm (ξ′ mn r a ) sin(mϕ + ϕmn), where m indexes the Bessel functions and n indexes the zeros of the Bessel function derivatives ξ′ mn. With κ known, the dispersion relation in TE mode is κ 2 = ω2 c2 0 − k2 =⇒ ω = c0 √ k2 + (ξ′ mn)2 a2 . We find the bandwidth analogously to TM mode, we just using the new zeros ξ′ mn instead. The difference between the lowest two frequencies is ∆ω = c0 a (ξ′ 21 − ξ11) ≈ c0 a (3.0542 − 1.8412) ≈ 1.21 · c0 a . 14.2 Overview: Waveguide with a Quarter-Circle Cross Section We briefly sketch the typical problem solving procedure for a waveguide with a quarter-circle cross section. As for a circular cross section, we work in cylindrical coordinates and use separation of variables with the ansatzes Ez(r, ϕ) = R(r)Φ(ϕ) or, in TE mode, Hz(r, ϕ) = R(r)Φ(ϕ). Substituting these ansatzes into the waveguide wave equation leads to the familiar general solutions {Ez(r, ϕ) Hz(r, ϕ) } = ∞∑ m=0 AmJm(κr) sin(mϕ + ϕm). Boundary Conditions in TM Mode A waveguide with quarter-circular cross section has two additional flat boundaries, in addition to its circular boundary. In TM mode, we require Ez(ϕ = 0, r) = 0 along the bottom flat surface and Ez(ϕ = π/2, r) = 0 along the vertical flat surface. The boundary conditions along the flat surfaces, which are conditions involving the co- ordinate ϕ, apply to the angular component of the general solution, i.e. sin(mϕ + ϕm). The first condition, Ez(0, r) = 0 requires ϕm = 0. The second condition, Ez(π/2, r) = 0, leads to sin (m π 2 ) = 0, which means m π 2 = nπ where n ∈ N. The result is m = 2, 4, 6, · · · . In other words, only even values of m are allowed. 79 14.3. Theory: TEM Waves in Waveguides Finding the radial component of the general solution is analogous to the procedure for a circular cross section and involves finding zeros of the Bessel functions. Boundary Conditions in TE Mode In TE mode, the relevant boundary condition involves the perpendicular magnetic field H⊥. Along the circular surface, the perpendicular magnetic field is Hr ∝ ∂Hz ∂r . Requiring H⊥ = 0 leads to the condition m = 0, 2, 4, 6, . . ., as in TE mode. Along the bottom flat surface at ϕ = 0, the perpendicular component of magnetic field is H⊥ = ∂Hz ∂ϕ . Applying the boundary condition H⊥ = 0 leads to cos(ϕm) = 0, which means the phase term is ϕm = π 2 . In other words, the angular solutions are cosine terms, since sin (mϕ + π 2 ) = cos(mϕ). Along the vertical flat surface at ϕ = π/2, the boundary condition reads H⊥ = ∂Hz ∂ϕ ( π 2 , r) = 0. This condition leads to the requirement m = 0, 2, 4, . . .. In TE mode, the case m = 0 is valid because the angular cosine solutions are constant and thus non-trivial, at m = 0. Similarly, the radial Bessel functions are nontrivial for m = 0, and we get a valid solution. In TE mode for a quarter-circle cross section, the valid values of m are thus m = 0, 2, 4, . . .. 14.3 Theory: TEM Waves in Waveguides In TEM (transverse electric and transverse magnetic) mode we have both Ez = 0 and Hz = 0, which is a more strict condition than either TE or TM mode individually. In TEM mode both E and H are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, i.e. both E and B are perpendicular to the wave vector k. We now E ⊥ k and B ⊥ k is satisfied for EM waves in empty space, and it turns out this condition is also possible is specialized waveguides, which we consider in this section. We begin the analysis of TEM waves in waveguides with the familiar ansatz E(r) = E(ρ)e i(kz−ωt), which assumes E propagates through the waveguide in the z direction. First Step Our first step is to show ∇ × E and ∇ × H obey the relationships ∇ × E = ik × E and ∇ × H = ik × H. We begin the proof with the intermediate calculation ∇ × E(r) = ∇ × [E(ρ)ei(kz−ωt)] = ∇ × E(ρ)ei(kz−ωt) + ∇e i(kz−ωt) × E(ρ), 80 14.3. Theory: TEM Waves in Waveguides where the second equation holds because the exponent term is a scalar quantity. Next, we make the calculation ∇e i(kz−ωt) = ikei(kz−ωt) =⇒ ∇e i(kz−ωt) × E(ρ) = ik × E(r). To show ∇ × E(r) = 0, we just need to show that the term ∇ × E(ρ)ei(kz−ωt) equals zero. Noting that ρ = (x, y, 0) i.e. the ρz = 0, and also that Ez ≡ 0 in TEM mode, we have ∇ × E(ρ)e i(kz−ωt) =   ∂ ∂x ∂ ∂y ∂ ∂z   ×   Ex(ρ) Ey(ρ) Ez(ρ)   e i(kz−ωt) =   ∂ ∂x ∂ ∂y 0   ×   Ex(ρ) Ey(ρ) 0   ei(kz−ωt) = ( ∂Ey(ρ) ∂x − ∂Ex(ρ) ∂y ) e i(kz−ωt) ˆz = [∇ × E(r)] z ˆz. Applying Maxwell’s equations shows that [∇ × E(r) ] z = µ0 ∂Hz ∂t ≡ 0, since Hz = 0 in TEM mode. The result is the desired equality ∇ × E = ik × E, where k = (0, 0, k). Proving ∇ × H = ik × H analogous; left as an exercise to the reader i.e. I’m too lazy to type it out right now. Second Step Next, we aim to prove that TEM mode has the dispersion relation ω = c0k. We begin with the just-derived equality ∇ × E = ik × E and proceed with ik × E = ∇ × E = −µ0 ∂H ∂t = +iµ0ωH =⇒ k × E = µ0ωH. Analogously, using ∇ × H = ik × H, we get ik × H = ∇ × H = ϵ0 ∂E ∂t = −iϵ0ωE =⇒ k × H = −ϵ0ωE. Next, we take the cross product of the above equations with k to get k × (k × E) = µ0ωk × H = −ϵ0µ0ω2E. The left hand side k × (k × E) evaluates to k × (k × E) = k(k · E) − k2E = 0 − k2E, since k · E = 0 in TEM mode. Using k × (k × E) = −ϵ0µ0ω2E leads to −k2E = −ϵ0µ0ω2E =⇒ E ( k2 − ω2 c2 0 ) = 0 =⇒ ω = c0k. 81 14.4. TEM Waves in a Coaxial Waveguide In other words, we have proven that TEM mode has the dispersion relation ω = c0k Last Step We begin with the waveguide wave equation, which reads [ ∇2 ⊥ + ( ω2 c2 0 − k2)] {E H } = 0. Because of the dispersion relation ω = ck, the equation simplifies to ∇2 ⊥ {E H } = 0. This equation corresponds to a solution with ω = 0 and k = 0, which corresponds to a static electromagnetic wave. Mathematically, this means TEM wave propagation reduces to solving a static (time-independent) Laplace equation. As an example, we consider the electric field E. Since ∇2 ⊥E = 0, (which applies to the entire electric field), we can also consider only the component E∥ and write ∇2 ⊥E∥ = 0. Meanwhile, the boundary condition for waveguides reads E∥∣ ∣ ∂ = 0. The Laplace equation for E∥ requires that the Laplacian of E∥ is zero everywhere along the waveguide cross section, while the boundary condition requires that E∥ itself is zero along the boundary. The only possible solution for simple2 surfaces is E∥ = 0. However, for e.g. a coaxial cable with an annular (not simple) cross section, E∥ ̸= 0 (and thus TEM mode) is a valid solution. Another possible waveguide that allows for TEM mode is a parallel-plate waveguide in which the plates extend to infinity, meaning the “infinite” cross section is not a simple surface. In general, only waveguides with non-simple cross sections can carry TEM waves. 14.4 TEM Waves in a Coaxial Waveguide Consider a coaxial waveguide with an inner conductor of radius a and an outer sheath of radius b. To make things more interesting, we fill the interior with a material with the same dielectric constant as the cold plasma in Subsection 12.2. Find the dispersion relation and impedance for TEM waves in the coaxial waveguide. Because the waveguide is filled with a dielectric material, the wave speed is c < c0, and the dispersion relation is ω = ck. The wave speeds c and c0 are related by c = c0√ϵ =⇒ ω = c0k √ϵ . 2By simple surface, we refer to a surface enclosed by a single boundary. For example, a circle would be a simple surface, but an annulus, which has two boundaries, is not. 82 14.4. TEM Waves in a Coaxial Waveguide We then substitute in the dielectric constant of cold plasma to get ω = c0k √ 1 − ω2 p ω2 =⇒ ω = √ c2 0k2 + ω2 p. Note that this is the same dispersion relation as for cold plasma, even though the plasma problem was solved in unbounded space, while the coaxial waveguide has bounded geometry. Impedance We find the waveguide’s impedance with the relationship Z = U I where U and I are the potential difference between the inner and outer sheath and the current through the conductor, respectively, corresponding to TEM waves in the waveguide. In TEM mode, the EM field is static, which simplifies finding U and I. We assume the coaxial cable carries a hypothetical current I. Using Ampere’s law, the current through the inner conductor leads to a tangential magnetic field Hϕ of the form I = Hϕ · 2πr =⇒ Hϕ = I 2πr , where Hϕ is the ϕ component of H (tangential to the waveguide’s circular cross section). Next, assume a potential difference U between the inner and outer conductors. We find the associated radial electric field Er using Gauss’s law: Q = ϵ0ϵ · 2πrl · Er =⇒ Er = Q 2πϵϵ0lr , where q is the charge on the inner conductor. Note that because of the coaxial conductor’s concentric geometry, E has only a radial component and H has only a tangential component. With Er known, we find the associated potential difference with U = ˆ b a Er dr = q wπϵϵ0l ˆ b a dr r =⇒ U = q 2πϵϵ0l ln b a . We can relate U and Er with U = Err ln b a . Next, we substitute U and I into the impedance equation to get Z = U I = 1 2π Er Hϕ ln b a . We can relate Er and Hϕ with the earlier theoretical TEM result H = k ωµ0 × E. Since E = (Er, 0, 0) and H = (0, Hϕ, 0) are perpendicular, the above vector equation simplifies to Hϕ = k ωµ0 Er = 1 cµ0 Er = √ ϵϵ0µ0 µ2 0 Er = √ϵ Z0 Er, 83 14.4. TEM Waves in a Coaxial Waveguide where Z0 = 1√ϵ0µ0 is the impedance of free space. We substitute this result for Hϕ in terms of Er into the impedance equation to get Z = Z0 2π√ ϵ ln b a = 1 2π Z0√ 1 − ω2 p ω2 ln b a . 84","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
