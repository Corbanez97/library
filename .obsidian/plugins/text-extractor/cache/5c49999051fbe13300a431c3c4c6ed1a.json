For a given set of probabil- ities {pi}, the information is H = − ∑ i pi log pi . (1.1) Remarkably, this is simply Boltzmann’s formula for the entropy (of which more later). We can sum up the fundamental lessons learned from Bayes and from Shannon as follows: Bayes taught us that probabilities are not absolute but rather depend on available information. Shannon showed that information itself is a precisely deﬁned function of the probabilities. Shannon’s work was aimed, initially, at the problem of providing a quantitative theory of communications, but any set of probabilities can be associated with a quan- tity of information and it follows that any probabilistic phenomenon has an associated information theory. This idea has been applied, for example, to statistical mechanics (Jaynes 1957a, 1957b). Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory, of course, and so it was inevitable that a quantum information theory would be developed. 1.2 Probabilities and conditional probabilities Consider an event A with possible outcomes {ai}. Everything we know is speciﬁed by the probabilities for the possible outcomes: {P (ai)}. For tossing a fair coin, for example, the outcomes are ‘heads’ and ‘tails’ with P (heads) = 1 Entropy and information 3 = P (ai|bj)P (bj) . (1.5) Bayes’ theorem utilises this rule to relate the two conditional probabilities: P (ai|bj) = P (bj|ai)P (ai) 4 Classical Information Theory We can absorb the prefactor K into the choice of base for the logarithm. A convenient choice is to use base 2 so that H = − ∑ i P (ai) log2 P (ai) bits , (1.10) which is Shannon’s formula for the information. Henceforth we shall drop the subscript 2. It is sometimes convenient, especially in analytical calculations, to use the natural base of logarithms, base e, which gives the entropy in nats: He = − ∑ i P (ai) ln P (ai) nats . (1.11) It is straightforward to show that He = H ln 2, so that 1 nat = ln 2 bits. For two events A and B we can write informations for the joint events or for the single events: H(A, B) = − ∑ i,j P (ai, bj) log P (ai, bj) H(A) = − ∑ i,j P (ai, bj) log ∑ k P (ai, bk) H(B) = − ∑ i,j P (ai, bj) log ∑ l P (al, bj) . (1.12) We can also deﬁne information based in the conditional probabilities. An especially useful measure of correlation between the two events is the mutual information: H(A : B) = H(A) + H(B) − H(A, B) . (1.13) This has the important properties that it is positive or zero and that it takes the value zero if and only if the events are independent: H(A : B) ≥ 0 H(A : B) = 0 iﬀ P (ai, bj) = P (ai)P (bj) ∀i, j . (1.14) It is the mutual information that provides an upper bound on the rate at which we can communicate. A more detailed (but gentle) discussion of these entropies and exploration of their properties may be found in (Barnett 2009). 1.4 Information and thermodynamics The fact that the mathematical form of the information is also the entropy begs the question as to whether information entropy is the same quantity that appears in statistical mechanics. It is! An important and simple example is the way in which we can obtain the Boltzmann distribution by maximising the information (what we have yet to discover) subject only to a constraint on the average energy. This is such a nice calculation that I cannot Information and thermodynamics 5 resist the temptation to include it here, even though there was not time to present it in my lectures. Let a quantum system have a set of discrete energy levels Ei and be in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment. Our task is to determine the probability, pi, that the system is to be found in any one of its given energy levels, Ei. Of course we know how to do this by maximising the entropy, but information theory gives us a rather diﬀerent take on the problem; we maximise the information of the system subject to the constraint only that its mean energy is ﬁxed. In this way we maximise, in an unbiased manner, our uncertainty about the state. The derivation is readily performed as a variational calculation using Lagrange’s method of unde- termined multipliers (Boas 1983). It is convenient to work with the natural base of logarithms in this case and so we deﬁne the information to be He = − ∑ i pi ln pi . (1.15) Our task is to maximise this quantity subject to a ﬁxed mean energy, ∑ i piEi = ¯E, and the probabilities summing to unity, ∑i pi = 1. We can achieve this by varying, independently, the probabilities in the function ˜H = He + λ ( 1 − ∑ i pi ) + β ( ¯E − ∑ i piEi ) . (1.16) We ﬁnd d ˜H = ∑ i (− ln pi − 1 − λ − βEi) dpi . (1.17) We require this to be stationary (zero) for all dpi, which leads to the solution pi = e−1−λe−βEi . (1.18) We can ﬁx the value of the undetermined multipliers by enforcing the normalisation of the probabilities and the value of the average energy to arrive at the familiar Boltzmann distribution: pi = exp (−Ei/(kBT )) 6 Classical Information Theory Q=W W (e) (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 1.1 Szilard’s illustration of the connection between information and (thermodynamic) entropy. Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). Applying the ideal gas law, P V = kBT , (1.20) to our single-molecule gas allows us to calculate the work extracted from the expanding gas in an isothermal expansion: W = ∫ V0 V0/2 P dV = kBT ln 2 . (1.21) We have extracted useful work from the reservoir in apparent conﬂict with the second law of thermodynamics. The second law can be saved, however, if the process of mea- suring and recording the position of the molecule produces an entropy change of not less than ∆S = kB ln 2 . (1.22) Szilard concludes, in this way, a direct link between information and thermodynamic entropy. Information and thermodynamics 7 (a) (b) (c) (d) Q=W W 0 1 0 Fig. 1.2 Illustration of Landauer’s derivation of the thermodynamic cost of information erasure. Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). A more precise statement is that to complete the thermodynamic cycle, we need to include the process of the observer forgetting in which side the molecule was found. The process of forgetting was studied by Landauer (1961, Leﬀ and Rex 1994, Plenio and Vitteli 2001). He considered a single-molecule gas, like Szilard’s, and proposed using the position of the molecule to represent a logical bit: the molecule being to the left of the partion corresponding to a logical 0 and to the right corresponding to a logical 1. Landauer showed that erasing and resetting the bit to 0 requires the dissipation of at least kBT ln 2 worth of energy as heat. To see this we can simply remove the membrane (a reversible process) and then push in, slowly, a fresh partition from the right, as depicted in Fig. 1.2. When the partition reached halfway the ‘memory’ has been reset to the bit value 0 and, of course, all trace of the original bit value has been lost. The work that needs to be done to achieve this is W = − ∫ V0/2 V0 P dV = kBT ln 2 , (1.23) and this is dissipated, of course, as heat. We can view this as a resolution of the paradox implicit in Szilard’s model. This is not the end of the story, however. It has recently been shown that Landauer’s limit can be beaten if we pay a cost, not in energy, but in some other quantity such as angular momentum (Vaccaro and Barnett 2011). The key idea to take from these models, however, is unaﬀected: information is physical. 8 Classical Information Theory 1.5 Communications Theory Shannon ﬁrst introduced his information theory as a/the mathematical theory of com- munication (Shannon 1948, Shannon and Weaver 1949). In doing so he introduced the very general model of a communications system depicted in Fig. 1.3. Let us analyse this by introducing two characters, Alice and Bob, who have become very popular in quantum communications. Alice wishes to send a message to Bob. Alice’s event, A, is the selection of the message from a set of possible messages {ai}. Bob’s event, B, is detecting the message from the possible set {bj}. On Alice’s side there is an informa- tion source, which produces the choice of message to be sent (this may be Alice herself, of course) and a transmitter which produces the signal (electrical, optical, acoustical or even a piece of paper) ready for transmission. The signal propagates from Alice to Bob and, whilst en route, is subject to noise. Bob receives the noisy signal and his receiving device turns the signal into a message. BobAlice SignalInformation source Transmitter Received signal Receiver Destination Noise source Fig. 1.3 Shannon’s model of a communications channel. Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). The limiting performance of such a communications channel is governed by two theorems derived by Shannon (Shannon 1948, Shannon and Weaver 1949): his noiseless coding theorem, which tells us how much a message can be compressed and still be read, and his noisy channel coding theorem, which tells us how much redundancy is needed to correct errors. 1.5.1 Noiseless coding theorem Most messages have an element of redundancy and can be compressed but still be readable. As an example, you might like to try this one1: THS LS HCHS SCHL HS NTRSTNG LCTRS I compressed the message by removing the vowels. Shannon’s noiseless coding theorem quantiﬁes the redundancy in a message. Two simple examples are that in English we mostly don’t need to put a ‘u’ after ‘q’ and a three-letter word beginning with ‘th’ will almost certainly be ‘the’. 1If you are having diﬃculty, the message is THiS LeS HouCHeS SCHooL HaS iNTeReSTiNG LeCTuReS. Communications Theory 9 Shannon’s theorem shows us the typical number of bits we need to encode a message eﬃciently. It is the entropy associated with the probabilities for the messages that is the key quantity. If we have one of a set of messages that is N bits long, for example 010 · · · 111︸ 10 Classical Information Theory which is the bound provided by Shannon’s theorem. The fact that Shannon’s value is reached in this case tells us, moreover, that no better coding is possible: this is the shortest possible length of the message. 1.5.2 Noisy coding theorem The presence of noise on the communications channel will introduce errors in the received signal. We can combat these errors by introducing some redundancy, indeed this is undoubtedly the reason why language evolved already containing redundancy. As a simple example, let us suppose that any given bit in the message is ‘ﬂipped’ with probability q and so produces an error. How much redundancy do we need to be able to detect and correct these errors? Shannon’s noisy coding theorem tells us that, on average, we require at least N0 2 Quantum Communications and Quantum Key Distribution 12 Quantum Communications and Quantum Key Distribution scalar product, the Pauli operator for an arbitrary direction associated with the unit vector a: a · ˆσ = ax ˆσx + ay ˆσy + az ˆσz . (2.3) The product rule for two such operators is then (a · ˆσ)(b · ˆσ) = (a · b)ˆI + i(a × b) · ˆσ . (2.4) as may readily be veriﬁed. 2.2 Information security The use of a quantum communications channel makes three essential modiﬁcations or additions to Shannon’s model. The ﬁrst is that the signal sent by Alice is encoded on the quantum state of a physical system sent to Bob. This means that each signal ai is associated with a quantum state with corresponding density operator ˆρi. In addition to any intrinsic noise in the channel, we have a special role for any eavesdropper who might be listening in. This is because in order to extract any information, the eavesdropper needs to perform a measurement and, as we know, a measurement will, in general, modify the state of the observed system. Finally, Bob cannot determine the state of the system but rather has to settle for measuring one observable. Hence Bob must choose what to measure. All of these elements are essential in quantum communications and it is the combination that, in particular, makes quantum key distribution possible. Before I get to that, let us set the scene by looking at secure communications is general. In the information age we are all aware of the importance and diﬃculty of keep- ing information secure. The science that today underpins this eﬀort is cryptography (Piper and Murphy 2002). The history of secure communications and keeping informa- tion secure, however, is a long and interesting one (Singh 1999, 2000). For important communications we might try enciphering a message to keep it safe. The simplest such scheme, at least conceptually, is the single-key cryptosystem. The principal idea is that Alice and Bob share a secret key (a number) which Alice can use to generate the cipher-text and Bob can use to decipher it. The general scheme is depicted in Fig.2.1. We can write the transformation, formally, involving the plaintext P, the key K and the ciphertext C. The ciphertext is a function of the plaintext and the key, to be calculated by Alice, and the plaintext may be recovered by Bob as a function of the ciphertext and the key: C = C(P, K) P = P(C, K) . (2.5) For example in a substitution cipher we replace each letter with a symbol. In principle there are 26! ≈ 4 × 1026 possible substitution ciphers, so an exhaustive search is completely impractical. A substitution cipher is easily cracked, however, using the known letter frequencies. For Information security 13 E avesdropping T ampering unpr otected crypto-key (secret) crypto-key (secret) inverse mathematical transformation BobAlice mathematical transformation data unprotected data data unprotected data Hostile Network Protected data Fig. 2.1 Elements of a secret communications channel. Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). example the most common symbol will be E which occurs 12.7% of the time, while Q makes up only about 0.1% of the symbols (or perhaps a bit more in these notes!). Sherlock Holmes makes use of precisely this technique in one of his cases (Conan Doyle 1903). It was Shannon who gave us an objective criterion for perfect secrecy (Shannon 1949). Let {pi} be the set of possible plaintexts (messages) and {cj} be the set of possible cipher texts. Shannon’s criterion for perfect secrecy is P (pi|cj) = P (pi) ∀ i, j . (2.6) A straightforward application of Bayes’ theorem shows that this is equivalent to P (cj|pi) = P (cj) ∀ i, j . (2.7) This means that discovering or intercepting the ciphertext does not provide any in- formation on the plaintext. The second condition states that any given ciphertext is equally likely to have been generated by any plaintext. A question that you might like to ponder is how many possible keys does this require? The simplest perfectly secure cipher is the Vernam cipher, or one-time pad. It uses a key in the form of a random sequence of bits, · · · 101110 · · ·, that is at least as long as the plaintext (which is also a sequence of bits, of course). The ciphertext is produces by bit-wise modulo addition of the plaintext and the key: 0 ⊕ 0 = 0 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 1 ⊕ 0 = 1 1 ⊕ 1 = 0 . (2.8) A simple example is P · · · 0011010100 · · · K · · · 1011101000 · · · 14 Quantum Communications and Quantum Key Distribution C = P ⊕ K · · · 1000111100 · · · . The cipertext C is random because the key K is random. Deciphering is performed by Bob by a second modulo addition of the key. This works because K ⊕ K = · · · 0000000 · · ·: C · · · 1000111100 · · · K · · · 1011101000 · · · P = C ⊕ K · · · 0011010100 · · · . Clearly the secrecy of the key is crucial, as anyone in possession of it can decipher the message. The remaining problem, of course, is how can Alice and Bob exchange the key K? To see how this and other secure communications are realised in practice we need to introduce public-key cryptography, which is based on the fact that some mathematical operations are easy but the inverse inverse operation is very diﬃcult and, hopefully, eﬀectively impossible in practice (Buchmann 2001, Loepp and Wootters 2006, Barnett 2009). The classic example is multiplying and factoring. In public-key cryptography Bob generates two keys, an enciphering key e and a deciphering key d. He publishes e but keeps d secret. Alice can use e to encode her message which should be all but impossible (she hopes!) for anyone other than Bob to decipher. This is the RSA cryptosystem (Buchmann 2001, Loepp and Wootters 2006, Barnett 2009). RSA scheme 1. Bob ﬁnds two large prime numbers, p and q, and calculates m = p × q. This is easy. 2. He then ﬁnds two numbers e and d such that de = 1 modulo (p − 1)(q − 1). There are eﬃcient algorithms for doing this if you know p and q. 3. The public key is m and e. The private key is d. 4. Alice takes her message, which is a number x, and turns it into a ciphertext by the transformation x → x e modulo m 5. By the wonders of pure mathematics (actually it is not so hard to prove this) (x emodulo m) d modulo m = x moludo m , which is the original message. So Bob can recover the message using his secret key d. The security of the RSA scheme is believed to be equivalent to the diﬃculty of factoring m into its constituent primes p and q. It is certainly true that if p and q are known then ﬁnding d from e and m is straightforward. How big does m have to be? Numbers of order 1090 can be factored in less than a day, so much larger numbers are needed. There is an RSA factoring chal- lenge, which you might like to try. The number RSA-212, which is ≈ 7 × 10212 was Quantum copying? 15 factored in July 2012 to claim a $30,000 prize. There is currently a $75,000 prize to anyone who can produce the two prime factors of the 270 decimal digit number (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA accessed October 21 (2013)): RSA-896 = 4120234369866595438555313653325759481798116998443279828454556 264338764455652484261980988704231618418792614202471888694925609317763750 334211309823974851509449091069102698610318627041148808669705649029036536 58867433731720813104105190864254793282601391257624033946373269391 Public key cryptography is routinely used to distribute keys and for proof of identity via so-called digital signatures. 2.3 Quantum copying? Quantum key distribution is a radically diﬀerent approach to secure communications. It relies on the diﬃculty for anyone eavesdropping in determining the quantum signal generated by Alice. Before describing this in detail, we show that it is impossible to copy an unknown quantum state. This is the famous no-cloning theorem of Wootters and Zurek (1982) and of Dieks (1982). It works by exposing a contradiction. Suppose that you are given a qubit in some unknown (to you) quantum state: |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ , (2.9) that is, you do not know the amplitudes α and β. Clearly you could do a measurement but that will not tell you |ψ⟩. What you would like to achieve is a transformation on this quit and a ‘blank’ prepared in the state |B⟩ such that |ψ⟩ ⊗ |B⟩ → |ψ⟩ ⊗ |ψ⟩ ∀ |ψ⟩ . (2.10) Let us suppose that this works if |ψ⟩ = |0⟩ or |1⟩, so that |0⟩ ⊗ |B⟩ → |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ |1⟩ ⊗ |B⟩ → |1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ . (2.11) The superposition principle then tells us that for a general state |ψ⟩ the corresponding transformation is |ψ⟩ ⊗ |B⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ |B⟩ → α|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ + β|1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ̸= (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) . (2.12) So it necessarily follows from the superposition principle that a quantum cloner cannot work perfectly for all quantum states. Having established that strictly exact cloning of an unknown state is not possible, we might very reasonably ask what is the best that is possible. There has been a great deal of work on this topic, but probably the most important is the universal quantum-copying machine the operation of which is the best possible with the same performance for all possible input qubit states (Buˇzek and Hillery 1996, Scarani et al 2005). 16 Quantum Communications and Quantum Key Distribution 2.4 Optical polarization Recall that for a plane wave, the electric ﬁeld ⃗E, the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗H and the wave- vector ⃗k are all mutually orthogonal and are oriented such that ⃗E × ⃗H points in the direction of ⃗k see Fig. 2.2 . This ﬁxes ⃗E and ⃗H to be in the plane perpendicular to ⃗k. E H k Fig. 2.2 Relative orientations of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and the wavevector. Repro- duced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). Consider a complex electric ﬁeld for a plane wave propagating in the z-direction: ⃗E = ⃗E0ei(kz−ωt) . (2.13) We can characterise the polarization by the direction of the complex vector ⃗E0 in the x − y plane ⃗E0 = E0x⃗ı + E0y⃗ (2.14) or as a column vector, the Jones vector, ⃗E0 = [ E0x E0y ] . (2.15) Only the relative sizes of E0x and E0y matter, so we can use a normalized Jones vector. The Jones vectors corresponding to horizontal/vertical, diagonal and circular polarizations are depicted in Fig. 2.3. For a single photon we can associate each of the Jones vectors with a qubit state according to the mapping [ α β ] → α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ , (2.16) which leads to the identiﬁcations listed in Fig. 2.4. This simple idea has been used widely in experimental demonstrations of a variety of quantum information and com- munications protocols, most especially in quantum cryptography. 2.5 Quantum cryptography Quantum cryptography, or perhaps more precisely quantum key distribution, has be- come an advanced experimental technique and is on the verge, perhaps, of becoming a Quantum cryptography 17 Horizontal Vertical Diagonal up Diagonal down Left circular Right circular 1       0       1 2 1       1 2 1 −1       1 2 1 i       1 2 1      i −i Fig. 2.3 Linear and circular polarizations, together with their Jones vectors.

In these lectures I can give only a very brief overview of the topic and, for a more complete description, refer the reader to some of the introductory literature on the subject (Phoenix and Townsend 1995, Bouwmeester et al 2000, Gisin et al 2002, Loepp and Wootters 2006, Van Assche 2006, Barnett 2009). The idea of using quantum eﬀects for security is due to Stephen Wiesner (1983) who suggested (in a paper written in about 1970 but published only much later) the idea of unforgeable money. He supposed a high-value banknote worth, say, £10M . Each ‘note’ would have traps for 20 single photons, each of which was prepared in one of the polarization states |0⟩, |1⟩, 1 Quantum cryptography 19 Quantum money is impractical but Bennett and Brassard (1984) proposed a variant on this idea: quantum key distribution. The idea is that Alice associates the bit values 0 and 1 with a linear polarization state (either horizontal/vertical or diagonal/anti- diagonal): H or D ←→ 0 V or A ←→ 1 . (2.17) Suppose that Alice prepares a vertically polarised photon and that Bob measures the state in the horizontal/vertical basis. An eavesdropper, Eve, does not know that the photon was prepared in this basis and so can only make a choice of what to measure. In this way she will introduce, for 1 20 Quantum Communications and Quantum Key Distribution It remains only to determine whether an eavesdropper has been listening in. To determine whether this has happened or not, Alice and Bob can publicly reveal a subset of their shared data and look for errors. An example of what might be expected to happen is depicted in Fig. 2.7. Alice and Bob delete those bits associated with time-bins 1, 3, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18 and 20, in which the preparation and measurement were performed using diﬀerent bases. In time slots 2, 4, 11, 14, 15, and 19, Eve used a diﬀerent basis to Alice and Bob and of these, this led to a diﬀerence in the recorded bit values for Alice and Bob in time-bins 4, 11 and 14. The probability that Eve has been active and does not cause an error is then ( 3 3 Generalized Measurements 22 Generalized Measurements measurement of ˆA and ﬁnd the value λn, then we know that the post-measurement state is |λn⟩ and repeating the measurement, if it is done quickly enough, should give the same result. There is one further point that we need to consider, which is that the eigenvalues of ˆA might be degenerate, which means that a set of orthonormal eigenvectors, |λ j n⟩, will correspond to the same measurement outcome, λn. To incorporate this case, it is useful to introduce a projector onto the set of states with a common eigenvalue: ˆPn = ∑ j |λ j n⟩⟨λ j n| . (3.5) The probability that the measurement will give the result λn is then P (λn) = ∑ j ⟨λ j n|ˆρ|λ j n⟩ = Tr (ˆρ ˆPn) . (3.6) The post-measurement state will simply be that part of the pre-measurement state that was in the subspace spanned by the corresponding eigenstates or, in other words, that part of the state selected by the projector. Hence if our measurement gives the result λn then the density matrix changes as ˆρ → ˆPn ˆρ ˆPn Non-ideal measurements 23 3.2 Non-ideal measurements Most measurements are not of the form described in the preceding section. Consider, for example, the operation of a photodetector. Real photodetectors have a ﬁnite ef- ﬁciency and so do note resolve perfectly the number of photons. In detecting the photons, moreover, the detector absorbs the light and so leaves the ﬁeld in its zero- photon (or vacuum) state. Hence neither the von Neumann forms for the detection probabilities nor for the post-measurement state are appropriate and something more general is required. As a simple example, both of the problem and of how we might proceed, let us consider a measurement of a spin-component for a single quit. The ideal measurement would correspond to the pair of projectors ˆP0 = |0⟩⟨0| ˆP1 = |1⟩⟨1| . (3.8) Suppose that our detector gives the wrong answer with probability p so that the two possible measurement results occur with probabilities P (0) = (1 − p)Tr (ˆρ ˆP0) + pTr (ˆρ ˆP1) P (1) = (1 − p)Tr (ˆρ ˆP1) + pTr (ˆρ ˆP0) , (3.9) the sum of which is clearly unity, as it should be. We can write these in a form reminiscent of the von Neumann expressions, P (0) = Tr (ˆρˆπ0) P (1) = Tr (ˆρˆπ0) , (3.10) by introducing the probability operators ˆπ0 = (1 − p) ˆP0 + p ˆP1 ˆπ1 = (1 − p) ˆP1 + p ˆP0 . (3.11) These operators satisfy the ﬁrst three properties that we listed for the projectors, they are Hermitian, positive and complete. They are not orthonormal, however: ˆπ0 ˆπ1 = p(1 − p)ˆI . (3.12) This is our ﬁrst indication of a more general description of the measurement process, which we develop further below. 3.3 Probability operator measures To calculate the portability for any given result of a generalized measurement we need a probability rule and, in particular, a set of operators that characterise the measure- ment, one for each of the possible measurement outcomes. The required operators are 24 Generalized Measurements the probability operators, the set of which is a probability operator measure or a posi- tive operator-valued measure (Helstrom 1976, Holevo 1982, 2001, Peres 1993, Barnett 2009). That the ﬁrst three of the properties we listed for the projectors have physical signiﬁcance, but the third does not, tells us in what way we are allowed to generalise the von Neumann description; we simply drop the fourth and ﬁnal property from our list. Hence we describe any measurement by a set of probability operators {ˆπm} such that the probability for getting measurement outcome m is Pm = Tr (ˆρˆπm) , (3.13) where the probability operators have the following three properties Properties of probability operators 1. They are Hermitian, ˆπn = ˆπ† n. 2. They are positive operators, ˆπn ≥ ˆI. 3. They are complete, ∑ n ˆπn = ˆI. We should emphasise that there is no restriction on the number of probability oper- ators; the number can be greater or less than the dimension of the state space. For example, we shall analyse an example in which a generalised measurement on a qubit which has three outcomes, even though the dimension of the state space is only 2. There is no need, moreover, for the probability operators to commute with each other. The set of probability operators characterising a measurement is called a proba- bility operator measure (or POM) which you will also ﬁnd called a positive operator- valued measure (POVM). The latter has become the commonly used expression, but I prefer the former3. The description of a measurement in terms of a POM is very useful because of two points: 1. All measurements can be described in this way. (This is at least reasonable given the physical signiﬁcance of the three properties used to deﬁne a POM.) 2. Any set of the probability operators (that is any POM) is realisable, at least in principle, in the laboratory. This combination is very useful because if we seek to ﬁnd the best possible measure- ment in any situation, we can separate out the purely mathematical optimisation of the POM from the experimental question of how to achieve it. That any POM is re- alisable as a measurement is a consequence of Naimark’s theorem. We shall not prove this here but rather give an indication of how it works. A more complete presentation may be found in (Barnett 2009). The key idea is to map the generalized measurement onto a projective, or von Neumann, measurement in an extended state space. To see 3POM or POVM? The term ‘probability operator measure’ tells us that the elements forming the measure are the probability operators. The more popular expression ‘positive operator-valued measure’ expresses the fact that the elements of the measure, the probability operators, are positive operators. Calling the set of operators a POM reminds us of their physical signiﬁcance, while the term POVM recalls their mathematical properties. Probability operator measures 25 how this might be done, consider as quantum system s, which we wish to measure, and let us prepare also an ancillary quantum system a, so that we know its initial state. The state of the combined system and ancilla is then |ψ⟩s ⊗ |A⟩a. Next we engineer an interaction between the system and the ancilla, so that a unitary transformation of our choosing occurs: |ψ⟩s ⊗ |A⟩a → ˆU |ψ⟩s ⊗ |A⟩a . (3.14) Finally, we perform a von Neumann measurement on both the system and the ancilla, so that the probability for a given outcome will be P (m, l) = ∣ ∣ ∣s⟨m| ⊗ a⟨l| ˆU |ψ⟩s ⊗ |A⟩a∣ ∣ ∣ 2 = s⟨ψ|ˆπml|ψ⟩s , (3.15) where ˆπml = a⟨A| ˆU †|m⟩s ⊗ |l⟩aa⟨l| ⊗ s⟨m| ˆU |A⟩a , (3.16) which is an operator acting only on the system state space. It is clearly Hermitian and positive. That it sums to the identity follows, moreover, from the completeness of the orthonomal states {|m⟩s} and {|l⟩a}. It follows that the operators ˆπml are probability operators. Let us give a simple but important example of a generalised measurement; the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle. This is some- thing that we do all the time in our predominantly classical world but, because position and momentum are incompatible observables, cannot be described as a von Neumann measurement. Let us write the probability density for a joint measurement to give a position between xm and xm + dxm and also a momentum between pm and pm + dpm as P(xm, pm) = Tr [ˆρˆπ(xm, pm)] , (3.17) where the ˆπ(xm, pm) are positive operators satisfying the continuum condition ∫ ∞ −∞ dxm ∫ ∞ −∞ dpmˆπ(xm, pm) = ˆI ⇒ ∫ ∞ −∞ dxm ∫ ∞ −∞ dpmP(xm, pm) = 1 . (3.18) A good simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a body will localise rather well both quantities. In order to produce a plausible measurement op- erator, let us introduce a Gaussian state: |xm, pm⟩ = (2πσ2) −1/4 ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp [ − (x − xm) 2 26 Generalized Measurements Comparing this with our normalisation condition leads us to identify our probability operators as ˆπ(xm, pm) = 1 Optimized measurements 27 ˆπ1 + ˆπ2 = ˆI . (3.25) From our ﬁrst condition, ⟨ψ1|ˆπ1|ψ1⟩ = 1, we can write ˆπ1 = |ψ1⟩⟨ψ1| + ˆA , (3.26) where ˆA is a Hermitian, positive operator such that ⟨ψ1| ˆA|ψ1⟩ = 0, which implies that ˆA|ψ1⟩ = 0. From this it follows that ⟨ψ2|ˆπ1|ψ2⟩ = |⟨ψ2|ψ1⟩|2 + ⟨ψ2| ˆA|ψ2⟩ (3.27) which, being the sum of a positive quantity and a quantity greater than or equal to zero, must be greater than zero. Hence we cannot discriminate between these states perfectly. A natural question then is “what is the best we can do?”. The answer de- pends, of course, on what we mean by ‘best’. Here we consider only two such strategies: measurement with the minimum probability of error and unambiguous state discrim- ination. 3.4.1 Maximum probability of being correct Consider the following task, motivated by our discussion of quantum communications. We are given a quantum system which we know to have been prepared in one of a set of possible states { ˆρj} and also the probabilities, {pj}, that each state was prepared. We seek to identify the state with the maximum probability of being correct or, equivalently, with the minimum value of the error probability. Hence we construct a POM with probability operators {ˆπj} and associate each measurement outcome, ˆπj, with the corresponding state ˆρj and then minimise the quantity Perror = 1 − ∑ j pjTr (ˆρj ˆπj ) . (3.28) Remarkably, the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for reaching this minimum are known (Holevo 1973, Helstrom 1976, Barnett 2009): ˆπj (pj ˆρj − pk ˆρk) ˆπk = 0 ∑ i pi ˆρi ˆπi − pj ˆρj ≥ 0 . (3.29) A simple derivation of these is given in (Barnett and Croke 2009a). These conditions do not provide a direct means to construct the minimum error measurement and, indeed, there are many cases in which the strategy for measuring with minimum probability of error is not unique. Our strategy, therefore, is to try a measurement strategy and if it satisﬁes these conditions then we know it is optimal. The problem is usually a tractable one where there is some symmetry amongst the set of possible states and the minimum-error strategy has been derived in a variety of cases (Cheﬂes 2000, Paris and ˇReh´aˇcek 2004, Bergou 2007, Barnett 2009, Barnett and Croke 2009b). If we have just two possible states, ˆρ1 and ˆρ1, then the minimum-error measurement is known: we need only perform a projective (or von Neumann) measurement in which 28 Generalized Measurements the two measurement outcomes correspond to projectors onto the positive and negative eigenvalues of p1 ˆρ1 − p2 ˆρ2, corresponding, respectively, to identifying the state as ˆρ1 and ˆρ1. This gives as the minimum error probability the Helstrom bound: P min error = 1 Optimized measurements 29 ψ >2 ψ >1 π >1 ^ π >2 ^ >1 >0 Fig. 3.1 Orientation in state space of the two non-orthogonal states to be discriminated and the directions along which it is best to measure.

Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). 30 Generalized Measurements 3.4.2 Unambiguous discrimination We have found the minimum-error strategy for discriminating between a pair of equiprobable qubit states, |ψ1⟩ and |ψ2⟩, but can we determine the state for cer- tain? This might sound like a contradiction but it is not if we allow for the possibility of an ambiguous measurement outcome. To see this, consider the von Neumann mea- surement in which the projectors are ˆP1 = |ψ1⟩⟨ψ1| ˆP¯1 = |ψ⊥ 1 ⟩⟨ψ⊥ 1 | , (3.36) where |ψ⊥ 1 ⟩ is the state orthogonal to |ψ1⟩. If we get the result ¯1 then we know for certain that the state was not |ψ1⟩ and hence that it must have been |ψ2⟩. If we get the result 1, however, then the state could have been either |ψ1⟩ or |ψ2⟩ and the outcome is ambiguous. Hence this simple measurement strategy determines the state unambiguously but only some of the time. It is natural to ask if we can ﬁnd an optimal unambiguous discrimination strategy (Ivanovic 1987, Dieks 1988, Peres 1988, Cheﬂes 2000, Barnett 2009, Barnett and Croke 2009b). By this we mean a measurement strategy that identiﬁes the state unambigu- ously with the highest probability or, equivalently, produces the smallest probability for an ambiguous outcome. The optimal strategy in this case is the three-element POM with probability operators ˆπ1 = 1 Operations and the post-measurement state 31 3.5 Operations and the post-measurement state We have not as yet addressed the question of how the measurement process modiﬁes the quantum state in a generalized measurement 4. There are two pressing reasons for proceeding beyond the von Neumann ideal in which the quantum system is left in an eigenstate corresponding to the measurement outcome. The ﬁrst is that most real measurements are more destructive than this, and the second is that it gives us no idea how to describe the post measurement state for a generalised, that is non-projective, measurement. A rigorous treatment takes us into the mathematical world of eﬀects and operations (Kraus K 1983). Rather than this, we present only an indication of what is required. For a more complete treatment we refer the reader to (Croke et al 2008, Barnett 2009). We start by noting that quantum theory is linear in the density operator and this suggests that an allowed transformation of the density operator should be of the form ˆρ → ˆρ′ = ∑ i ˆAi ˆρ ˆBi . (3.38) Not every set of operators { ˆAi, ˆBi} will be allowed, however, as the transformed density operator must, itself, be a density operator. This means that it must be Hermitian, ˆρ′ = ˆρ′†, it must be positive, ⟨ψ|ˆρ′|ψ⟩ ≥ 0, and it must have unit trace, Trˆρ′ = 1. The ﬁrst of these conditions suggests that we should set ˆBi = ˆA † i and doing so automatically ensures that the second is fulﬁlled. The ﬁnal one, the preservation of the unit trace, is satisﬁed if we set ∑i ˆA † i ˆAi = ˆI. The operator ˆA † i ˆAi is positive and also Hermitian. The fact that we require the sum of these products to equal the identity operator, moreover, suggests the natural identiﬁcation ˆπi = ˆA † i ˆAi , (3.39) and this allows us to complete the required description of the change of state after a measurement. If we know that a measurement has been performed but do not know the measurement outcome then the density operator is transformed as ˆρ → ∑ i ˆAi ˆρ ˆA † i . (3.40) If we know that measurement result i was recorded, however, then the state is trans- formed as ˆρ → ˆAi ˆρ ˆA † i 32 Generalized Measurements ˆρ → ˆPn ˆρ ˆPn 4 Entanglement and its Applications 34 Entanglement and its Applications 2. The abiliy to perform “magic”. 3. Quantum dense coding. 4. Teleportation. 5. Dramatic speed up in quantum computing. We shall treat the ﬁrst four of these in this lecture and leave the ﬁnal one for the next and ﬁnal lecture. Let us begin with the EPR, in the form given by Bohm (1951). To this end, consider two qubits in the entangled state |Ψ−⟩AB = 1 Entangled states and non-locality 35 −1 ≤ E(a, b) ≤ 1 . (4.6) In order to arrive at Bell’s inequality we need to suspend disbelief and wonder what a theory would look like if the indeterminacy of quantum theory arose from hidden variables or, more precisely, local hidden variables which we denote by λ and take to be governed by a probability distribution P (λ). To this end we write the correlation function in the form E(a, b) = ∫ dλP (λ)A(a, λ)B(b, λ) . (4.7) Some words of explanation are in order. We say that this is a form based on a local hidden-variable theory because each measured result A and B depends only on (i) the choice of observable made at the observation site (a and b respectively) and (ii) the hidden variable λ, presumed to have been determined in the source of the particles. The measurement results do not depend on the choice of measurement made at the distant site. These considerations lead us to Bell’s inequality as follows. First we write E(a, b) − E(a, b′) = ∫ dλP (λ)[A(a, λ)B(b, λ) − A(a, λ)B(b′, λ)] = ∫ dλP (λ)A(a, λ)B(b, λ)[1 ± A(a ′, λ)B(b′] − ∫ dλP (λ)A(a, λ)B(b′, λ)[1 ± A(a ′, λ)B(b] . (4.8) In the second line we have added and subtracted the same expression. In doing so, we have assumed it is meaningful for quantities such as A(a, λ) and A(a ′, λ) to coexist. This is the realism part of local-realism; it states that properties exist even if we do not measure them. We recall that the product AB lies between −1 and +1 and hence we can obtain from this equality an inequality of the form |E(a, b) − E(a, b′)| ≤ ∫ dλP (λ)[1 ± A(a ′, λ)B(b′, λ)] + ∫ dλP (λ)[1 ± A(a ′, λ)B(b, λ)] = 2 ± [E(a ′, b′) + E(a ′, b)] , (4.9) which implies that |E(a, b) − E(a, b′)| + |E(a ′, b′) + E(a ′, b)| ≤ 2 . (4.10) This is Bell’s inequality; it states that any correlations of a local-realistic nature must satisfy this inequality. What do we ﬁnd for entangled quantum states? Consider again the EPR spin state: |Ψ−⟩AB = 1 36 Entanglement and its Applications It is straightforward to conﬁrm that for spin measurements on the two qubits prepared in this state we ﬁnd E(a, b) = ⟨a · ˆσ ⊗ a · ˆσ⟩ = −a · b . (4.12) If we put this into our Bell inequality we ﬁnd |E(a, b) − E(a, b′)| + |E(a ′, b′) + E(a ′, b)| = | − a · (b − b′)| + | − a ′ · (b + b′)| . (4.13) To ﬁnd the maximum value we simply choose a and a ′ to be parallel, respectively, to b − b′ and b + b′ and b and b′ to be mutually perpendicular, as depicted in Fig. 4.1. With this choice we ﬁnd |E(a, b) − E(a, b′)| + |E(a ′, b′) + E(a ′, b)| = 2√ Quantum “magic tricks” 37 measurement choice 1 and {ˆπA2 j } for choice 2. In an attempt to detect the eﬀect of Alice’s choice, Bob makes a measurement characterised by the probability operators {ˆπB k }. The joint probabilities for Alice’s and Bob’s measurement results are P (j, k) = ⟨Ψ|ˆπA1,A2 j ⊗ ˆπB k |Ψ⟩ , (4.15) where |Ψ⟩ is the joint state of Alice’s and Bob’s system. If Alice’s choice is to aﬀect the Bob’s observation, then we need the probabilities for Bob’s measurement results to depend on Alice’s choice of measurement. This is clearly not the case, however, as P (k) = ∑ j P (j, k) = ⟨Ψ|ˆπB k |Ψ⟩ , (4.16) where we have used the fact that our probability operators sum to the identity oper- ator: ∑ j ˆπA1,A2 j = ˆI . (4.17) The probabilities of any of Bob’s possible measurement results is independent of Alice’s choice of measurement and, indeed, are the same whether Alice performs a measure- ment at all. Nothing Alice does to her quantum system is detectable by Bob and hence no signalling is possible by quantum measurement of a distant system. The no-signalling theorem is a rigorous consequence of quantum theory and can be used, in quantum information theory, to place bounds on what is and is not possible. As a simple example, we can derive a lower bound on the probability for an incon- clusive outcome in unambiguous state-discrimination using the no-signalling condition (Barnett and Andersson 2002). 4.2 Quantum “magic tricks” The Bell inequality is only one of an impressive array of startling and testable conse- quences of entanglement (Redhead 1987, Greenberger et al 1990, Mermin 1990). Were these lectures about the mysteries of quantum theory, then we might enjoy exploring these, but our purpose is not to test entanglement and its consequences, but rather to exploit it. We shall present one example, however, of a testable consequence of entan- glement as it points to a necessary distinction between logical reasoning in quantum theory and the classical world. Hardy (1993, Goldstein 1994) presented a simple demonstration of non-locality without an inequality. This is instructive in that it provides a warning against reasoning on the basis of what might have been measured rather than what actually was observed. The following short presentation is reproduced, essentially verbatim, from Barnett (2009). Consider a pair of qubits, one held by Alice and the other by Bob, prepared in the pure state |Hardy⟩ = 1 38 Entanglement and its Applications |Hardy⟩ = √ Quantum dense coding 39 pair of maximally entangled qubits then we say that they share 1 ebit. By maximally entangled we mean pure state such that the reduced density operator for each of the component qubits is of the form ˆI/2. This means that we can identify the state only by bringing together the component qubits and that a measurement of just a single qubit is maximally uncertain. It is important to ask how we can get to a situation in which two parties share an ebit. One way, of course, is to prepare an entangled state at one site and then transport (carefully) one of the entangled qubits to the other site. We might very reasonably ask, however, if it is not possible to achieve the same result by means of classical communications, by exchanging instructions between the distant sites. That this is not possible follows directly from what we already know. Let us suppose that Alice prepares the entangled state |Ψ−⟩ = 1 40 Entanglement and its Applications By using an ebit we can, in a sense, double this rate by communicating two bits of information for every qubit sent from Alice to Bob. Let us start with a single ebit shared by Alice and Bob, prepared in the state |Ψ−⟩AB = 1 Teleportation 41 and hence that the product of the eigenvalues of ˆσx ⊗ ˆσx, ˆσy ⊗ ˆσy and ˆσz ⊗ ˆσz must be −1. This means that there can be no state of two qubits, for example, in which the x-, y- and z- components of the spin are all the same. 4.5 Teleportation Our ﬁnal application is quantum teleportation. This is an important application of entanglement and came as something of a surprise when it was ﬁrst proposed (Ben- nett et al 1993). We should be very clear before proceeding however, that quantum teleportation is not matter transportation like something out of the popular science ﬁction series Star Trek. A better understanding may be reached, I feel, by adopting the description proposed by Haroche, which is quantum teleportation is a “fax machine for quantum information”. It is the quantum information, or rather the quantum state that is transferred and not the physical system on which the qubit state is stored. Let us suppose that Alice wishes to send a qubit to Bob. She may know the state of the qubit or she may not. We have seen that quantum communications and classical communications are very diﬀerent and so should not be surprised that there is, in general, no classical way to achieve this. Alice has two ways to achieve the desired result (i) she can send the physical qubit carrying the quantum information to Bob (we might call this “qmail”), or (ii) she can teleport the quantum information to Bob using an ebit of shared entanglement (which we might call a “qfax”). Alice can teleport the qubit state |ψ⟩1 = α|0⟩1 + β|1⟩1 (4.28) by making use of an ebit of the form |Ψ−⟩AB = 1 42 Entanglement and its Applications |Ψ+⟩1A, then she knows that Bob’s qubit is in the state −α|0⟩B + β|1⟩B. She then has only to use a two-bit classical channel to tell Bob to perform unitary transformation number 3 so that: ˆU3 |0⟩B |1⟩B ⇒ −|0⟩B |1⟩B − α|0⟩B + β|1⟩B ⇒ α|0⟩B + β|1⟩B (4.31) and the teleportation is complete in that Bob’s qubit is in the same state as that in which the original qubit started, |ψ⟩1. Each of the other three possible Bell-measurement outcomes corresponds to a diﬀerent unitary transformation that Bob is required to perform. We can understand why teleportation works by recalling that a Bell measurement is one in which we compare the cartesian components of the two spins. In particular the four possible measurement results tell us that |Ψ−⟩ ⇒ σx diﬀerent, σy diﬀerent, σz diﬀerent |Ψ+⟩ ⇒ σx same, σy same, σz diﬀerent |Φ−⟩ ⇒ σx diﬀerent, σy same, σz same |Φ+⟩ ⇒ σx same, σy diﬀerent, σz same . (4.32) We know, also, that in the shared entangled state, |Ψ−⟩AB, has the three components of the spins all opposite to each other. Hence we can reason as follows: (i) If the Bell measurement gives the state |Ψ−⟩1A then the spin components for the qubits 1 and A are anti-aligned but we know also that the qubits A and B are anti-aligned and hence we are left with Bob’s qubit in initial state of qubit 1. (ii) If the Bell measurement gives the state |Ψ+⟩1A then the x- and y-components of the spins for the qubits 1 and A are the same but the z-component is diﬀerent. It follows that qubit B is left in a state in which the x- and y-components of the spin are opposite to that for the initial state of qubit 1, but the z-component is the same. Instructing Bob to perform a rotation, through π about the z-axis will leave his qubit in the initial state of qubit 1. Similarly, (iii) if the Bell measurement gives the state |Φ−⟩ then Bob needs to perform a qubit-rotation about the x-axis and (iv) a Bell measurement giving the state |Φ+⟩ means that Bob needs to perform a rotation about the y-axis. There is much more that could be said about teleportation, but we conclude this all too brief introduction by describing a few features worthy of further thought: 1. We note that there is a sense in which Bob already has the information after Alice’s measurement. This is a direct consequence of the projective nature of Alice’s Bell measurement. What saves us from violating the no-signalling theorem is simply that Bob does not know where to look for it. 2. Alice’s copy of the original qubit is destroyed in the teleportation process. This is inevitable and not simply a consequence of the scheme we have adopted. Were it otherwise, then we would be violating the no-cloning theorem. 3. Alice does not have to know the state that is to be teleported. We have chosen a general qubit state parametrized by the amplitudes α and β, but no process undertaken Teleportation 43 by either Alice or Bob is dependent on these amplitudes and it follows that Alice does not need to know the state to be teleported. 4. The qubit to be teleported may itself be part of an entangled state and in this way we can teleport entanglement. In this way, if Alice shares an ebit with Bob and also one with Claire then she can teleport the entanglement to leave Bob and Claire sharing an ebit: |Ψ−⟩C1 ⊗ |Ψ−⟩AB ⇒ |Ψ−⟩CB . (4.33) This process of transferring entanglement by teleportation is commonly referred to as entanglement-swapping. 5 Quantum Computation Quantum gates 45 a Boolean operation) on a string of bits.

We are not completely free in the operations we can devise, however, as we must respect the laws of quantum mechanics. This means, in particular, that the transformations we can perform are necessarily limited to the unitary transformations. Even at the single qubit level, however, there is already a great deal more we can do that for a classical bit, as we are allowed to generate superpositions of the two qubit states |0⟩ and |1⟩. A single qubit-gate may perform any single-qubit unitary 46 Quantum Computation transformation, that is any rotation on the Bloch sphere. Six of the more commonly occurring one-qubit gates, together with the unitary transformations they enact are presented in Fig 5.3.

Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). We require in addition gates that couple qubits. Unlike their classical counterparts, these gates have two output qubits as well as two input ones; where this not the case then we would not respect unitarity. Principal among the vast array of possible two- bit gates is the controlled NOT gate, or CNOT gate, depicted in Fig 5.4. The two qubits entering the gate are designated the control qubit, C and the target qubit, T. The gate enacts the transformation |1⟩ → |0⟩, |0⟩ → |1⟩ if the control qubit is in the state |1⟩ but leaves it unchanged if the if the control qubit is in the state |0⟩. Despite its innocuous looking truth table, it is straightforward to show that this gate is intrinsically quantum-mechanical in nature. To see this, let the control bit entering the gate be in a superposition of computational basis states. The transformation is then 1 Quantum gates 47 the possibility of non-locality) suﬃces to establish the intrinsically quantum nature of the CNOT gate.

Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). In digital electronics, a small number of gates suﬃces to allow all possible Boolean operations and, remarkably, something very similar holds for quantum gates. We can perform any unitary evolution of a set of qubits by acting on them only with single- qubit gates and a suitable two-qubit gate; the CNOT gate suﬃces for this purpose. We do not prove this assertion here as the required demonstration would take too long and occupy too much space. The proof is not particularly diﬃcult, however, and may be ﬁnd in the (Nielsen and Chuang 2000, Barnett 2009). As an example we can construct the three-qubit Toﬀoli gate, or controlled, controlled NOT gate using single- qubit and two-bit gates. The operation of the Toﬀoli gate is most readily understood in the computational basis, |0⟩, |1⟩ for the three qubits: |A⟩ ⊗ |B⟩ ⊗ |C⟩ → |A⟩ ⊗ |B⟩ ⊗ |C ⊕ (A · B)⟩ , (5.2) where A, B, and C take the values 0 or 1. In words, the gate leaves the computational- basis of the ﬁrst and second qubits unchanged but ﬂips the state, |0⟩ ↔ |1⟩, of the third qubit if both the ﬁrst and second qubits are in the state |1⟩. The Toﬀoli gate and its implementation in terms of two-qubit gates is given in Fig 5.5. This involves two CNOT gates and three controlled unitary gates, in which the designated unitary transformation, ˆW = 1 − i 48 Quantum Computation = W W W A> B> C> Fig. 5.5 The three-qubit Toﬀoli gate constructed from two-qubit gates. Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). If we can combine enough qubits and produce enough gates then we can produce any desired unitary transformation. This would then constitute a quantum processor, designed to take input data in the form of an input multi-qubit state and generate output in the form of another state. The information could then be extracted by means of a measurement on the qubits. What is necessary in order to achieve this goal? The answer was provided by DiVincenzo (1996) in the form of ﬁve critteria for implementing a quantum computer. These have been modiﬁed somewhat over the intervening period, but the original ﬁve serve to convey the key requirements: 1) We need well-deﬁned extendible qubit array that is stable. 2) The qubit array should be preparable in a suitable starting state, such as that in which all the qubits are in the state |0⟩. 3) We need good isolation from the environment, i.e. long coherence times. 4) It must be possible to perform a universal set of gate operations, such as single-qubit rotations and CNOT operations for any chosen pair of qubits. 5) Finally, we need to be able to perform something close to ideal von Neumann measurements on each of the qubits. These demands present a signiﬁcant technical challenge and, although great advances have been made, I think it safe to say that, at present, not proposed implementation of a quantum processor has managed to achieve them all. We should note that the gate model of a quantum processor, described above, is not the only possible one. An alternative is provided by the use of cluster states (Raussendorf et al 2003). In this approach we ﬁrst prepare a highly entangled state of our qubits and then proceed by performing a sequence of single-qubit measurements followed by single-qubit unitary transformations the form of which depends on the preceding measurement results. 5.3 Principles of quantum computation The basic idea of a quantum computation is quite simple. We start with an input string of bits, which we encode onto the initial states of our by preparing each in one of the states |0⟩ or |1⟩. We then use our collection of gates to perform on this state a Principles of quantum computation 49 unitary transformation: 101101001 → |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ → ˆU |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ . (5.4) The computation is completed by measuring each qubit to give back a (classical) bit string which, hopefully, is the desired output: ˆU |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ → 000111010 . (5.5) This is not quite all there is to it. There is a problem if the function we wish to calculate gives the same value for two distinct inputs. Consider, for example, the two-bit transformation in two bits, A and B, are transformed into A and (A AND B): 00 → 00 01 → 00 10 → 10 11 → 11 . (5.6) The diﬃculty in realising this computation on a quantum processor in the manner indicated above is that the transformation must be unitary and that unitary transfor- mation maintain the overlap of the initial states and our computation requires |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ → |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ → |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⟨0, 0|0, 1⟩ = 0 −→ ⟨0, 0|0, 0⟩ = 1 , (5.7) which clearly violates this requirement. In order to be able to compute any function, we input into our quantum processor not one string of qubits but two. Let the input states of the two strings be |a⟩ and |b⟩. The ﬁrst of these is the input data, with the sequence of bits encoded onto the qubits as in Eq (5.4). The second string is to act as our output and is often prepared in the state |b⟩ = |0⟩ ⊗N , so that every qubit is in the state |0⟩. If the processor is to calculate the Boolean function f (a) then we require it to realise the transformation |a⟩ ⊗ |b⟩ → |a⟩ ⊗ |b ⊕ f (a)⟩ , (5.8) where ⊕ denotes the bit-wise modulo addition. (See in Fig 5.6.) It is straightforward to u ^ f >a >a >b >b + f(a) Fig. 5.6 A quantum processor designed to compute the function f (a).

(5.9) Of course this is not the only unitary operator that performs this task, but this simple operator suﬃces to demonstrate that a suitable unitary operator exists. The remarkable properties of a quantum computer derive largely from the fact that we can put into the processor not just a single number but rather a superposition of many. If each qubit in the ﬁrst qubit string is prepared in the state 2−1/2(|0⟩ + |1⟩) then the string of N qubits is in a superposition of every number between 0 and 2N −1: 2−N/2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩) ⊗N = 2−N/2 2 N −1∑ a=0 |a⟩ . (5.10) The linearity of quantum mechanics means that the output state is an entangled one in which the function f (a) has been calculated for every possible input number, as in Fig 5.7. >a >b Σ a >a >b + f(a)Σ a xu ^ f } Fig. 5.7 If a superposition of possible input numbers is prepared then the output state is an entangled one in which values of the function for each of the inputs appear. Reproduced, with permission, from Barnett(2009). A simple example may serve to illustrate the potential of a quantum processor. With this aim in mind we present Deutsch’s algorithm and its many-bit extension, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (Deutsch 1985, Deutsch and Jozsa 1992, Cleve et al 1998). Although somewhat contrived in nature, these serve to illustrate in a very simple way the potential for speed-up oﬀered by a quantum computer. These are examples of a class of challenges called oracle-problems. We start with Deutsch’s algorithm (Deutsch 1985). Let us suppose that we have a ‘black box’ (an oracle) and that this device evaluates a one-bit function of a one-bit input. This means that we input a single bit, with value either 0 or 1, and that this generates an output value of either 0 or 1. There are four possible such functions, two constant functions: f (0) = 0 f (1) = 0 , and f (0) = 1 f (1) = 1 , (5.11) and two balanced functions (balanced in the sense that both possible bit values occur in the output, one for each input): f (0) = 0 f (1) = 1 , Principles of quantum computation 51 and f (0) = 1 f (1) = 0 . (5.12) If we want to know which function the oracle calculates then we need to input both bits values and examine the corresponding outputs. Let us suppose, however, that our task is simply to determine whether the function calculated is a constant function or a balanced one. Classically, of course, this requires us to input both possible bit values and so also requires two computations. A suitable quantum processor, however, can do this in a single step. Consider the general transformation given in Eq. (5.8), but with the two subit strings each replaced by a single qubit so that the transformation enacted by the processor is |A⟩ ⊗ |B⟩ → |A⟩ ⊗ |B ⊕ f (A)⟩ . (5.13) We can make use of the superposition principle to prepare both of our qubits in a superposition state and so produce the transformation 1 52 Quantum Computation the qubit-string will be in a state orthogonal to this. Hence only a single computation is required to determine whether the function is constant or balanced. This represents an improvement over the classical requirement of 2(n−1) + 1 that is exponential in n, the number of bits. Such dramatic improvements are characteristic of a number of quantum algorithms, but not all. 5.4 Quantum algorithms Let us suppose that we have a suitable quantum processor, what might we do with it? One important thing that we might do is to use it to simulate a complicated quantum process (Feynman 1982). As quantum systems get larger it becomes ever more diﬃcult to simulate them; were this not the case, then we could emulate a large quantum com- puter on a classical one. We might also use a quantum computer to speed-up searching in an unstructured database using Grover’s algorithm, which provides a dramatic im- provement (albeit not an exponential one) over classical methods (Grover 1998). The most dramatic possibility to date, however, is Shor’s algorithm for determining the two prime factors of a large number. You will recall that it is the diﬃculty in perform- ing this task that underlies to security of the RSA public-key cryptosystem and with it, much of the world’s secure communications (Shor 1997). It was Shor’s proposal more than any other single factor that truly changed quantum computation, and with it quantum information, from a small-scale research ﬁeld into a major international endeavour. There is space, in these lectures, to present brieﬂy only one quantum al- gorithm and, because of its signiﬁcance, we choose Shor’s algorithm. Several others, including Grover’s algorithm, and a more complete presentation of Shor’s algorithm may be found in (Barnett 2009). At the heart of Shor’s algorithm is the remarkable ability of a quantum computer to perform, highly eﬃciently, a quantum Fourier transform and hence to ﬁnd the period of a function. To see why this helps in factoring, we need to consider an idea from number theory. We start with three bits of input data: N , the number to be factorized, m, a small integer chosen at random and the non-negative integers, n = 0, 1, 2, · · ·. We ﬁrst make the series FN (n) = mnmodN . If we can then ﬁnd the period of this function, r, such that FN (n + r) = FN (n), then the greatest common divisor of mr/2 ± 1 and N divides N . In other words, one of the factors of each of mr/2 ± 1 is also a prime factor of N . There are, of course, some additional subtleties, but the number theory to prove this is by no means diﬃcult, and may be found in Barnett (2009). Let us consider two examples to demonstrate the idea. Let us consider the problem of factoring 15 by means of this process. Let us ﬁrst select m = 2, so that our series is 20mod15 = 1 21mod15 = 2 22mod15 = 4 23mod15 = 8 24mod15 = 1 . . . (5.16) We see that the period is 4 and hence Quantum algorithms 53 mr/2 + 1 = 5 mr/2 − 1 = 3 (5.17) and these are the required prime factors. Let us try another example, m = 11, for which our series is 110mod15 = 1 111mod15 = 11 112mod15 = 1 . . , (5.18) so the period is 2. This gives mr/2 + 1 = 12 mr/2 − 1 = 10 . (5.19) The greatest common divisor of 12 and 15 is 3, which is one of the prime factors we seek and the creates common divisor of 10 and 15 is 5, which is the other factor. So why do we need a quantum computer to run this seemingly simple algorithm? The answer is that each step can be run eﬃciently, even for very large numbers, on a classical computer with the single exception of ﬁnding the period of the function FN (n). This is a very diﬃcult task and it is no exaggeration to state that it is this period ﬁnding problem that underlies the security of the RSA cryptosysem. Central to Shor’s algorithm for factoring on a quantum computer is the quantum Fourier transform (Nielsen and Chuang 2000, Mermin 2007, Barnett 2009). We do not attempt a detailed account of the quantum Fourier transform, but present instead only an outline of the steps involved in Shor’s algorithm. It is, perhaps, clearest to give a list of the ﬁve major steps: Shor’s algorithm to ﬁnd the two prime factors of N 1. We start by ﬁnding two integers, q and M , such that q = 2M > N 2 (5.20) and prepare two registers, each containing M qubits. 2. We set each on the qubits in the ﬁrst register to the state 2−1/2(|0⟩+|1⟩) and each in the second register in the state |0⟩, so that the state input into our quantum processor is |ψ⟩ = 1 54 Quantum Computation |1⟩ = |00 · · · 001⟩ |2⟩ = |00 · · · 010⟩ |3⟩ = |00 · · · 011⟩ . . . (5.22) 3. Next we chose an integer m at random and use the quantum processor to entangle the two registers so that |ψ⟩ → 1 Errors and decoherence 55 5.5 Errors and decoherence So what stops us building a quantum processor, revolutionising computation and breaking into RSA? The short answer is that we don’t yet have any suitably scal- able implementation of quantum logic elements such as qubits and gates. Many technical challenges remain to be solved before we can build a quantum computer to challenge current devices based on classical logic. I mention here only one problem, that of decoherence. In a quantum computer our information is encoded onto two-state quantum systems, our qubits and these are made to interact with each other by the implementation of desired Hamiltonians. Yet the quantum natures, both of the qubits and of the Hamiltonian, makes them extremely sensitive to their environment and even weak interactions can have a disastrous eﬀect. As an illustration, let us consider the eﬀect of a single-qubit error in an implementation of Deutsch’s algorithm. To keep things simple, let us consider only a phase error: |0⟩ → |0⟩ |1⟩ → −|1⟩ , (5.28) and a bit-ﬂip error |0⟩ → |1⟩ |1⟩ → |0⟩ . (5.29) Recall that we obtain the desired information, as to whether the computed function is constant or balanced, by measuring the ﬁrst qubit to be in the state 2−1/2(|0⟩ + |1⟩) or 2−1/2(|0⟩ − |1⟩), respectively. If a bit-ﬂip error occurs for this qubit then we are safe, but if a phase-error occurs then we get the wrong answer! Clearly we need to work hard to suppress all sources of errors and decoherence, but this is not the end of the problem. For large-scale computations we need a large number of qubits and the scaling is not at all favourable. To see this let us suppose that the probability that a single qubit has no error in a time t is exp (−Γt) . If we have n qubits then the probability that none of these experiences an error in this time is exp (−nΓt) , which is exponential in n. But worse is to come. Let us suppose that t is the typical amount of time it takes to perform a single gate operation. If we need a sequence of m of these then we ﬁnd exp (−nmΓt) . Typically we might need each qubit to interact with every other qubit so m may be of the same rode as n. We do not need to perform the gate operations one at a time, of course, and by suitably optimising the order of operations, we might have m ≈ log n to give a ﬁnal zero-error probability of exp (−n log nΓt) . (5.30) For 300 qubits, the exponent is about 2,000 times smaller than the single-qubit and single-gate error rate, e−Γt, that we started with. The zero-error probability is the 2, 000th power of the no error probability for a single qubit and a single-gate operation. 56 Quantum Computation Clearly we need to control sources of decoherence to an extraordinary degree but ultimately this will always be a losing battle. Is it all hopeless? By no means; the solution is essentially the same as we encountered in the ﬁrst lecture. We can combat errors in a quantum computer by redundancy, just as we do to combat classical errors. This is a more subtle problem than in the classical regime, however. Firstly there is the no-cloning theorem which tells us that we cannot literally make multiple copies of our qubits and there is also the problem that quantum measurements, if not performed carefully, will modify the very qubit states that we are trying to protect. Nevertheless, there are protocols detecting and correcting qubit errors. Perhaps the most important of these is the Steane code, in which each logical qubit is ended onto seven logical qubits (Steane 1996, Barnett 2009), but a description of how this works will have to wait for next time.
