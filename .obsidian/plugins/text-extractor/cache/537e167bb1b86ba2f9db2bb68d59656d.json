{"path":"Books and Papers/Quantum Mechanics & Information/Classical Field Theory.pdf","text":"Ma432 Classical Field Theory Notes by Chris Blair These notes cover a lot of the 2008-2009 Ma432 Classical Field Theory course given by Dr Nigel Buttimore (replaced by Ma3431 Classical Field Theory and Ma3432 Classical Electrodynamics, the former corresponding to at least the ﬁrst four sections of these notes). The emphasis is mostly on the Lagrangian formulation of classical electrodynamics and the solution of Maxwell’s equations by Green’s function methods. They are probably slightly suspect, particularly with regard to indices and brackets (and no doubt contain other more unsettling errors). I am told that Dr Buttimore has changed his units from those in these notes, so use at your own discretion.

Loosely speaking, a ﬁeld in a physics is a physical quantity deﬁned at every point of space and time, which can be valued as a single number (scalar ﬁeld), a vector (vector ﬁeld, such as electromagnetism and gravity), or as a tensor. We will restrict ourselves to the study of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and do so in a uniﬁed manner consistent with special relativity. The methods we use are based in the La- grangian approach to classical mechanics. Recall that in classical mechanics the Lagrangian L was deﬁned as L = T − V where T and V are the kinetic and potential energies of the system in question. The action of the system was deﬁned to be the quantity S = ∫ Ldt, and the equations of motion of the system were found from the principle of least action, which states that the true time evolution of the system is such that the action is an extremum. The equations of motion (known as the Euler-Lagrange equations) were thus derived from the condition δS = δ ∫ Ldt = 0. In studying ﬁelds which take on diﬀerent values at diﬀerent space points it is convenient to express the Lagrangian itself as an integral, L = ∫ d3x L, where L is called the Lagrangian density. The full action is then S = ∫ dtd 3x L. Note that when we approach this from the special relativistic point of view the separate time and space components will be uniﬁed into a single package. 1.2 Field theory as a continuum limit To begin, let us show how a simple ﬁeld theory may be derived by taking the contin- uum limit of a system of N particles on a spring with spring constant k. Let the particles have equilibrium positions a, 2a, . . . N a and denote the deviation of the i th particle from its equilibrium by φi. The force on the ith particle is Fi = { +k(φ2 − φ1) i = 1 −k(φi − φi−1) + k(φi+1 − φi) 1 < i < N −k(φN − φN −1) i = N The Lagrangian is L = T − V = N∑ i=1 1 2m ˙φ 2 i − N∑ i=1 1 2 k(φi+1 − φi) 2 and the equations of motion are m ¨φi = −k(φi − φi−1) + k(φi−1 − φi) 1 < i < N We now take the limit a → 0 while keeping (N − 1)a ﬁxed by letting N → ∞. If we write x = ai as the position of the i th particle then we can regard φi ≡ φ(x = ai, t), and using the 3 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 1: Simple ﬁeld theory equations of motion in the form m a ¨φi = ka 1 a2 [(φi−1 − φi) − (φi − φi−1) ] we can apply the deﬁnition of the derivative ∂φ ∂x ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣i = lim a→0 φ ([i + 1]a) − φ(ai) a twice to obtain the equations of motion in the limit a → 0: µ∂2φ ∂t = κ∂2φ ∂x2 where κ = lima→0 ka and µ = m a is the mass density which we keep ﬁxed. We see that our simple ﬁeld obeys the wave equation. If we deﬁne L = N∑ i=1 aLi Li = 1 2µ ˙φ 2 i − 1 2 k a (φi+1 − φi)2 then in the limit we obtain the Lagrangian density L = 1 2 µ ( ∂φ ∂t )2 − 1 2κ ( ∂φ ∂x )2 such that L = ∫ dxL. 1.3 Euler-Lagrange equations A more general Lagrangian density would be of the form L(∂tφi, ∂xφi, φi, t, x). We can use Hamilton’s Principle of Least Action to ﬁnd the general form of the equations of motion. Let us consider the simplest case where the ﬁeld is one-dimensional and the Lagrangian density is invariant under time and space translation. Then we have that ∫ δL dx dt = 0 and in full ∫ ( ∂L ∂(∂tφ)δ(∂tφ) + ∂L ∂(∂xφ)δ(∂xφ) + ∂L ∂φ δφ ) dx dt = 0 Noting that δ(∂tφ) = ∂t(δφ) and δ(∂tφ) = ∂t(δφ) we rewrite this as ∫ ( d dt ( ∂L ∂(∂tφ)δφ) − ∂t ∂L ∂(∂tφ)δφ + d dx ( ∂L ∂(∂xφ)δφ ) − ∂x ∂L ∂(∂xφ)δφ + ∂L ∂φ δφ) dx dt = 0 4 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 1: Simple ﬁeld theory We integrate out the total time and space derivatives and use the fact that the δφ term must vanish at the endpoints to then obtain δS = ∫ (∂t ∂L ∂(∂tφ) + ∂x ∂L ∂(∂xφ) − ∂L ∂φ ) δφ dx dt = 0 hence we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations for this ﬁeld: ∂t ∂L ∂(∂tφ) + ∂x ∂L ∂(∂xφ) − ∂L ∂φ = 0 For a vector ﬁeld just replace φ by A i. 5 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 2: Special relativity 2 Special relativity We will now introduce the machinery that allows us to express ﬁeld theory in a manner consistent with the theory of special relativity. In particular, we seek to formulate the theory of ﬁelds in a manner that is Lorentz covariant - that is, related from one frame to another via Lorentz transformations. Note that we do not introduce special relativity systematically but assume some prior knowledge of the subject. For completeness we note that the two postulates of special relativity are that the laws of physics take the same form in all inertial (non-accelerating) reference frames, and that the speed of light c in vacuum is an absolute constant regardless of frame. 2.1 Rapidity The basic Lorentz transformations in 1 + 1 dimensions are t ′ = γ (t − vx c2 ) x′ = γ(x − vt) where γ = 1 √1 − v2 c2 for a frame S′ moving with velocity v with respect to the frame S. We have that ct ′ − x′ = √ 1 + v c 1 − v c (ct − x) We deﬁne the rapidity ζ(v) as ζ(v) = 1 2 ln ( 1 + v c 1 − v c ) so that ct ′ − x′ = e ζ(ct − x) Note that rapidities add. We can then show that v = tanh ζ γ = cosh ζ which allows us to write the Lorentz transformations as ct ′ = ct cosh ζ − x sinh ζ x ′ = x cosh ζ − ct sinh ζ In the full 1 + 3 dimensions we can write this transformation in matrix form as Λ =     cosh ζ − sinh ζ 0 0 − sinh ζ cosh ζ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1     6 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 2: Special relativity called a boost in the x-direction. Note that the most general proper Lorentz transformation can be written as a product of a 3-rotation to align the new x-axis with the direction of motion, a boost along the new x-direction with velocity v and a second 3-space rotation. 2.2 Tensor notation A basic invariant in special relativity is the interval ds separating two (inﬁnitesimally close) events in four-dimensional space-time: ds 2 = c2dt 2 − dx2 1 − dx2 2 − dx2 3. From this we get the metric tensor: gµν = diag (1, −1, −1, −1) = gµν which is used to raise and lower indices as follows: xµ = gµαxα xµ = gµαxα Note that we sum over repeated indices. Upper indices are said to be contravariant, and lower indices are said to be covariant. Note that (in this metric) raising a time-index has no eﬀect, x0 = x0, while raising a space-index changes the sign, xi = −xi. Note also that indices with Greek letters can take any value in {0, 1, 2, 3} while indices with Roman letters refer to spatial indices, {1, 2, 3}. Thus in our notation we have xµ = (ct, ⃗x) and xi = ⃗x. A Lorentz transformation relates events x′ in the frame S′ to events x in the frame S, and is written as x′ µ = Λ µ βxβ The metric tensor is invariant under Lorentz transformations gαβ = gµνΛµ αΛν β A four-dimensional vector, or four-vector, is written as A µ and transforms like the coordinates xµ: A′µ = Λ µ νA ν while a second rank tensor T µν transforms like the product of (components of) two four- vectors: T ′µν = Λ µ αΛν βT αβ and similarly for tensors of higher rank. We form the four-dimensional Kronecker delta by lowering the index of gµν: gλνgνµ = gµ λ = δµ λ = diag (1, 1, 1, 1) We also have the four-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol, ϵ αβγδ which is +1 for even permu- tations of αβγδ and −1 for odd permutations, with ϵ 0123 = 1. Note that for the covariant form, ϵαβγδ, we have ϵ0123 = −1. Both the Levi-Civita symbol and the Kronecker delta are invariant under Lorentz transformations. 7 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 2: Special relativity We can form a scalar invariant under Lorentz transformations (a Lorentz scalar) by con- tracting two four vectors aµbµ = a′µb′ µ The invariant time element dτ is given by c2dτ 2 = dxµdxµ It is related to the usual time element by dτ = dt γ ⇒ d dτ = γ d dt This allows us to deﬁne vectors of four-velocity V µ = dxµ dτ and four-momentum pµ = m dxµ dτ where m is the rest mass of the particle. The zero component of the four-momentum is related to the energy E = γmc2 by cp0 = E, so we can write the four-momentum as pµ = ( E c , ⃗p) . Note that the contraction of the four-momentum with itself is pµpµ = m 2c2. If this (or indeed the scalar formed by contracting any four-vector with itself) is equal to zero we say that the four-vector is light-like, if it is greater than zero we say that it is space-like, if it is less than zero it is timelike. This can be related to the idea of light-cones: ct x v < c v > c v = c Past Future This picture can be understood as follows: events that occur inside the lightcone are timelike; it is possible to ﬁnd a Lorentz transformation such that any two events occur at the same point in space, but at diﬀerent times. Similarly, events that occur outside the lightcone are spacelike in that is possible to ﬁnd a Lorentz transformation to a frame such that any two events occur at the same point in time, but are separated in space. 8 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 2: Special relativity The boundary of the light-cone is given by a line corresponding to the motion of a particle of velocity c. The motion of a particle with velocity less than c lies within its light-cone. Events that occur within the past light-cone of a particle can aﬀect the particle in the present, while events that occur outside it cannot. Finally we must consider calculus in space-time. We will be integrating over the four- dimensional volume element d4x = dx0dx1dx2dx3 = c dt dx1dx2dx3 which is an invariant. Derivatives are denoted by ∂µ ≡ ∂ ∂xµ ∂µ ≡ ∂ ∂xµ Note that diﬀerentiating with respect to a lower index gives an upper index, while diﬀeren- tiating with respect to an upper index gives a lower index, so for instance ∂xµ ∂xν = δν µ ∂xµ ∂xν = gµρ ∂xρ ∂xν = gµρδν ρ = gµν ∂(∂αxβ) ∂(∂µxν) = δµ αδν β 9 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 3: Covariant ﬁeld theory 3 Covariant ﬁeld theory We now seek to formulate ﬁeld theories in a special relativistic context. We will be seeking actions S = ∫ L d3x dt = ∫ L dt = ∫ Lγ dτ which are relativistically invariant. Recall that the ﬁrst postulate of special relativity is that the laws of physics are the same in all (inertial) reference frames - these laws take the form of the equations of motion derived from the condition δS = 0, hence S must be Lorentz invariant. As dτ is an invariant scalar we see that we must have Lγ also a Lorentz scalar. The simplest way to achieve this is to contract the available four-vectors. Note that the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for a ﬁeld A µ are ∂µ ( ∂L ∂(∂µAν) ) − ∂L ∂Aν = 0 3.1 Relativistic free particle action For a free particle, the only scalar which preserves translational invariance is pµpµ = (mc) 2, suggesting a Lagrangian of the form L = Cpµpµ = Cm 2c2, where C is some constant. Let us look at the non-relativistic limit of this Lagrangian. We have S = ∫ L dt = ∫ Lγ dτ We want the non-relativistic limit of L to agree with the Lagrangian for a non-relativistic free particle, L = 1 2m⃗v2. Consider the Taylor expansion of mγ−1: mγ−1 = m (1 − ⃗v2 c2 ) = m − m 2 ⃗v2 c2 + O ( 1 c4 ) ⇒ −mc 2γ−1 = −mc2 + 1 2 m⃗v2 As the constant term −mc 2 is unimportant, we see that we can take our Lagrangian to be L = −mc 2 γ hence we have action S = −mc 2 ∫ dt γ = −mc 2 ∫ dτ or S = − 1 m ∫ pµpµdτ 10 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 3: Covariant ﬁeld theory 3.2 Relativistic interactions We now let our particle be acted on by some ﬁeld with potential Aµ(xν). Possible scalars include Aµpµ and AµAµ. Again we want to choose the Lagrangian so that the non-relativistic limit gives us the interaction Lagrangian for a particle in the presence of an electric ﬁeld (in the non-relativistic limit the particle’s velocity goes to zero, and so it will not interact with the magnetic ﬁeld). This is L = −eΦ. This suggests we look at eAµpµ = ep0A0 − e⃗v · ⃗A. Now, p0 = E c = mγc, and we identify A 0 with Φ. Then in the limit ⃗v → 0 we have epµA µ = mcγeΦ. Thus we take our interaction term to be Lint = − e mcγ Aµpµ The total action is now S = − 1 m ∫ (pµ + e c Aµ) pµdτ = − ∫ (pµ + e c Aµ) dxµ using pµ = m dxµ dτ . The dynamics of the system can then be found by varying this action. First, let us note that δ(pµpµ) = δpµpµ + pµδpµ = pµδpµ + pµδpµ = 2pµδpµ = 2mdxµ dτ δpµ but also δ(pµpµ) = δ(m2c2) = 0 and hence if m ̸= 0 we have dxµ dτ δpµ = 0 ⇒ dxµδpµ = 0 Now let us compute the variation: δS = −δ ∫ ( pµ + e c Aµ) dxµ = − ∫ (pµ + e c Aµ) δ(dxµ) − ∫ (δpµ + e c δAµ) dxµ = − ∫ (pµ + e c Aµ) d(δxµ) − e c ∫ ∂Aµ ∂xν δxνdxµ where we have used the above result to eliminate the δpµ term. We now use ∫ (pµ + e c Aµ) d(δxµ) = ∫ d (pµ + e c Aµ(δxµ)) − ∫ d (pµ + e c Aµ) δxµ = ∫ d dτ (pµ + e c Aµ(δxµ)) dτ − ∫ d (pµ + e c Aµ) δxµ 11 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 3: Covariant ﬁeld theory and the fact that the variation δxµ vanishes at the end points to obtain δS = − [(pµ + e c Aµ) δx µ]τ2 τ1︸ ︷︷ ︸ =0 + ∫ (dpµ + e c dAµ) δxµ − e c ∫ ∂Aµ ∂xν δxνdx µ = ∫ (dpµ + e c ∂Aµ ∂xν dxν) δxµ − e c ∫ ∂Aµ ∂xν δxνdx µ = ∫ [ dpµ dτ dτ + e c ( ∂Aµ ∂xν dx ν dτ δxµ − ∂Aµ ∂xν dx µ dτ δxν) dτ ] Switching the dummy variables µ and ν in the second Aµ term we have: δS = ∫ dτ δxµ [dpµ dτ + e c ( ∂Aµ ∂xν dx ν dτ − ∂Aν ∂xµ dxν dτ )] = 0 Hence we ﬁnd equations of motion dpµ dτ = e c ( ∂Aν ∂xµ − ∂Aµ ∂xν ) dxν dτ 3.3 Electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor The electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be expressed in terms of the 4-potential Aµ as ⃗E = −1 c ∂t ⃗A − ⃗∇Φ (A0 ≡ Φ) ⃗B = ⃗∇ × ⃗A Note in passing that ⃗E has odd parity (i.e. transforms as ⃗E ↦→ − ⃗E under space reversal, ⃗r ↦→ −⃗r) and is even under time reversal, while ⃗B has even parity and is odd under time reversal. We now introduce the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ where we identify F i0 = Ei F ij = −εijkBk as we have Ei = −∂0A i − ∂iA0 = −∂0A i + ∂iA0 = F i0 −εijkBk = −εijkεklm∂lAm = −(δi l δj m − δi mδj l )∂lAm = −∂iA j + ∂jA i = ∂iA j − ∂jAi = F ij 12 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 3: Covariant ﬁeld theory Explicitly, the contravariant and covariant forms of the tensor are: F µν =     0 −E1 −E2 −E3 E1 0 −B3 B2 E2 B3 0 −B1 E3 −B2 B1 0     Fµν =     0 E1 E2 E3 −E1 0 −B3 B2 −E2 B3 0 −B1 −E3 −B2 B1 0     The equations of motion derived in the last section can then be written dpµ dτ = e c Fµν dxν dτ To write these in three-dimensional form we ﬁrst set µ = 0 and sum over ν (noting that d dτ = γ d dt ) dp0 dt = e c F0i dxi dt = e c F i0vi ⇒ dE dt = e ⃗E · ⃗v using p0 = E c and the fact that raising a spatial index changes the sign, as well as the antisymmetry of Fµν. For µ = i dpi dt = e c Fi0 dx0 dt + e c Fij dxj dt ⇒ −dpi dt = −eF i0 − e c εijkvkBk ⇒ d⃗p dt = e ⃗E + e c⃗v × ⃗B Note that Fµν is invariant under an important class of transformations known as gauge transformations. A gauge transformation of the electromagnetic four-potential is a trans- formation of the form Aµ ↦→ Aµ + ∂µφ for some scalar ﬁeld φ, and under this we have Fµν ↦→ ∂µAν − ∂νAµ + ∂µ∂νφ − ∂ν∂µφ = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ = Fµν The invariance of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor and hence the observable ﬁelds allows us to simplify problems by choosing a particular gauge, i.e. a particular choice of the Aµ satisfying certain conditions. For example we will later explicitly solve Maxwell’s equations (introduced in the next section) in Lorenz gauge: ∂µA µ = 0. 3.4 Maxwell’s equations In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, they threw no shadow on the ﬂoor. Bram Stoker, Dracula The simplest choice of a Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor is L = CFµνF µν where C is some constant. We will now ﬁnd the equations of motion satisﬁed by 13 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 3: Covariant ﬁeld theory the ﬁeld using the Euler-Lagrange equations. We have ∂(FαβF αβ) ∂(∂µAν) = 2F αβ ∂Fαβ ∂(∂µAν) = 2F αβ (∂(∂αAβ) ∂(∂µAν) − ∂(∂βAα) ∂(∂µAν) ) = 2F αβ ( δµ αδν β − δµ β δν α) = 2F µν − 2F νµ = 4F µν and as ∂L ∂Aν = 0 we have the equation of motion for a free ﬁeld ∂µF µν = 0 If we introduce a source of charge and 3-current J µ = (cρ, ⃗J) (see the next section) then we have an interaction term Lint = −1 c AµJ µ and we obtain ∂µF µν = − 1 4CcJ ν and choosing C = − 1 16π (i.e. Gaussian cgs units) gives ∂µF µν = 4π c J ν In three dimensions this becomes ⃗∇ · ⃗E = 4πρ and −1 c ∂ ∂t ⃗E + ⃗∇ × ⃗B = 4π c ⃗J These are two of Maxwell’s equations. The other two may be expressed using the dual tensor ˜F µν deﬁned by ˜F µν = 1 2 ϵ µνρσFσρ = ϵ µνρσ∂ρAσ The components of the dual tensor may be seen to be ˜F i0 = Bi ˜F ij = ϵ ijkEk in words, replace ⃗E with ⃗B and ⃗B with − ⃗E. Now consider ∂µ ˜F µν = ϵ µνρσ∂µ∂ρAσ 14 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 3: Covariant ﬁeld theory This is the contraction of an antisymmetric tensor with a symmetric tensor, and so is equal to zero. Hence we have the equation ∂µ ˜F µν = 0 By comparing with the above Maxwell’s equations in the case that J µ = 0 and interchang- ing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the manner mentioned above, we ﬁnd the other two Maxwell’s equations: ⃗∇ · ⃗B = 0 and 1 c ∂ ∂t ⃗B + ⃗∇ × ⃗E = 0 Note that the equation ∂µ ˜F µν = 0 can also be written in the form ∂λFµν + ∂µFνλ + ∂νFλµ = 0 The various contractions arising from the ﬁeld tensor and its dual are FµνF µν = 2 ( ⃗B · ⃗B − ⃗E · ⃗E) Fµν ˜F µν = −4 ⃗E · ⃗B ˜Fµν ˜F µν = 2( ⃗E · ⃗E − ⃗B · ⃗B) 3.5 Four-current and charge conservation The four-current density is given by J µ(t, ⃗x) = e dxµ dt δ3(⃗x − ⃗xe(t)) where ⃗xe(t) is the path of a particle of charge e generating the ﬁeld Aµ. The charge q and current e⃗v are then given by q = ∫ ρ(t, ⃗x)d3x e⃗v = ∫ ⃗J(t, ⃗x)d3x Consider the gauge transformation Aµ → A ′ µ = Aµ + ∂µφ. This gives an interaction action S′ = − 1 c2 ∫ (J µAµ + J µ∂µφ) d4x We vary this with respect to φ: δS′ = − 1 c2 ∫ δ(J µ∂µφ)d4x = − 1 c2 ∫ (−∂µJ µδφ + ∂µ[J µδφ]) d4x The second term vanishes on the boundary, and we are left with δS′ = 1 c2 ∫ ∂µJ µδφd4x = 0 ⇒ ∂µJ µ = 0 15 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 3: Covariant ﬁeld theory so charge is conserved. This equation can also be written ∂ρ ∂t + ⃗∇ · ⃗J = 0 Let us integrate this over a surface Σ, ∫ Σ ∂ρ ∂t d 3x + ∫ Σ ⃗∇ · ⃗Jd 3x = 0 ⇒ ∂ ∂t ∫ Σ ρ d 3x + ∫ ∂Σ ⃗J · d ⃗Ad3x = 0 or ∂q ∂t + ∫ ∂Σ ⃗J · d ⃗A = 0 We see that invariance under gauge transformations leads to charge conservation. In fact there is a close relationship between certain types of transformational invariance and conser- vation laws, which we treat in detail in the next section. 16 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 4: Noether’s theorem 4 Noether’s theorem Noether’s theorem states for every continuous symmetry there is a conserved quantity. 4.1 Derivation Let us suppose we have a Lagrangian density L(φ, ∂µφ, ε) invariant under a transformation φ → φ ∗ = φ + δφ x µ → x∗µ = xµ + ∆xµ parametrised by a small quantity ε such that φ ∗(ε = 0) = φ x∗µ(ε = 0) = xµ Now the change in xµ means that the volume we integrate over will change; that is, we have cδS = ∫ Σ′ L(φ ∗, x ∗µ)d 4x∗ − ∫ Σ L(φ, x µ)d4x ⇒ cδS = ∫ Σ[L(φ ∗, x µ) − L(φ, x µ)]d4x + ∫ ∂Σ L∆xµdΣµ where dΣµ is a surface element (in the xµ-direction) and ∆xµdΣµ can be thought of as giving the change in the boundary ∂Σ caused by the transformation of the coordinates (for more details see Classical Mechanics by Goldstein, 3rd edition, page 592). We have also switched dummy variables in the ﬁrst integral from x∗µ to xµ. Now the ﬁrst integrand is just the variation of L with respect to φ, that is ∫ [∂L ∂φ δφ + ∂L ∂(∂µφ)δ(∂µφ) ] d4x = ∫ [ ∂µ ( ∂L ∂(∂µφ)δφ) + ( ∂L ∂φ − ∂µ ∂L ∂(∂µφ) ) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ =0 (E-L) δφ ] d4x while the second can be rewritten using the divergence theorem ∫ ∂Σ L∆xµdΣµ = ∫ Σ ∂µ (L∆xµ) d 4x hence cδS = ∫ Σ ∂µ [ ∂L ∂(∂µφ)δφ + L∆xµ] d 4x = 0 Now, consider δφ = φ ∗(xρ) − φ(xρ) = φ ∗(x∗ρ) − φ(xρ) − [φ ∗(x∗ρ) − φ ∗(xρ)] 17 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 4: Noether’s theorem We now Taylor expand φ ∗(x∗ρ) with respect to xρ, obtaining φ ∗(x∗ρ) − φ ∗(xρ) ≈ φ∗(xρ) + ∂νφ ∗(xρ)∆xν − φ ∗(xρ) = ∂νφ ∗(xρ)∆xν or, using φ ∗ = φ + δφ φ ∗(x∗ρ) − φ ∗(xρ) ≈ ∂νφ(xρ)∆xν + ∂νδφ∆xν and the term on the right is of second order and so can be neglected. Similarly we expand φ ∗(xρ) with respect to ε to ﬁnd φ∗(x∗ρ) − φ(xρ) ≈ φ ∗(x∗ρ) ∣ ∣ ∣ε=0 + ε∂φ∗ ∂ε ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ε=0 − φ(xρ) = φ(xρ) + ε ∂φ∗ ∂ε ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ε=0 − φ(xρ) = ε∂φ∗ ∂ε ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ε=0 and as we also have ∆xµ = x∗µ − xµ ≈ ∂x∗µ ∂ε |ε=0, cδS = ∫ Σ ∂µ [ ∂L ∂(∂µφ)ε ∂φ∗ ∂ϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 − ( ∂L ∂(∂µφ)∂νφ − δµ ν L) ε∂x∗ν ∂ϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 ] d 4x = 0 and so we can conclude that the current J µ = ∂L ∂(∂µφ) ∂φ∗ ∂ϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 − ( ∂L ∂(∂µφ)∂νφ − gµνL ) ∂x∗ ν ∂ϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 is conserved. In the case of a vector ﬁeld A λ this becomes J µ = ∂L ∂(∂µAλ) ∂A∗λ ∂ϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 − ( ∂L ∂(∂µAλ)∂νAλ − gµνL) ∂x∗ ν ∂ϵ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ϵ=0 Note that this derivation assumes ε has no indices (i.e. is a scalar). To be more precise we should take into account the possibility that ε may be a vector or even matrix quantity, and write it as εα where α stands for any possible index. In this case we should go back to the second from last line of the proof and extract the conserved quantity J µαεα = ( ∂L ∂(∂µφ) ∂φ∗ ∂εα ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣εα=0 − ( ∂L ∂(∂µφ)∂νφ − gµνL) ∂x∗ ν ∂ϵα ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣εα=0 ) εα where there is now one conserved current J µα for each εα (see example iv) below). 4.2 Examples Let us assume that the ﬁeld does not change, i.e. φ ∗(x) = φ(x). 18 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 4: Noether’s theorem i) Let L be invariant under time translation, x∗0 = x0 + ε, x∗i = xi, then J 0 = ∂L ∂(∂0φ)∂0φ − L ≡ H is conserved (this is the Hamiltonian for the ﬁeld). ii) Suppose L invariant under x∗µ = xµ + ε, then ∂L ∂(∂µφ)∂νφ − gµνL is conserved (this is the energy-momentum density for the ﬁeld). iii) Suppose L is symmetric under rotations about the x3 axis, that is, x∗1 = x1 cos ε + x2 sin ε x∗2 = −x1 sin ε + x2 cos ε x∗3 = x3 x∗0 = x0 then the angular momentum density of the ﬁeld is conserved, ∂L ∂(∂3φ)(x1∂2φ − x2∂1φ) iv) Suppose that L is completely rotationally invariant in the space dimensions. An inﬁnites- imal rotation can be written as xi ↦→ xi + εijxj where εij = −εji is a three by three skew-symmetric real matrix, and so an element of so(3) (i.e. a generator of rotations). We then have that −J ijkεjk =   ∂L ∂(∂iφ)∂lφ − gilL ∂x∗ l ∂ϵjk ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣εjk=0   εjk is conserved. Now, ∂x∗ l ∂ϵjk = ∂ εlnxn ∂ϵjk = δj l δk nxn − δj nδk l xn = δj l xk − δk l xj giving −J ijkεjk = ( ∂L ∂(∂iφ) (∂jφ xk − ∂kφ xj) − gijLxk + gikLxj ) εjk so we can pick out our conserved currents −J ijk = ∂L ∂(∂iφ) (∂jφ xk − ∂kφ xj) − gijLxk + gikLxj 19 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 4: Noether’s theorem For example, consider rotations about the x1 axis. Then we have the following conserved currents: −J 123 = ∂L ∂(∂1φ) (∂2φ x3 − ∂3φ x2) −J 112 = ∂L ∂(∂1φ) (∂1φ x2 − ∂2φ x1) − Lx2 −J 113 = ∂L ∂(∂1φ) (∂1φ x3 − ∂3φ x1) − Lx3 J 132 = −J 123 J 121 = −J 112 J 131 = −J 113 J 111 = J 112 = J 133 = 0 Note that J 132 corresponds to the angular momentum density about the x1 axis. 4.3 Stress-energy tensor If we assume that our system is invariant under the transformation xν → xν + εν then we have that the tensor T µν = ∂L ∂(∂µAλ)∂νAλ − gµνL is conserved (note we have changed the λ indices). This tensor is known as the stress-energy tensor. 4.3.1 Stress-energy tensor for electromagnetic ﬁeld For a free electromagnetic ﬁeld, L = − 1 16π FµνF µν. The stress energy tensor is given by T µν = − 1 16π ∂(FρσF ρσ) ∂(∂µAλ) ∂νAλ + 1 16π gµνFρσF ρσ ⇒ T µν = − 1 4π F µλ∂νAλ + 1 16π gµνFρσF ρσ Although conserved, T µν is not gauge invariant (as Aλ appears explicitly) or symmetric. We can form a tensor with nicer properties as follows: ﬁrst, write F µλ∂νAλ = F µ λ∂νA λ = gµρFρλ∂νA λ giving T µν = − 1 4π gµρFρλ∂νA λ + 1 16π gµνFρσF ρσ and then substitute in ∂νA λ = F νλ + ∂λA ν to obtain T µν = − 1 4π gµρFρλF νλ − 1 4π gµρFρλ∂λA ν + 1 16π gµνFρσF ρσ and now deﬁne Θ µν = T µν + 1 4π gµρFρλ∂λA ν 20 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 4: Noether’s theorem ⇒ Θ µν = 1 4π gµρFρλF λν + 1 16π gµνFρσF ρσ (note interchange of µ and ν to remove the leading minus sign). This tensor is conserved as the diﬀerence between it and the stress-energy tensor is 1 4π gµρFρλ∂λAν = 1 4π F λµ∂λAν and ∂µ(F λµ∂λA ν) = (∂µF λµ)∂λAν + F λµ∂µ∂λA ν = 0 where the ﬁrst term vanishes due to the equations of motion and the second term vanishes as it is the contraction of a symmetric and antisymmetric tensor. The tensor Θµν is gauge invariant, symmetric, traceless (Θµ µ = Θ µνgµν = 0) and can be used to deﬁne the angular momentum density M µνσ = Θ µνxσ − Θ µσxν. But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over the dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. Bram Stoker, Dracula 21 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations 5 Solving Maxwell’s equations We now wish to solve the equation ∂µF µν = 4π c J ν for a given J ν. This equation can be written ∂µ∂µAν − ∂µ∂νAµ = 4π c J ν We impose the Lorenz gauge, ∂µAµ = 0 so that this becomes ∂µ∂µAν = 4π c J ν This equation will be solved using Green’s function methods. Recall that given some dif- ferential equation Df (x) = g(x) the Green’s function G solves DG(x) = δ(x); so that f = ∫ dx′G(x − x′)g(x′) as then Df = ∫ dx′DG(x − x′)g(x′) = ∫ dx′δ(x − x′)g(x′) = g(x). We will apply Fourier transform methods to obtain the Green’s functions we need. The four-dimensional Fourier transform and its inverse are f (xµ) = 1 (2π)2 ∫ d4k e−ikν xν ˜f (kµ) ˜f (kµ) = 1 (2π)2 ∫ d 4x e ikν xν f (xµ) The Fourier representation of the delta-function is δ(x) = 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ dk e−ikx 5.1 Time-independent solutions First let us obtain solutions with no time dependence. This means we will be solving the equation ⃗∇2Aν = −4π c J ν 5.1.1 Green’s function We need to ﬁnd a Green’s function satisfying ⃗∇2G(⃗x) = δ3(⃗x). In terms of Fourier transforms, this is ⃗∇ 2 1 (2π)3/2 ∫ d3k e−i⃗k·⃗x ˜G(⃗k) = − 1 (2π)3/2 ∫ d3k ⃗k2e −i⃗k·⃗x ˜G(⃗k) = 1 (2π)3 ∫ d3k e−i⃗k·⃗x ⇒ ˜G(⃗k) = − 1 (2π)3/2 1 ⃗k2 giving G(⃗x) = − 1 (2π)3 ∫ d 3k 1 ⃗k2 e −i⃗k·⃗x = ∫ ∞ 0 dα ∫ d 3k e−i⃗k·⃗x−α⃗k2 22 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations as ∫ ∞ 0 dα e −αx = 1 α . Now the k integral can be expressed as a Gaussian: ∫ d 3k e−i⃗k·⃗x−α⃗k2 = ∫ d3k e−α“ ⃗k+ ⃗ix 2α ”2e − ⃗x2 4α = ( π α )3/2 e− ⃗x2 4α so we now have G(⃗x) = − 1 (2π)3 π3/2 ∫ ∞ 0 dα ( 1 α )3/2 e− ⃗x2 4α Let u = α−1/2, then −2du = α−3/2dα and we have G(⃗x) = 1 4π3/2 ∫ 0 ∞ du e − ⃗x2 4 u2 = − 1 4π3/2 1 2 √4π ⃗x2 using the fact that the Gaussian integral is symmetric, and hence G(⃗x) = − 1 4π|⃗x| 5.1.2 Magnetostatic and electrostatic potentials For an electrostatic system, we have ⃗∇ 2A 0 = ⃗∇2Φ = −4πρ(⃗x) = − 4π c ∑ e e δ3(⃗x − ⃗xe), where the sum ranges over the diﬀerent charges in the system, with ⃗xe signifying the position of the charge e. Using the Green’s function above we see that Φ(⃗x) = ∫ d3x′ ρ(⃗x′) |⃗x − ⃗x′| = ∫ d 3x′ ∑ e e δ3(⃗x ′ − ⃗x e) |⃗x − ⃗x′| = ∑ e e |⃗x − ⃗xe| giving ⃗E = −⃗∇Φ = ∑ e e ⃗x − ⃗xe |⃗x − ⃗xe|3 Similarly the vector potential is given by ⃗A(⃗x) = 1 c ∫ d3x′ ⃗J(x′) |⃗x − ⃗x′| 5.2 Time-dependent solutions We will now seek solutions of the full equation ∂µ∂µAν = 4π c J ν 23 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations 5.2.1 Green’s function The Green’s function we seek is a solution D(zρ) of ∂µ∂µD(zρ) = δ4(zρ) where zρ = xρ − x′ ρ. Appealing to Fourier transforms again, we have ∂µ∂µ 1 (2π)2 ∫ d 4k ˜D(k)e−ikν zν = − 1 (2π)2 ∫ d4k kµkµ ˜D(kµ)e −ikν zν = 1 (2π)4 ∫ d4k e−ikν zν from which ˜D(kµ) = − 1 4π2 1 kµkµ = − 1 4π 1 k2 0 − k2 where k = |⃗k|. We now must solve D(zµ) = − 1 (2π)4 ∫ d4k 1 k2 0 − k2 e −ikν zν = − 1 (2π)4 ∫ d3k ei⃗k·⃗z ∫ ∞ −∞ dk0 1 k2 0 − k2 e −ik0z0 Note the sign change in the ﬁrst exponential when converting to three-dimensions. Now, to evaluate the k0 integral we use contour integration, treating k0 as a complex number, k0 = Re k0 + iIm k0. This gives e i⃗k·⃗z = e Im k0z0e−iRe k0. So that the integral converges we must choose Im k0 < 0 for z0 > 0. This condition is imposed as z0 = x0 − x′0 = c(t − t ′), and so positive z0 ensures that contributions to the Green’s function and hence to the potential A µ only come from events that occur at times t ′ < t, i.e. events in the past. Thus causality is ensured. Now, the poles of the integrand are ±k and so lie on the real axis. To avoid them, we displace our contour by an inﬁnitesimal amount iϵ so that it lies just in the upper-half plane (formally we should let ϵ → 0 at the end). Our contour of integration Γ then looks like: Im k0 Re k0 R k−k Γ We than have ∮ Γ dk0 e −ik0z0 k2 0 − k2 = ∫ R −R dk0 e−ik0z0 k2 0 − k2 + ∫ semi-circle e −ik0z0 k2 0 − k2 Now on the semicircle we can write k0 = Re−iϕ = R cos ϕ − iR sin ϕ, so that the integral becomes an integral over ϕ from 0 to π. So we have ∫ semi-circle e −ik0z0 k2 0 − k2 = −i ∫ π 0 dϕ Re iϕe −Rz0 sin ϕ−iRz0 cos ϕ 1 R2e−2iϕ − k2 24 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations and sin ϕ ≥ 0 for this range of ϕ, hence the integrand goes to zero as R → ∞, as required. The value of the k0 integral we are interested in will hence be given by the −2πi times the sum of the residues inside the contour. The residues are: lim k0→k(k0 − k) e −ik0z0 (k0 − k)(k0 + k) = e −ikz0 2k lim k0→−k(k0 + k) e−ik0z0 (k0 − k)(k0 + k) = −e ikz0 2k hence ∫ ∞ −∞ dk0 1 k2 0 − k2 e −ik0z0 = πi k (eikz0 − e−ikz0) Θ(z0) where the Heaviside function Θ(z0) = { 1 z0 > 0 0 z0 < 0 is added as the residues only contribute for positive z0. So we now have D(zµ) = Θ(z0) (2π)4 πi ∫ d3k ei⃗k·⃗z 1 k (e ikz0 − e−ikz0) = Θ(z0) 16π3 i ∫ ∞ 0 dk k2 1 k (e ikz0 − e −ikz0) ∫ 2π 0 dφ ∫ π 0 dθ sin θ e ikz cos θ upon switching to polar coordinates and choosing the coordinate frame such that the k3 axis makes an angle of θ with ⃗z, and letting z = |⃗z|. Integrating over the angles, we get D(zµ) = Θ(z0) 8π2 i ∫ ∞ 0 dk k (e ikz0 − e −ikz0) ( e ikz ikz − e −ikz ikz ) = −Θ(z0) 8π2z ∫ ∞ 0 dk (e ik(z0+z) + e −ik(z0+z) − e ik(z0−z) − e−ik(z0−z)) but if we let k ↦→ −k ∫ ∞ 0 dk e−ik(z0+z) = ∫ −∞ 0 d(−k)e ik(z0+z) = ∫ 0 −∞ dk eik(z0+z) hence D(zµ) = −Θ(z0) 8π2z ∫ ∞ −∞ dk (eik(z+z0) − e ik(z0−z)) = Θ(z0) 4πz ( δ(z0 − z) − δ(z0 + z) ) remembering the integral representation of the delta function. Owing to the Heaviside func- tion only the ﬁrst delta function will contribute, so Dret(zµ) = Θ(z0) 4πz δ(z0 − z) 25 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations The subscript signiﬁes that this is the retarded Green’s function (that is, the Green’s function resulting from the contribution of events in the past). We can put the Green’s function in covariant form using δ(zµzµ) = δ([z0 − z][z0 + z]) = δ(z0 − z) |z0 + z| + δ(z0 + z) |z0 − z| as δ(ab) = δ(a) |b| + δ(b) |a| . Hence Θ(z0)δ(zµzµ) = Θ(z0)δ(z0 − z) |z0 + z| = Θ(z0)δ(z0 − z) |2z| and so Dret(zµ) = Θ(z0) 2π δ(zµzµ) Recalling that zµ = xµ − x′µ we can state our ﬁnal results for the Green’s function as Dret(xµ − x′µ) = Θ(x0 − x′0) 4πz δ(x0 − x′0 − |⃗x − ⃗x′|) and in covariant form, Dret(xµ − x′µ) = Θ(x0 − x′0) 2π δ([xµ − x′ µ][xµ − x′µ]) Note that if we had taken z0 < 0 and closed our contour in the upper half-plane (with poles displaced upwards) we would have obtained the advanced Green’s function Dadv(xµ − x′µ) = Θ(x′0 − x0) 4πz δ(x0 − x′0 + |⃗x − ⃗x′|) 5.2.2 Lienard-Wiechart potentials Of night and light and the half-light. W.B. Yeats, “He Wishes For The Cloths Of Heaven” We can now work out the potentials Aµ that solve the Maxwell equation ∂µ∂µAν = 4π c J ν. They are given by A µ(xσ) = 4π c ∫ d4x′Dret(x − x′)J µ(x′σ) where J µ(x′σ) = e dx′σ dt′ δ3(⃗x ′ − ⃗x ′ e(t)) or in covariant form J µ(x′σ) = ec ∫ dτ dx ′σ dτ δ4(x′σ − x′σ e (τ )) 26 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations as integrating over τ and using that δ(f (τ )) = ∑ i:f (τi)=0 δ(τ − τi) |f ′(τi)| we have J µ(x′σ) = ec dx′σ dτ ∣ ∣ ∣τ ′δ3(⃗x ′ − ⃗x ′ e(t)) ( dx ′0 dτ )−1 ∣ ∣ ∣τ ′ where x′0 − x0 e(τ ′) = 0. Now, dx′0 dτ |τ ′ = dx′0 dt dt dτ |τ ′ = c dt dτ |τ ′ and dx′σ dτ |τ ′ = dx′σ dt dt dτ |τ ′ so this reduces to the local form. So substituting this in, we have A µ(xσ) = 4π c ∫ dτ d 4x′ Θ(x0 − x′0) 2π δ([xσ − x′ σ][xσ − x′σ])ec dx′σ dτ δ4(x′σ − x′σ e (τ )) = 2e ∫ dτ Θ(x0 − x0 e)δ([xσ − xe σ(τ )][xσ − xσ e (τ )])V µ(τ ) where we have written V µ ≡ dx µ e dτ . Now, we need the roots of the argument of the delta function: [xσ − xe σ(τ )][xσ − xσ e (τ )] = 0 ⇒ (x0 − xe 0(τ )) 2 − |⃗x − ⃗xe(τ )| 2 = 0 There are two possibilities: x0 − xe 0(τ ) = ±|⃗x − ⃗xe(τ )| The Heaviside function constrains us to choose the positive option. We see that the unique root of [xσ − xe σ(τ )][xσ − xσ e (τ )] = 0 which ensures causality is given by the retarded time τ0: x0 − xe 0(τ0) = |⃗x − ⃗xe(τ0)| Physically, the retarded time gives the unique time at which the charged particle intersects the past light-cone of the observation point. Now, as d dτ [xσ − xe σ(τ )][xσ − xσ e (τ )] = −2[xσ − xe σ(τ )] d dτ xσ e (τ ) We then have that Θ(x0 − x0 e)δ([xσ − xe σ(τ )][xσ − xσ e (τ )]) = δ(τ − τ0) 2[xσ − xe σ(τ0)]V σ(τ0) so, writing Rσ = xσ − xσ e (τ0), we have Aµ(xσ) = V µ(τ ) Rσ(τ )V σ(τ ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣τ0 Note that the retarded time is in this notation deﬁned by Rσ(τ0)Rσ(τ0) = 0 and that then R0 = R = | ⃗R| = |⃗x − ⃗x µ e (τ0)|. 27 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations 5.2.3 Electromagnetic ﬁelds from Lienard-Wiechart potentials: method one We wish to evaluate the electromagnetic ﬁelds F µν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ arising from the motion of a charged particle. Consider the integral expression for the potential A ν(xσ) = 2e ∫ dτ Θ(x0 − x0 e)δ([xσ − xe σ(τ )] 2)V ν(τ ) We will diﬀerentiate this with respect to xµ. First, note that ∂µΘ(x0 − x0 e) = δ(x0 − x0 e) and this will give a term δ(−|⃗x − ⃗x e(τ )] 2) which only contributes for ⃗x = ⃗x e(τ ) and can be neglected. Thus we have ∂µA ν = 2e ∫ dτ Θ(x0 − x0 e)∂µδ([xσ − xe σ(τ )] 2)V ν(τ ) Let us now write ∂µδ([xσ − xe σ(τ )] 2) = ∂µδ(Rσ(τ )Rσ(τ )) = ∂ ∂RσRσ δ(Rσ(τ )Rσ(τ ))∂µ(RσRσ) = d dτ δ(Rσ(τ )Rσ(τ )) ∂τ ∂RσRσ ∂µ(RσRσ) and as Rσ = xσ − xσ e (τ ) we have ∂µ(RσRσ) = 2Rµ and d dτ (RσRσ) = −2RσV σ ⇒ dτ dRσRσ = − 1 2RσV σ so (using ρ as our dummy variable in the denominator as σ is used in the numerator) ∂µδ([xσ − xe σ(τ )] 2) = − Rµ RρV ρ d dτ δ(Rσ(τ )Rσ(τ )) Thus ∂µA ν = −2e ∫ dτ Θ(x0 − x0 e)RµV ν RρV ρ d dτ δ(Rσ(τ )Rσ(τ )) and we can integrate this by parts to obtain ∂µAν = 2e ∫ dτ Θ(x0 − x0 e)δ(Rσ(τ )Rσ(τ )) d dτ (RµV ν RρV ρ ) Recalling from the derivation of the potentials that Θ(x0 − x0 e)δ(Rσ(τ )Rσ(τ )) = δ(τ − τ0) 2Rσ(τ0)V σ(τ0) 28 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations we ﬁnd ∂µA ν = e RσV σ d dτ ( RµV ν RρV ρ ) with this evaluated at the retarded time. Carrying out the diﬀerentiation, with a dot denoting a derivative with respect to proper time, ∂µA ν = e RσV σ (−V µV ν + Rµ ˙V ν RρV ρ − RµV ν (RρV ρ)2 (−VλV λ + Rλ ˙V λ)) and hence F µν = eVρV ρ (RσV σ)3 (RµV ν − RνV µ) + e (RσV σ)2 (Rµ ˙V ν − Rν ˙V µ) − eRρ ˙V ρ (RσV σ)3 ( RµV ν − RνV µ) Note that we can write F µν as a sum of two parts, one a velocity ﬁeld containing terms depending on V µ and the other an acceleration or radiative ﬁeld containing derivatives of the velocity, ˙V µ: F µν = F µν vel + F µν rad where F µν vel = eVρV ρ (RσV σ)3 (RµV ν − RνV µ) and F µν rad = e (RσV σ)2 (Rµ ˙V ν − Rν ˙V µ) − eRρ ˙V ρ (RσV σ)3 (RµV ν − RνV µ) 5.2.4 Electromagnetic ﬁelds from Lienard-Wiechart potentials: method two Consider the covariant form of the equation deﬁning the retarded time: Rσ(τ0)Rσ(τ0) = 0 This equation deﬁnes τ0 as a function of the observation point xµ. To ﬁnd how τ0 changes with xµ we diﬀerentiate ∂µ(Rσ(τ0)Rσ(τ0)) = 0 ⇒ 2Rσ∂µRσ = 0 Now, ∂µRσ = ∂µxσ − ∂µxe(τ ) = δσ µ − d dτ xσ e (τ )∂µτ = δσ µ − V µ∂µτ so at the retarded time Rσ(δσ µ − V µ∂µτ0) = 0 and hence ∂µτ0 = Rµ RσV σ ⇒ ∂µτ0 = Rµ RσV σ 29 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations with the expression on the right evaluated at the retarded time. We will use this to now evaluate the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor resulting from the four- potential Aν(xρ) = eV ν V σRσ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣τ0 In what follows we will denote diﬀerentiation with respect to proper time by a dot. Note that our expressions must all be evaluated at the retarded time - so in eﬀect we will work out ∂µA ν treating Rσ and Vσ as functions of τ with the awareness that in reality everything we do is evaluated at τ0. This allows us to substitute the above expression for ∂µτ0 for ∂µτ as we derive. So we have ∂µAν = e ∂µV ν VσRσ − eV ν (V σRσ)2 ((∂µV ρ)Rρ + V ρ(∂µRρ) ) = e ˙V ν∂µτ VσRσ − eV ν (V σRσ)2 ( ˙V ρRρ∂µτ + V ρ(δµ ρ − Vρ∂µτ ) ) = e ˙V νRµ (VσRσ)2 − eV ν (V σRσ)2 ( ˙V ρRρRµ V σRσ + V µ − V ρVρRµ RσV σ ) = e RµV νV ρVρ (V σRσ)3 − eV µV ν (V σRσ)2 + eRµ ˙V ν (V σRσ)2 − eRµV ν ˙V ρRρ (V σRσ)3 Hence we again ﬁnd we can write F µν = ∂µA ν − ∂νA µ as a sum of two parts, one involving terms containing the four-velocity of the charge V µ and the other involving terms involving the acceleration ˙V µ, that is, F µν = F µν vel + F µν rad where F µν vel = ec 2 (V σRσ)3 (RµV ν − RνV µ) and F µν rad = e (V σRσ)2 (Rµ ˙V ν − Rν ˙V µ) − e ˙V ρRρ (V σRσ)3 (RµV ν − RνV µ) where we have used that V ρVρ = γ2c2 − γ2v2 = γ2c2(1 − v2/c 2) = c2. 5.2.5 Properties of the electromagnetic ﬁelds due to a moving charge We can immediately work out some important properties of the velocity and radiative ﬁelds. Consider RµF µν vel = − ec 2 (V σRσ)3 RνV µ ̸= 0 30 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations where we have used that RµRµ = 0 at the retarded time (remember that all our expressions for the ﬁelds are evaluated at τ0), and RµF µν rad = −eRµRν ˙V µ (V σRσ)2 + e ˙V ρRρRµRνV µ (V σRσ)3 = 0 upon making a single fraction and switching some of the dummy variables to agree. Setting ν in RµF µν acc to zero and j successively we ﬁnd RµF µ0 rad = 0 ⇒ RiF i0 rad = 0 ⇒ RiEi rad = 0 ⇒ ⃗n · ⃗Erad = 0 RµF µj rad = R0F 0j rad + RiF ij rad = −REj + RiεijkBk = 0 ⇒ Ej = −εjik Ri R Bk ⇒ ⃗E = −⃗n × ⃗B where ⃗n is a unit direction in the direction of ⃗R. Note that this implies ⃗n, ⃗Erad and ⃗Brad are mutually orthogonal and have the same magnitude (in Gaussian/Heaviside-Lorentz units). We can similarly consider the dual tensor, ˜F αβ = ϵ αβµνFµν. For both F µν vel and F µν rad we see every term in Rα ˜F αβ = ϵ αβµνRαFµν will contain ϵ αβµνRαRµ or ϵ αβµνRαRν and hence contract to zero. Thus, Rµ ˜F µν = 0 and hence ⃗n · ⃗B = 0 ⃗B = ⃗n × ⃗E 5.2.6 Local form of the electromagnetic ﬁelds due to a moving charge To transform our covariant expressions for F µν vel and F µν rad to our local frame we recall that V µ = γ(c, ⃗v) = γ(c, c⃗β), where ⃗v = c ⃗B. We need to work out ˙V µ = d dτ V µ. Now, d dτ = γ d dt , so we have d dτ γc = cγ d dt 1 √ 1 − ⃗β2 = cγ ⃗β · ⃗α √ 1 − ⃗β23 = cγ4 ⃗β · ⃗α where ⃗α = d dt ⃗β, and d dτ γcβ = cγ d dtγβ = cγ (⃗β d dtγ + γ d dt ⃗β) = cγ (⃗βγ3(⃗β · ⃗α) + γ⃗α) = cγ4(⃗β · ⃗α)⃗β + cγ2⃗α We also have that V σRσ = Rγc − γ ⃗V · ⃗R = γcR(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β). Hence we have Ei vel = F i0 vel = ec2 (V σRσ)3 (RiV 0 − R0V i) = ec 2 γ3c3R3(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β)3 (γcRi − Rγcβi) 31 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 5: Solving Maxwell’s equations so ⃗Evel = e(⃗n − ⃗β) γ2R2(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β)3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣t0 ⃗Bvel = ⃗n × ⃗Evel Turning to the radiative ﬁelds, we have Ei rad = F i0 rad = e (V σRσ)2 (Ri ˙V 0 − R0 ˙V i) − e ˙V ρRρ (V σRσ)3 (RiV 0 − R0V i) so, writing ⃗R = R⃗n, γ3c3R3(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) 3 e ⃗Erad = γcR (1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) ( γ4cR⃗n⃗β · ⃗α − R [cγ4(⃗β · ⃗α)⃗β + cγ2⃗α]) − (γ4cR⃗β · ⃗α − γ4cR(⃗β · ⃗α)⃗n · ⃗β − γ2cR⃗n · ⃗α) ( cγR⃗n − cγR⃗β) = γ5c2R2[ (1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) (⃗β · ⃗α(⃗n − ⃗β) − ⃗α γ2 ) − (⃗β · ⃗α(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) − ⃗n · ⃗α γ2 ) ( ⃗n − ⃗β) ] = γ5c2R2[ 1 γ2 ⃗α(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) + (⃗n − ⃗β) (⃗β · ⃗α(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) − ⃗β · ⃗α(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) + 1 γ2 ⃗n · ⃗α ] = γ3c2R2 [ (⃗n − ⃗β)⃗n · ⃗α − ⃗α(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) ] hence ⃗Erad = e cR ⃗n · ⃗α(⃗n − ⃗β) − ⃗α(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) (1 − ⃗n · ⃗β)3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣t0 ⃗Brad = ⃗n × ⃗Erad We can use the vector identity ⃗a × (⃗b ×⃗c) = ⃗b(⃗a ·⃗c) −⃗c(⃗a ·⃗b) with ⃗a = ⃗n, ⃗b = ⃗n − ⃗β and ⃗c = ⃗α to see that ⃗n × ([⃗n − ⃗β] × ⃗α) = ⃗n · ⃗α(⃗n − ⃗β) − ⃗α(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) so we can write the radiative electric ﬁeld as ⃗Erad = e Rc ⃗n × ([⃗n − ⃗β] × ⃗α) (1 − ⃗n · ⃗β)3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣t0 32 Notes for Classical Field Theory Section 6: Power radiated by accelerating charge 6 Power radiated by accelerating charge The essential idea is that the energy ﬂux per unit area in the direction ⃗n is given by ⃗S · ⃗n where ⃗S = c 4π ⃗Erad × ⃗Brad is the Poynting vector. We have that ⃗Erad is perpendicular to ⃗Brad and ⃗n is perpendicular to both with ⃗Brad = ⃗n × ⃗Erad, so |⃗n · ⃗S| = c 4π | ⃗Erad| 2 Now the diﬀerential power radiated into a solid angle element dΩ in the direction ⃗n is dP = R2|⃗n · ⃗S|dΩ This expression is in terms of the time t at the observation point; it is often more convenient to work with the time t ′ in the charge’s own frames. We can write the energy radiated between times t1 and t2 as E = ∫ t2 t1 |⃗n · ⃗S|dt dΩR2 = ∫ t′ 2 t′ 1 |⃗n · ⃗S| dt dt′ dt ′dΩR2 so we see that we should deﬁne dP (t ′) = R2|⃗n · ⃗S|dΩ dt dt′ = R2 c 4π | ⃗Erad| 2dΩ dt dt′ To evaluate the derivative, we use that ct − ct ′ = R from the deﬁnition of the retarded time. As R = | ⃗R| = |⃗x − ⃗xe(t ′) we ﬁnd dt dt′ − 1 = − ⃗R · ⃗v Rc ⇒ dt dt′ = 1 − ⃗n · ⃗β and hence dP (t ′) dΩ = R2 c 4π | ⃗Erad| 2(1 − ⃗n · ⃗β) and using the expression for ⃗Erad evaluated in the preceding section we have dP (t′) dΩ = e 2 4πc ∣ ∣ ∣⃗n × ([⃗n − ⃗β] × ⃗α) ∣ ∣ ∣2 (1 − ⃗n · ⃗β)5 with this expression evaluated at the retarded time. An important consequence of the electromagnetic radiation of an accelerating charged particle is that classically an electron turning in circular motion will lose energy due to radiation, leading to a decay of its orbit.
