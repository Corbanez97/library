Unfortunately, the SU (2) symmetry of a spin is lifted by magnetic ﬁelds and it’s generally diﬃcult to get rid of stray ﬁelds. Rather than symmetry, in what follows we will look to topology to provide us with physically protected degeneracies in quantum systems. In particular, we will examine a number of exactly solvable models in one and two dimensions which exhibit topologically phases – that is, gapped phases with a protected ground state degeneracy dependent on the topology of the manifold in which the quantum model is embedded. In Sec. 2 we warm up with the study of several quantum chains that exhibit Majorana edge modes and thus a two-fold degeneracy on open chains. The topological phenomena available in two dimensional models are much richer and will be the focus of the remaining three sections. We introduce and solve the toric code on the square lattice in Sec. 3, exhibiting its topolological degeneracy and excitation spectrum explicitly. The following section steps back to examine the general phenomenology of quasiparticle statistics braiding in two dimensional models. Finally, in Sec. 5 we introduce the honeycomb lattice model which exhibits several kinds of topological phases, including that of the simple toric code and, in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, a gapped phase with chiral edge modes protected by the topology of the Fermi surface. 2 Topological phenomena in 1D: boundary modes in the Majorana chain4Topological phenomena in 1D: boundary modes in the Majorana chain HF = w N −1∑ j=1 (aj − a† j)(aj+1 + a† j+1) − µ N∑ j=1 (a† jaj − 1/2) . (2.4) This model has a Z2 symmetry given by the fermionic parity operator: PF = (−1) P j a † j aj (2.5) Although the two models are mathematically equivalent, as we will see in Sec. 2.2, they are clearly physically diﬀerent. In particular, for the superconductor, the Z2 symmetry of fermionic parity cannot be lifted by any local physical operator, as such operators must contain an even number of fermion operators. Unfortunately, for the spin system the degeneracy is lifted by a simple longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld hx ∑j σx j and thus the topological phase of the TFIM would be much harder to ﬁnd in nature. 2.1 Nature of topological degeneracy (spin language) Consider the transverse ﬁeld Ising model of Eq. (2.1). With no applied ﬁeld, there are a pair of Ising ground states (hz = 0): |ψ→〉 = | →→→ · · · → 〉 , |ψ←〉 = | ←←← · · · ← 〉 . (2.6) The introduction of a small ﬁeld hz allows the spins to ﬂip in the σx basis. In particular, tunneling between the two classical ground states arises via a soliton (domain-wall) propagating from one side of the system to the other: | →→→ · · · → 〉 −→ | ←:→→ · · · → 〉 −→ | ←←:→ · · · → 〉 (2.7) −→ | ←←←: · · · → 〉 −→ · · · −→ | ←←← · · · ← 〉. (2.8) As usual, the tunneling amplitude t associated with this transition falls oﬀ exponen- tially in the distance the soliton must propagate t ∼ e−N/ξ (2.9) where ξ is the correlation length of the model. The two-fold degeneracy is therefore lifted by the eﬀective Hamiltonian: Heﬀ = ( 0 −t −t 0 ) . (2.10) The splitting is exponentially small in the system size and the two-fold degeneracy is recovered in the thermodynamic limit as expected. Moreover, it is clear why introduc- tion of a longitudinal ﬁeld hx will fully split the degeneracy. 2.2 Reduction of TFIM to SPSC by the Jordan-Wigner transformation To show the equivalence of the one dimensional models introduced above, we will use a standard Jordan-Wigner transformation to convert the spins of the Ising model into Majorana operators5 fermions. It is perhaps not surprising that a fermionic description exists for spin 1/2 systems – we simplify identify the up and down state of each spin with the presence or absence of a fermion. The only diﬃculty arises in arranging the transformation so that the appropriate (anti)-commutation relations hold in each description. The Jordan-Wigner transformation does this by introducing string-like fermion operators that work out quite nicely in 1-D nearest neighbor models. To reduce HS to HF , we 1. Associate the projection onto the z-axis of the spin with the fermionic occupation number: | ↑ 〉 ↔ n = 0, | ↓ 〉 ↔ n = 1. (2.11) That is, σz j = (−1) a † j aj . (2.12) 2. Introduce the string-like annihilation and creation operators aj = (j−1∏ k=1 σz k ) σ+ j a† j = (j−1∏ k=1 σz k ) σ− j (2.13) where σ+ and σ− are the usual spin raising and lower operators. At this stage, we can check that the usual fermionic anticommutation relations hold for the aj, a† j: {ai, a† j} = δij (2.14) 3. Observe that σx j σx j+1 = −(aj − a† j)(aj+1 + a† j+1), (2.15) so HS (Eq. (2.1)) reduces to HF (Eq. (2.4)) with w = J, µ = −2hz (2.16) 2.3 Majorana operators Majorana operators provide a convenient alternative representation of Fermi systems when the number of particles is only conserved modulo 2, as in a superconductor. Given a set of N Dirac fermions with annihilation/creation operators aj, a† j, we can deﬁne a set of 2N real Majorana fermion operators as follows: c2j−1 = aj + a† j c2j = aj − a† j6Topological phenomena in 1D: boundary modes in the Majorana chain w c1 c6c5c4c3c2 c2N −1 c2N v w v w v vw Fig. 2.1 Majorana chain representation of 1-d superconductor. Each boxed pair of Majoranas corresponds to one site of the original fermionic chain. c2 k = 1, ckcl = −clck(k ̸= l). (2.18) Or, more compactly, {ck, cl} = 2δkl. (2.19) From any pair of Majorana operators, we can construct an annihilation and creation operator for a standard Dirac fermion (a = (c1 + ic2)/2 and h.c.), and thus the unique irreducible representation for the pair is a 2-dimensional Hilbert space which is either occupied or unoccupied by the a fermion. Both models HS and HF can be written as Hmaj = i General properties of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians7 2.4 General properties of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians We now step back and consider a generic quadratic fermionic Hamiltonian: H(A) = i8Topological phenomena in 1D: boundary modes in the Majorana chain bl = ∑ ukck (2.29) while an analogous calculation starting at the right end will ﬁnd a right boundary mode br. These modes form a Majorana canonical pair, leading to a two-fold degeneracy of the ground state of the chain. Clearly, uk ∼ e−k/ξ falls oﬀ exponentially from the edges of the chain with correlation length ξ−1 = ln ∣ ∣ w 3 The two-dimensional toric code10The two-dimensional toric code As = ∏ j∈star(s) σx j (3.2) while the plaquette operator acts on the four spins surrounding a plaquette, Bp = ∏ j∈∂p σz j . (3.3) Clearly, the As all commute with one another, as do the Bp. Slightly less trivially, AsBp = BpAs (3.4) because any given star and plaquette share an even number of edges (either none or two) and therefore the minus signs arising from the commutation of σx and σz on those edges cancel. Since all of the terms of HT commute, we expect to be able to solve it term by term. In particular, we will solve HT working in the σz basis. Deﬁne classical variables sj = ±1 to label the σz basis states. For each classical spin conﬁguration {s}, we can deﬁne the plaquette ﬂux wp(s) = ∏ j∈∂p sj. (3.5) If wp = −1, we say that there is a vortex on plaquette p. 3.1 Ground states To ﬁnd the ground states |Ψ〉 of HT , we need to minimize the energy, which means maximize the energy of each of the As and Bp terms. The plaquette terms provide the condition Bp|Ψ〉 = |Ψ〉 (3.6) which holds if and only if |Ψ〉 = ∑ {s:wp(s)=1 ∀p} cs|s〉 (3.7) . That is, the ground state contains no vortices. The group of star operators act on the conﬁgurations s by ﬂipping spins. Thus, the star conditions As|Ψ〉 = |Ψ〉 (3.8) hold if and only if all of the cs are equal for each orbit of the action of star operators. In particular, if the spin ﬂips of As are ergodic, as they are on the plane, all cs must be equal and the ground state is uniquely determined. On the torus, the star operators preserve the cohomology class of a vortex-free spin conﬁguration. In more physical terms, we can deﬁne conserved numbers given by the Wilson loop like functions wl(s) = ∏ j∈l sj, l = l1, l2 (3.9) where l1 and l2 are two independent non-trivial cycles on the square lattice wrapping the torus (Fig. 3.2). Any given star will overlap with a loop l in either zero or two Excitations11 l1 l2 Fig. 3.2 Large cycles on the torus. p2 W (e) l W (m) l∗ s2 s1 l l∗p1 Fig. 3.3 Electric and magnetic path operators. edges and therefore As preserves wl. Since there are two independent loops on the torus, each of which can have wl = ±1, there is a four-fold degenerate ground state: |Ψ〉 = ∑ {s:wp(s)=1 ∀p} cwl1 wl2 |s〉. (3.10) 3.2 Excitations The excitations of the toric code come in two varieties: the electric charges and mag- netic vortices of a Z2 gauge theory. We will see this connection more explicitly later. In the following, we restrict attention to the planar system for simplicity. To ﬁnd the electric charges, let us deﬁne the electric path operator W (e) l = ∏ j∈l σz j (3.11) where l is a path in the lattice going from s1 to s2 (see Fig. 3.3). This operator clearly commutes with the plaquette operators Bp and with all of the star operators As except for at the end points s1 and s2, where only one edge overlaps between the star and the path and we have W (e) l As1 = −As1 W (e) l . (3.12) Therefore, the state |Ψs1,s2 〉 = W (e) l |Ψ0〉 , (3.13) where |Ψ0〉 is the planar ground state, is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with excita- tions (charges) at s1 and s2 that each cost energy 2Je to create relative to the ground state.12The two-dimensional toric code An analogous construction will ﬁnd the magnetic vortices: we can deﬁne a dual path operator W (m) l∗ = ∏ j∈l∗ σx j (3.14) where the path l∗ lies in the dual lattice (see Fig. 3.3) and goes from p1 to p2. In this case, the stars As all commute with W (m) l∗ , as do all of the plaquette operators Bp except the two at the end points of l∗, which anticommute. Thus, the W (m) l∗ operator creates a pair of magnetic vortices on the plaquettes p1 and p2 at an energy of 2Jm each. 4 Abelian anyons and quasiparticle statistics14Abelian anyons and quasiparticle statistics Rba · Rab = a b a b (4.3) does. Let us illustrate this in the toric code model. In section 3.2 we found two kinds of quasiparticle excitations in the toric code: electric charges (e) and magnetic vortices (m). Since path operators of the same type commute with one another, it is easy to show that each of these are bosons. However, they have nontrivial mutual statistics. To calculate the mutual statistics, consider taking a charge e around a vortex m. m p1 e l Let |ξ〉 be some state containing a magnetic vortex at p1. Under the full braiding operation, |ξ〉 ↦→   ∏ j∈l σz j   |ξ〉 =   ∏ p inside l Bp   |ξ〉 (4.4) where the second line is a Stokes’ theorem like result relating the product around a loop to the products of internal loops. Since Bp1 |ξ〉 = −|ξ〉 (4.5) for the plaquette p1 containing the vortex, we have that |ξ〉 ↦→ −|ξ〉 , (4.6) or e m e m e me m e m = − e m (4.7) Superselection sectors and fusion rules15 Using the bosonic self-statistics equations, = e e ee e e ee = m m m m mmmm (4.8) we can derive the nontrivial corollary that composite e − m particles are fermions: m m e e m m m e me m e mee m e m e m e m = e e = − (4.9) 4.1 Superselection sectors and fusion rules Initially, we exhibited two kinds of bosonic excitations in the toric code model (charges e and vortices m) in the solution of the Hamiltonian. After a bit of work, we discovered that a composite e − m object has a meaningful characterization within the model as well, at least in that it has fermionic statistics. This begs the question, how many particle types exist in the toric code model and how can we identify them? We take an algebraic deﬁnition of a particle type: each type corresponds to a super- selection sector, which is a representation of the local operator algebra. In particular, we say that two particles (or composite objects) are of the same type a ∼ b (4.10) if a can be transformed to b by some operator acting in a ﬁnite region. For example, in the toric code, two e-particles are equivalent to having no particles at all, W (e) l e l e ↦−→ (4.11) by acting with an appropriate, geometrically bounded electric path operator W (e) l . We introduce the notation e × e = 1 (4.12) to represent the fusion rule that two e-particles are equivalent to the vacuum sector 1. In the toric code, there are 4 superselection sectors: 1, e, m, and ǫ = e × m (4.13)16Abelian anyons and quasiparticle statistics with the fusion rules: e × e = 1 e × m = ǫ m × m = 1 e × ǫ = m ǫ × ǫ = 1 m × ǫ = e (4.14) 4.2 Mutual statistics implies degeneracy on the torus This is an argument due to Einarsson (1990). Suppose that there are at least two particle types, e and m with −1 mutual statistics. Let us deﬁne an operator Z acting on the ground state in an abstract fashion (not refering to the actual model) which creates an e pair, wraps one particle around the torus and annihilates the pair. In the toric code, this will be the path operator W (e) l = ∏j∈l σz j for a loop l winding one of the nontrivial cycles on the torus, but we need not know that speciﬁcally. We can deﬁne another operator X that creates a pair of the other type m and winds around the other nontrivial cycle on the torus. But now a bit of geometric introspection reveals that the combination, em = −1Z −1X −1ZX = (4.15) Thus, there are two non-commuting operators acting on the ground state space L, and we conclude dim L > 1. In fact, there are four such operators, each of the two particle types can be moved around each of the two nontrivial cycles. Working out the commutation relations of these operators implies that dim L = 4. 4.3 The toric code in a ﬁeld: perturbation analysis We now apply a magnetic ﬁeld to the toric code that will realistically allow the quasi- particles to hop and, unfortunately, destroy its exact solvability (see Tupitsyn et al. (2008)). To wit: H = −Je ∑ s As − Jm ∑ p Bp − ∑ j ( hxσx j + hzσz j ) (4.16) For example, with hx = 0 but hz ̸= 0, we can view the perturbation as an electric path operator of length 1 on each edge. Hence, it can cause charge pair creation and annihilation (at an energy cost ∼ 4Je) or hop existing charges by one lattice displace- ment, at no cost. For small hz this provides a nontrivial tight-binding dispersion to the charges, ǫ(q) ≈ 2Je − 2hz(cos qx + cos qy) (4.17) but does not close the gap or lead to a change in the topological degeneracy of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit. At large hz ≫ Je, Jm, the model should simply align with the applied ﬁeld as a paramagnet. Clearly, in this limit the topological degeneracy has been destroyed and we have a unique spin-polarized ground state. The phase transition can be understood Robustness of the topological degeneracy17 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.00 0.10 0.20 hx hz self-duality line (I) (III) ~ ~ (II) Fig. 4.1 Numerically determined phase diagram of the toric code in a ﬁeld from Tupitsyn et al. (2008). (I) labels the topological phase, (II) and (III) the vortex and charge condensates (i.e. the paramagnetic phase). The numerics were done using discrete imaginary time with a rather large quantization step. from the topological side as a bose condensation of the charges, which proliferate as hz increases. The same argument is applicable if hx ≫ Je, Jm. If hx increases while hz = 0, then vortices condense. However, the high-ﬁeld phase is just a paramagnet, so one can continuously rotate the ﬁeld between the x- and z-direction without inducing a phase transition. Thus, the charge and vortex condensates are actually the same phase! This property was ﬁrst discovered by Fradkin and Shenker (1979) for a 3D classical Z2 gauge Higgs model, where it appears rather mysterious. 4.4 Robustness of the topological degeneracy The splitting of the ground state levels due to virtual quasiparticle tunneling is given by δE ∼ ∆e−L/ξ (4.18) This follows from the eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ = −(t1ZZ1 + t2Z Z2 + t1X X1 + t2X X2) (4.19) where the Zi, Xi operators are the winding loop operators of Sec. 4.2. Physically, this is simply a statement of the fact that the only way to act upon the ground state is to wind quasiparticles around the torus. This is a process exponentially suppressed in system size. 4.5 Emergent symmetry: gauge formulation There are two ways to introduce symmetry operators in the perturbed toric code model.18Abelian anyons and quasiparticle statistics 1. One can deﬁne loop operators (e.g. Z1, Z2, X1, X2), the deﬁnition of which depends on the actual ground state of the perturbed Hamiltonian. This is similar to the deﬁnition of the operator Y in the 1D case of Sec. 2.5, which also requires detailed knowledge of the ground state. 2. One can exploit gauge invariance by rewriting the model in a gauge invariant form. This can be done for any spin model by introducing redundancy. In this case, the symmetry does not depend on the model but is only manifest in the topological phase. We will take the second approach in order to avoid the diﬃculty of deﬁning the appropriate loop operators and also to introduce the important gauge formulation of the model. To gauge the model we proceed in steps: 1. Introduce one extra spin µv per vertex that always remains in the state 1 5 The honeycomb lattice model20The honeycomb lattice model where the spins and labels follow from the ﬁgure for each plaquette. Unfortunately, this is not quite enough: there are two spins but only one constraint per hexagon so that half of each spin remains unconstrained. In fact, the remaining degrees of freedom are Majorana operators! 5.1 A (redundant) representation of a spin by 4 Majorana operators We consider a collection of four Majorana operators c, bx, by and bz that act on the 4-dimensional Fock space F. We deﬁne the following three operators ˜σx = ibxc ˜σy = ibyc ˜σy = ibyc. (5.3) These operators do not obey the spin algebra relations on the full Fock space, but we clearly have two extra dimensions of wiggle room. In fact, the physical state space is identiﬁed with a two-dimensional subspace L ⊂ F given by the constraint D|Ψ〉 = |Ψ〉 , where D = bxbybzc (5.4) Within L, the ˜σα act as σα act on the actual spin. Of course, ˜σα also act on L ⊥, but we can ignore these states by enforcing the constraint. To be careful, we need to check two consistency conditions: 1. ˜σα preserves the subspace L, which follows from [˜σα, D] = 0. 2. The ˜σα satisfy the correct algebraic relations when restricted to L. For example, ˜σx ˜σy ˜σz = (ibxc)(ibyc)(ibzc) = i3(−1)bxbybzc3 = iD = i (5.5) where the last equality only holds in the physical subspace L. 5.2 Solving the Honeycomb Model using Majoranas We now use the Majorana representation of spins just introduced to rewrite each spin of the entire honeycomb model as in Fig. 5.2. This will greatly expand the 2N - dimensional Hilbert space to the Fock space F of dimension 22N , but the physical space L ⊂ F is ﬁxed by the gauge condition Dj|Ψ〉 = |Ψ〉 for all j (5.6) where Dj = bx j by j bz j c. We deﬁne a projector onto L by ΠL = ∏ j ( 1 + Dj Solving the Honeycomb Model using Majoranas21 b y b z b y b x c b z b y b x c b x b z b y c c b zb zb zb zb z b x b y b xb y c b z b y c b x b z c cb x b y cb x b y c b zb zb zb zb z b x c b zb zb zb zb z b x c b zb zb zb zb z b y c b zb zb zb zb z Fig. 5.2 Majorana representation of honeycomb model. ˆAjk = 2Jα(j,k) ˆujk ˆujk = ibα(j,k) j bα(j,k) k (5.8) where α(j, k) = x, y, z is the direction of the link between j and k. We have suggestively written the Hamiltonian ˜H as if it were a simple quadratic fermion Hamiltonian as in Sec. 2.4, but of course ˆAjk is secretly an operator rather than a real skew-symmetric matrix. However, each operator bα j enters only one term of the Hamiltonian and therefore ˆujk commute with each other and with ˜H! Thus, we can ﬁx ujk = ±1, deﬁning an orthogonal decomposition of the full Fock space: F = ⊕ u Fu, where |Ψ〉 ∈ Fu iﬀ ˆujk|Ψ〉 = ujk|Ψ〉 ∀ j, k (5.9) Within each subspace Fu, we need to solve the quadratic Hamiltonian ˜Hu = i22The honeycomb lattice model Thus, we ﬁnd Lw = ΠLFu (5.13) where wp = ∏ (j,k)∈∂p ujk. So we have a procedure for ﬁnding the ground state of the honeycomb model: 1. Fix wp = ±1 for all p. 2. Find ujk satisfying wp = ∏ (j,k)∈∂p ujk. (5.14) There is a small subtletly here in that ujk = −ukj so we must be careful about ordering. We can consistently take j in the even sublattice of the honeycomb and k in the odd sublattice in equation (5.14). 3. Solve for the ground state of the quadratic Hamiltonian (5.10), ﬁnding the energy E(w). 4. Project the found state onto the physical subspace (i.e. symmetrize over gauge transformations). 5. Repeat for all w; pick the w that minimizes the energy. If there were no further structure to E(w), this would be an intractable search problem in the space of wp. Fortunately, due to a theorem by Lieb (1994), the ground state has no vortices. That is, E(w) = min if wp = 1 ∀ p (5.15) Using this choice of wp, it is easy to solve the model and produce the phase diagram of Fig. 5.3. The gapless phase has two Dirac points in the fermionic spectrum. 5.3 Fermionic spectrum in the honeycomb lattice model We just need to diagonalize the Hamiltonian ˜Hu = i Quasiparticle statistics in the gapped phase23 gapped B Ax Ay Az ⃗J = (0, 0, 1) ⃗J = (1, 0, 0) ⃗J = (0, 1, 0) gapless gapped gapped Fig. 5.3 Phase diagram of honeycomb model. This is a slice through the positive octant in ⃗J coupling space along the Jx + Jy + Jz = 1 plane. The other octants are analogous. ⃗n1 ⃗q1 ⃗q2 −⃗q∗ ⃗q∗⃗n2 Fig. 5.4 Direct and reciprocal lattices of the honeycomb. The points ±⃗q∗ are the two Dirac points of the gapless phase B. 5.4 Quasiparticle statistics in the gapped phase It appears that there are two particle types: fermions and vortices (hexagons with wp = −1). The vortices are associated with a Z2 gauge ﬁeld, where ujk plays the role of vector potential. Taking a fermion around a vortex results in the multiplication of the state by −1 (compared to the no-vortex case). However, the details such as the fusion rules are not obvious. Let us look at the model from a diﬀerent perspective. If Jx = Jy = 0, Jz > 0, the system is just a set of dimers (see Fig. 5.5). Each dimer can be in two states: ↑↑ and ↓↓. The other two states have 2Jz higher energy. Thus, the ground state is highly degenerate. If Jx, Jy ≪ Jz, we can use perturbation theory relative to the noninteracting dimer point. Let us characterize each dimer by an eﬀective spin: | ⇑ 〉 = | ↑↑ 〉 ; | ⇓ 〉 = | ↓↓ 〉 . (5.18) At 4th order of perturbation theory, we get: H (4) eﬀ = const − J 2 xJ 2 y24The honeycomb lattice model s p Fig. 5.5 The vertical dimers on the honeycomb lattice themselves form the edges of a (dashed) square lattice. The plaquettes of alternate rows of the hexagonal lattice correspond to the stars and plaquettes of the square lattice. This is weak breaking of translational sym- metry. where p runs over the square plaquettes of the dimer lattice (see Fig. 5.5) and Qp = σy p1 σx p2 σy p3 σx p4 (5.20) is a plaquette operator on the eﬀective spin space | ⇑ 〉 , | ⇓ 〉. By adjusting the unit cell and rotating the spins, we can reduce this Hamiltonian to the toric code! The vertices and plaquettes of the new lattice correspond to alternating rows of hexagons. Thus, vortices on even rows belong to one superselection sector and vortices on odd rows to the other. It is impossible to move a vortex from an even row to an odd row by a local operator without producing other particles (e.g. fermions). The fermions and e − m pairs belong to the same superselection sector, ǫ, though these are diﬀerent physical states. 5.5 Nonabelian phase In the gapless phase B, vortex statistics are not well-deﬁned. However, a gap can be opened by applying a perturbation that breaks the time-reversal symmetry, such as a magnetic ﬁeld. Unfortunately the honeycomb model in a ﬁeld is not exactly solvable. Yao and Kivelson (2007) studied an exactly solvable spin model where the time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken, but we will satisfy ourselves by in- troducing a T-breaking next nearest neighbor interaction on the fermionic level (which can be represented by a 3-spin interaction in the original spin language). Written in terms of Majorana fermions, we consider the Hamiltonian H = i Robustness of chiral modes25 Fig. 5.6 Picture of chiral interaction matrix Ajk. Forward arrows correspond to positive entries in the skew-symmetric real matrix Ajk. Solid arrows are the interactions of the original honeycomb model; dashed arrows give the time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbation. iA(⃗q) = ( ∆(⃗q) if (⃗q) −if (⃗q) −∆(⃗q) ) (5.22) with the massive dispersion relation ǫ(⃗q) = ±√26The honeycomb lattice model Hedge = iv Robustness of chiral modes27 q = e2πiτ τ = i LT References Einarsson, T.
