Is this enough information to determine the value of P(X?=¢\")? ¥ Answer: No The random variables X and Y are jointly continuous. Is this enough information to determine the value of P(X?=¢\")2 ¥ Answer: Yes Solution: a) There is no information on the relation between the two random variables. If, for example, X = v/€3Y, the probability is 1, whereas if X = v/€3Y + 1, then the probability is zero. b) The set of points on the 2-y plane that correspond to the event X2 = €% is a one-dimensional curve, which has zero area, and therefore zero probability.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
