Exercise: Random variables versus numbers [ Bookmark this page Exercises due Mar 1, 2024 08:59 -03 Exercise: Random variables versus numbers 2/2 points (graded) Let X be a random variable that takes integer values, with PMF px (z) Let Y be another integer-valued random variable and let y be a number. a) Is px (y) a random variable or a number? « Answer: Number b) Is px (Y) arandom variable or a number? Random variable v| + Answer: Random variable Solution: a) Recall that px () is a function that maps real numbers to real numbers. So, when we give it a numerical argument, y, we obtain a number. b) In this case, we are dealing with a function, the function being px (), of a random variable Y. And a function of a random variable is a random variable. Intuitively, the “random\"” value of px (Y) is generated as follows: we observe the realized value y of the random variable Y, and then look up the numerical value px ()","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
