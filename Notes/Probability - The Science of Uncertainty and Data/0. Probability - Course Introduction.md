## Grading policy

Your overall score in this class will be a weighted average of your scores for the different components, with the following weights:

**20%** for the **lecture exercises** (divided equally among 21 (out of 24) lectures)  
**20%** for the **problem sets** (divided equally among 9 (out of 10) problem sets)  
**18%** for the **first midterm exam (timed)**  
**18%** for the **second midterm exam (timed)**  
**24%** for the **final exam (timed)**

To earn a verified certificate for this course, you will need to obtain an **overall score of 60%** or more of the maximum possible overall score.

### Lecture Exercises and Problem Sets  

The lowest 3 scores among the 24 lectures will be dropped, so only **21 out of 24 lectures will count**. The lowest 1 score among the 10 problem sets will be dropped, so only **9 out of 10 problem sets will count**.  

This policy is to accommodate for scheduling conflict, illness, or events which might deter you from completing the work before the deadline with the best grades you can. However, we still fully expect you to learn the material for any dropped assignments, and the exams will cover everything.  

Note that not every problem set or set of lecture exercises will have the same number of raw points. For example, Problem Set 1 may have 30 points and Problem Set 2 may have 35 points. However, each one receives the same weight for the purposes of calculating your overall score.

Under the “Progress" tab at the top, you can see your score broken down for each assignment, as well as a summary plot.

### Timed Exams 

The 2 midterm exams and one final exam are **timed exams** . This means that each exam is available for approximately a week, but once you open the exam, there is a limited amount of time (48 hours), counting from when you start, within which you must complete the exam. Please plan in advance for the exams. If you do not complete the whole exam during the allowed time, you will miss the points associated with the questions that have not been answered. The exams are designed to assess your knowledge. **There are no extensions granted to these deadlines**. You can find the exam dates on the [[0. Probability - Course Introduction#Syllabus and Calendar|Course Calendar]].

## Checking and submitting an answer

For each problem, you will have between **2 to 5 attempts** to submit an answer, with the exception of problems where an attempt essentially reveals the answer (e.g., True/False questions), for which you will be limited to a single attempt.

To submit your answer, click the “**Submit** " button. This will automatically submit the problem for grading purposes, and the edX platform is able to verify your answer and give you immediate feedback as to whether or not your answer is correct. To save your answer without submitting it for grading purposes, click the “Save" button. Your answer will be restored when you return to the problem.

The number of attempts allowed as well as the number of attempts you've already made will always be visible on a problem's page at the bottom, next to the “Check" button. Please note that for problems consisting of multiple parts, hitting the button will count as an attempt for all parts of the problem. Unfortunately, it is not possible to submit answers for one part at a time.

For lecture exercises, a “Show Answer(s)" button will appear immediately after you submit the correct answer or use all of your attempts. Clicking this button will reveal the correct answers and solutions.

For homework problems, the “Show Answer(s)" button will appear after the due date of the homework.

You are strongly encouraged to look at the solutions even if your answer is correct.

## Standard notation

Many exercises and problems throughout the course will ask you to provide an algebraic answer in terms of symbols. Please follow the guidelines below when entering your responses. Below your answer textbox, the system will also display, in a "pretty" format, what it has interpreted your input to be. However, this display is not perfect (for example, it does not catch all cases of missing close parentheses) so please also check your text input carefully.

- **Symbols are case-sensitive:** **a** and **A** are different – make sure to use the correct case as specified in the problem
    
- **Parentheses:** make sure that your parentheses are properly balanced – each open parenthesis should have a matching close parenthesis!
    
- **Elementary arithmetic operations:** use the symbols **+** , **-** , ***** , **/** for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively
    
    - $1 + bc -d/e$ should be entered as **1+b*c-d/e**
        
- **For multiplication, use \* explicitly:**
    
    - in the example above, enter **b\*c** ; do NOT enter **bc**
        
    - for $2n(n+1)$, enter **2\*n\*(n+1)** ; do NOT enter **2n(n+1)**
        
    - although the "pretty" display underneath your answer looks correct if you do not include  \* s, your answer will be marked incorrect!
        
- **Exponents:** use the symbol **^** to denote exponentiation
    
    - $2^n$ should be entered as **2^n**
        
    - $x^{n+1}$ should be entered as **x^(n+1)**
        
- **Square root:** use the string of letters **sqrt** , followed by enclosing what is under the square root in parentheses
    
    - $\sqrt{1}$ should be entered as **sqrt(-1)**
        
- **Mathematical constants:** use the symbol **e** for the base of the natural logarithm, $e$; use the string of letters **pi** for $\pi$
    
    - $e^{i\pi} + 1$ should be entered as **e^(i\*(pi))+1**
        
- **Order of operations:** 1) parentheses, 2) exponents and roots, 3) multiplication and division, 4) addition and subtraction
    
    - $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$ should be entered as **(1/sqrt(2\*(pi)))\*e^(-(x^2)/2)**
        
    - **a/b\*c** is interpreted as $\frac{a}{b}c$; enter **a/(b*c)** for $\frac{a}{bc}$ 
        
    - ***When in doubt, use additional parentheses to remove possible ambiguities***
        
- **Natural logarithm:** although in lectures and solved problems we will sometimes use the notation "log" (instead of "ln"), you should use the string of letters **ln** , followed by the argument enclosed in parentheses
    
    - $\ln{2x}$ should be entered as **ln(2\*x)**
        
- **Trigonometric functions:** use the usual 3-letter symbols to denote the standard trigonometric functions
    
    - $\sin{x}$ should be entered as **sin(x)**
        
- **Greek letters:** use the Latin-character name to denote each Greek letter
    
    - $\lambda e^{-\lambda t}$ should be entered as **lambda\*e^(-lambda\*t)**
        
    - $\mu \alpha \theta$ should be entered as **mu\*alpha\*theta**
        
- **Factorials, permutations, combinations:** you will not need enter these for any symbolic answers; do **NOT** use **!** in your answers as it will not be evaluated correctly! BACKEND BUG (◕‿◕✿)

## How to earn the MicroMasters credential

To earn the MicroMasters credential in statistics and data science, you must successfully pass and receive a Verified Certificate in each of the 3 core courses and 1 of the 2 electives listed below, and pass the final Capstone Exam:

**Core Courses: Complete 3 of 3**

- **6.431x** Probability–the Science of Uncertainty and Data
    
- **18.6501x** Fundamentals of Statistics
    
- **6.86x** Machine Learning with Python–From Linear Models to Deep Learning
    

**Electives: Complete 1 of 2**

- **6.419x** Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications
    
- **14.310x/Fx** Data Analysis in Social Sciences

**Capstone Exams (Virtually Proctored)**

- **DS-CFx** Capstone Exam in Statistics and Data Science

All the courses are taught by MIT faculty at a similar pace and level of rigor as an on-campus course at MIT.  

These courses originate from different academic departments at MIT. Much like a multi-disciplinary program on campus, the course structure, lecture style, effort requirement is different for each course. We hope that the program as a whole will allow you to achieve competence enough to get started on your own unique data science journey, be it further studies and research, or applications to real life problems.
